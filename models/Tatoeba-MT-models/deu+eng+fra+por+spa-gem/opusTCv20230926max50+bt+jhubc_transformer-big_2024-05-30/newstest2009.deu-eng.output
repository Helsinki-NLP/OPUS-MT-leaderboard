The Prague Stock Exchange is plunging against closing.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s shares amounted to almost half of normal day-to-day trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange followed Monday’s downturn at the start of Tuesday’s trades as it fell by another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the break-in was Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there, is evident.
Fall of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, shares on the Asian stock exchanges saw a dramatic fall, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index lost almost four percentage points over the course of the business day, but could later compensate for some of the losses, thus decreasing to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then decreased losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese stock market fell 3.6 percent after the Taiwanese index.
“The timing for the U.S. rescue operation is uncertain and will affect the global financial markets,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and pass the draft financial system support.
Otherwise, more countries would also be affected by the break-in.
A Bloodbath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion K<0xC4><0x8D>) should be spent.
Legislators ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices recorded the largest decline in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped nearly seven percent, with a similar decline last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little evidence that the draft would not pass through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress Makes Concessions: U.S. Government May Pump $700 Billion Into Banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
It will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. legislators made a breakthrough in talks about passing a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
Congress members have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee Barney Frank told Reuters.
The Senate said it was likely to vote on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a notification that the plan is being adopted should be the first major psychological factor for a revival of the financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there is a "disenchantment" due to the complicated mechanisms that could help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on what a market stabilization package should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to him, a final vote could be held on Sunday.
Legislators met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of unsold mortgage assets from financial companies, which plunge financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We need to continue the health plan, but I think we’re at the finish line,” Paulson said.
A Signal to Asia Businesses
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are declining sharply.
In the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
The aim is to reassure investors of doing business on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a congressional decision could affect Monday’s business.
Until now, however, it is not entirely clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether negotiations at the last minute could still fail on a problem.
Legislators hope that it will pass in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo some changes.
The total amount intended to help the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
But Congress can block the disbursement of the remaining money if it feels that the program does not perform its function, at another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush considers progress in negotiations positive
Although the president has a veto on this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was based on obtaining finances for the purchase of poor mortgage securities whose value has fallen, has remained because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and “appreciated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate banking committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, concluding benefits, and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law will also restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and establish a committee to oversee the fund.
The Treasury is to lead it.
“We’ve been working very hard on it and making great progress toward an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new installments on mortgages it buys up, with the goal being to lower the monthly cost to debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Aid
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"That's because you don't know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week is not decisive in Marek’s view.
“It’s more important that Congress members agree to support the plan and pass it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that there is a passing is the most important at this moment,” Marek stressed.
Duel on knife cutting edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost any phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls yet.
Therefore, of course, it looks like it is better to buy only one phone.
Yet, there are plenty of reasons why you should get a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Surely you can hardly buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this either.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with traveling music, i.e. with compressed music, in a simplified way - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For one it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but likewise a pink floyd fan will hardly handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don’t even make it implying.
No modern device can be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, the phone and the Sims, it can play music and videos, both record, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera, and maybe it can also navigate.
And if you also include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It is a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
However, the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music longer than ten to twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should count on cheap phones that they can’t play music for more than a few hours.
If you are still talking on the phone from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good ones last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one-time recharging.
There is another problem when you want to play the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB port, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones without reduction.
For players, except for exceptions (iPod), you do not need special software.
You only need to feed the device with music from your PC via USB port.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or for example the rating by users.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When selecting a specific device, you should in particular inquire about the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and of course also the ease of operation.
If music is especially a backdrop for you and you only listen to it briefly every day, for example in the tram, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost every mobile phone can do.
You also don’t have to control which music formats a mobile phone or player can handle.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and in addition, most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better phones also make it possible to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of one provider (or another provider) via the mobile internet, and you can already buy a song or album.
This service can in itself be a striking argument for why you should buy a music cell phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and is usually limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most of them carry the phone with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is lying at home forgotten.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least one wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can resort to the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of the music phones will be in the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest disability for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically mature phones with a 3.5 mm opening for regular headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is the ease of use.
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - players can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the former normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of a erroneously employed mobile internet and a subsequent horrendous invoice for data transmissions.
Which device should you use now
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns will suffice.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you will then not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have standalone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of operation comes close to that of a single MP3 player.
The farthest is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) you can afford MP3 players of the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe...
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all the services offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics at lower prices.
Maybe it won’t wait long.
That the Czech mobile operators work among the most expensive in Europe, we have already reported many times on Mobil.cz.
This was also confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the European Commission’s final steps in the area of roaming fees regulation, there is so likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile carriers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are the prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
The chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, who in the past had often said that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic, often agrees.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of chances (otherwise, it would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market led to a significant price reduction, to which then also the classic mobile providers had to react.
Before such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, there were similar votes as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been proven that there is room for such providers and that they can really succeed.
By the way, you don’t have to look long for examples.
In February, we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider succeeded in attracting more than 100 thousand customers and thus becoming the country’s fifth-largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual vendors need far fewer customers than a traditional vendor.
They do not require relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to bet on a non-clichéd target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operating company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept as in Poland could also make a foothold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offering."
In the Czech Republic there is no chance, say the mobile operators
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile carrier conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be mobileking.
"While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region,” said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a phone call for Mobil.cz.
It indirectly confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that there is no potential competitor.
Their interest in launching a virtual mobile provider has long been demonstrated by the GTS Novera Group, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line, but also mobile telecommunication services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already made progress in negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the Group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specificities compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the Telefónica O2 press department in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other suppliers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds, rarely in line with O2’s statement, “So far we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to continue to build on.”
And she adds: “On the T-Mobile network, hardly any virtual vendor will appear by the end of the year.
At this moment we would have to have a concrete offer already to be able to think in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The approach of the mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would be more competition, this would lead to declining prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why should we make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull on one strand when it comes to something also proves the long way back and forth about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> came at the time when U:fon came on the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
Now, U:fon is suitable as an argument for why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile carrier.
Given the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
Given this approach, however, the total disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which unfortunately does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic, unlike in the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries.
It has the exclusive Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem his very typical attitude.
“The entry into the market of a virtual mobile carrier would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile carrier and a virtual provider about the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential prospects was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic suppliers", according to Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS in his response to our question.
Of representatives of the suppliers, such a formulation would not come as a surprise.
This is more than worrying for an authority that represents the interests of consumers and, inter alia, ensures that no one abuses its position in the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual providers operate normally, it is observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not in the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Really shocking in this case is the almost already stirring harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same gasoline price at the gas stations is certainly only coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
“The Authority has found no evidence in this matter that suggests anti-competitive action, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions in the market.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market for virtual providers are likely to be lacking in the regulatory authority for telecommunications,” Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for a virtual provider to enter the market.
And the cellular provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily assumes a dominant position in a certain segment.
However, even if you do not follow this argument, it should at least be a warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile carriers act strikingly similarly.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all providers.
The transfer of responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act failed to enforce the extension of the competences of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> to the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay when no one looks
First of all, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are equally many in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partially public.
Usually these are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile phone services, for example, offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual terms with which we will then deal, which can lead to a termination of cooperation with the corresponding company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not be discussed with the responsible of the mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
The activities of these companies do not give them negligible profits, at the same time they are not affected - unlike the actual virtual providers - by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epický points out possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite this, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it like the normal customers of the mobile carriers.
This alone, however, should at least seem strange to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
Another question opens up for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If the mobile operators close their eyes to such an action, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has fairly strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the suppliers’ statement that they do not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasized several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers led to a significant price drop in the various services.
In practically all the countries where virtual providers have been created, the classic providers have tried to prevent their creation practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, regulatory bodies intervened at these moments, which in no way sought to safeguard the interests of the mobile operators but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator emerged, and others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing themselves all over the case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that uncertainty in the competences in these cases is more than favorable.
But let's not throw the shotgun in the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon start moving again.
If a provider allows the emergence of a virtual mobile carrier, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain idle when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not be more expensive to make phone calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech State Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my homeland.
The anthem was newly performed by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
Four versions are available - with male or female solo singing, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka took over the singing.
The editors of the anthem versions are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions at once.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems.
Earlier, he told the Czech Radio that he had chosen singers for the solo variants with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular.
“From the beginning, I tried to maintain a clear diction with both of them and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well, so that a harmony can be created,” the conductor said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Standetheater in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music originated from Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first stanza of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" anthem sound like?
Prague transport operators also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will go into the history of Prague’s transport companies as a date when the first passengers will board a subway, tram or bus, carrying an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who have the chip card OpenCard.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it placed on their chip card at the information centers and branch offices of the transport companies at the Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í, Kaly<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>lis, Letý<0xC5><0x9B>l, Ro<0xC4><0x9B>z
The coupons have been available since yesterday via the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the internet sales can really forget the issue window at the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the open card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points there is also a desk with trained staff at the disposal of travelers, which advises prospective buyers on the internet and also places the coupon on the card," said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-service vending machines on the open card, which are attached in some subway vestibules.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, recall ticket devaluers, passengers may have noticed them at the underground stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"At present there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there are supposed to be eighty," Opatrný adds.
A machine controls the coupon instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon will play on its own.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants of the municipalities of the region Central Bohemia arrive in the capital.
"In trains that are part of Prague's integrated traffic, the train attendants have readers that allow them to check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the organisation Ropid the ticket control, which compiles the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the checkout at the driver.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed in a marked place on the side of the checkout.
In this way, the driver checks the validity of the coupons played.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not use suburban buses and no longer know when the coupon will expire can go to the self-service vending machines, where the coupons will be placed on the card.
Here the information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States.
The Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States in 1945.
This is evident from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we would like to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten-Germans are said to have turned to the US President in 1945.
This can be seen, among other things, from a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich Agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units are not entering German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it said in a letter signed with the words "people to whom the fate of the Sudeten lies at heart."
Since the follow-up to Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudeten Germans, in the knowledge of the Czech national character, would expect brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for ever and ever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you have attributed this area to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and tries to eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing at all to the victory of the Allies," the letter read.
The reason why the authors are unable to sign is allegedly the fear of revenge cravings of the “Czech oppressors”.
If the US president has doubts about the sentiment of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he initiated a referendum in Bohemian Forest Gauge on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the US or live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, it, however, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, draws a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Bohemian Germans at least had to suspect that they would be negotiated about their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them admitted such an opportunity at all.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
In the war, he was a Budweiser German in the navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he arrived in British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that if they came home, they would have the Czech language,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, in his opinion, expected that he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
If you don't think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive action for road safety in Czech history.
This is also how the emotionally charged media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, could be characterized.
The authority of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to discourage drivers from dangerous behavior behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million kronor will run on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on flyers.
It is said to discourage drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remind themselves to strap before starting the ride.
The campaign aims to bring awareness to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people appealing to emotions.
The whole campaign's "bloody" slogan also bears witness to this:
If you don't think - then pay!
The words "think not" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a bloodshed there is the word "pay."
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see images with drastic shots of victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and the number of traffic deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for drivers
"For the drivers, the motto is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that when you drive in red, for example, you save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án hospital.
And that’s why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
In his opinion, even less effective are panels that alert drivers to a danger.
“If you set up a static panel that warns of danger, it will probably soon flow to the surroundings and the drivers will not notice it anymore,” Ko<0xC5><0x99>án says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Chairman of the Provisional Government of Israel Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all the territories that were occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if one could conclude peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for it.
He stressed this in an interview, which was printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to hand over a similar percentage to the Palestinians (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
“Those who want security in Jerusalem and most importantly do not want tractors or bulldozers rolling over their legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple berns and holy and historical places" that lie on the territory of the old town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he continued.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert called for Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
"The Syrians know all too well what they have to do without to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they provide to the Hamas movement’s terrorism, the Al-Khaida terror network, and the jihad in Iraq,” he said.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, it is not allowed to travel around in a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travelers are allowed to run back and forth during the journey on the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess was killed last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the road with the bus.
The young woman was sitting next to the driver in the least secure seat in the car at that moment, to all odds, even though she had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident at the moment or braking sharply when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with standing positions according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, the passengers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing places, which the company's director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, confirmed to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not initially agree to the movement of travelers.
Later, this has been withdrawn, and we have reached a consensus that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet during the ride if they have their seat," he said.
The law knows no steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward – no legislation describes that role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of vehicle companions, but does not define its rights and obligations," added the spokesman for the Ministry of Hanzelka.
The Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, says that the law covers this problem subsequently.
"It depends on whether the bus has standing positions in the product approval.
That’s all,” he stressed.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing places and maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed, and long-distance buses without standing places at the highest permissible speed, and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín sees the movement of stewards on board a bus as not a fundamental problem.
"With a smooth ride, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an airplane.
Again, it’s not sure when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can shove her head.”
"But if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations," he says and also says that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company providing stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this role.
The director does not consider their profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will remove him.
Coffee and newspapers can be provided to travelers on board.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in his bus, but his company operates only a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we've been fighting back from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he had said about Týden.cz a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was injured.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the strip without blinking and had blocked the bus from traveling.
The driver of the bus tried to dodge by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two seats were sold for the stewards.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects financial damages from the culprit.
A law change?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a statutory regulation that a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has already worked on for over a year.
“But this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are not necessarily on the agenda either, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving," said Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that could significantly endanger the safety of the passengers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of the buses being the competence of the police and occupational safety authorities.
Dusseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of big words in the letter from the WestLB board to the employees of the house.
The merger of units of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka Bank could create "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe", says the letter announced on Monday.
WestLB brings a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And in general, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further consolidations in the state banking sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision, which the North Rhine-Westphalia state government has only recently made clear, is pushing the time to find a solution for the future.
The connection between the Deka Bank, which savings bank customers know about because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has been mentioned for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
While Deka-Bank chief Franz Waas, in presenting the half-yearly figures at the end of August, said he did not see any sense in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a state bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is each supported by half of the state banks and the savings bank associations, has commissioned the Board of Directors to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have just begun, it is said at the financial centre.
The Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial centre, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings banking sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing became of this three-way covenant.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government objected to the Helaba’s participation in it.
The other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been thought games about a connection of the Deka-Bank with state banks.
However, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had recently spoken out against Planspiele about a meeting with his house.
Regardless of this, however, the realization seems to mature that a consolidation of the various houses of the public sector is necessary.
After the Landtagswahlen in Bavaria is over, a connection between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first step.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, the partners gradually assume it.
In the south, it would only be more junior partners, although it has so far withstood the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thüringen Sparkassen- und Giroverband, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, pushed a bar to join West LB at the beginning of the year.
At best, the Nord LB remained.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about the question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit with each other.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of which business model should be used to ensure the future viability of the state banks had not been answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband so far.
In the end, there could also be a dismantling of the West LB, which, however, of course, is not desired there.
Thus, the letter of the board of directors there also mentions that there is in any case an "overall solution" for the house.
How this can be combined with the merging of individual units with the Deka Bank will be shown.
The second meadow weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
This is the first time for Elena and the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena is there as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer keg of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively constructed beard and proves to the about 200 Oktoberfest travelers how deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova train station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", start this evening at 11.45 p.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing beside their flag already, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that’s nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur lining and glasses with wide silver braces, includes the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours alone this year.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, back at 10.30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - inclusive.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers sleeping.
Well, you'll still need your strength.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where many other buses with Italian license plates take a break just before Munich.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in fracture, next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors open to the beer tent, it is said to run!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, distribute in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget tip.
“Tell the security officers that we behave well.
As soon as you leave the seats, they’re gone.”
Third, "Tonight's point is half-eleven!" You understand?
We're off to the Wiesn.
Along the way, a yellow cap is attached to the trees, signs and even the election poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
They want to be prepared for retreat.
It is the second meadow weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There is no precise information on numbers; there are 50,000 people who make their way across the Alps and come to the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are said to have come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers supporting the Bavarian Red Cross, which carries a nation-statistics in which the Italians take first place in front of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical services.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
It’s good that the politician used the word “relative” and that the German banking sector was not spared from the crisis.
This has happened over the weekend.
The Munich real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield himself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part that it also claims.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses to the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier had refinanced himself for long-term projects for which he has lent money, extremely short-term - which is now no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve had shrunk by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had also declined slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, while income from credit allocations to receivables and certain securities and from the dissolution of provisions in credit transactions fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from reimbursement of downstream transfer costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the tax regulations and from the management of group companies, had the earnings decrease of around 16 percent still fallen moderately.
The former state financier had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans after his privatization in 1990, which had then been outsourced to Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of income in traditional state financing, Depfa had then become more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make amortizations that will have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite indefinite.
The fact is that the dividend has been removed.
In 2007, it was cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks has again largely dried up as the banks are hoarding their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding annually for a portion of Depfa’s loan portfolio – around 50 billion euros.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is “protected from the influence of the currently largely inoperative international money markets.”
It can be heard from other sources that thanks to the funds the refinancing was secured by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke said, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take advantage of the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is to be hoped for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that the financing does not have to be fully utilized.
But also the opposite is not to be worn out.
After hearing the bank was still before bankruptcy late on Sunday evening, even the at least provisional rescue cannot reassure the minds.
The share price falls by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond prices, on the other hand, are pretty good.
While the priority debt is hardly moving, the prices of the subordinated bonds yield more clearly.
It is mainly the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and understandably the maturities beyond 2009 that are affected.
If hypo-real-estate bonds appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less-affected commercial banks are ready to support the system, a timely repayment of pensions can be assumed.
Or else something happens that hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports overlapping with partial nationalization, the probability that borders on security has at present only become a legitimate hope.
This is especially likely to prepare long-term creditors for a few sleepless nights with the decision to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can use a closing line to form a loss presentation for future remuneration tax payments on price gains in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to giggle: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells of Japan.
The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before school, I had bamboo.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the class does not seem to be as strictly defined at the Tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The pupils enter from eight o’clock until at twenty nine a.m. a short meeting round begins with the teacher, the ‘home room’.
But before class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk in front of people, or in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my guest mother, plus a blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and have my birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all squeaked, whispered and whispered and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, cute'.
Then I quickly get stuck in my place.
The girl next to me grinned quite broadly, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really stormed.
Everyone talked confused and giggled and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone packed out their Bentos.
My guest mother had also made me such a lunch box - this is sometimes something different than the deserted German breaks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad made from cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofumantel.
I usually don’t have a pale glimmer of what I’m eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salted plums maybe, brrrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then prepares especially artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy closer at the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I’m curious if I can watch this too.
‘Why Japan?’ my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
“Because it fascinates me.”
After all, I’ve loved reading mangas for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in them, I also started learning a bit of Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that I had to travel here someday.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they are very much valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here yet, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
Does a rat or a cockroach flee in danger mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same if they behave similarly to us?
For several years, the internet magazine "Edge" has published contributions of famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove this so far, where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it stands dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least with those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since so much of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so animal consciousness, whatever it may be, is likely to differ greatly from most of our consciousness states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically more accessible.
One could study the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies of the short-term memory of primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But with this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one relies more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the emergence of visualization.
What does this mean for the sensations?
I trace them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) proves memory.
In this sense, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that distinguish primates and in particular humans.
Connected with linguistic nature, there are fine gradations of feeling, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio suggests that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and the brain stem arise similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could be involved in cross-genus sensations.
Purely theoretically, I cannot disagree with this, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans probably feels like this in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same if they behave similarly?
Does a sheep flee in danger if it also feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove experience equality.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain strains, cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if it could be proven for humans, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior of rats rather than the emotional sensations.
In any case, progress on the neural level is wavering here, as long as you measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, so do not sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You may think that’s shortsighted, but I’d rather move on than constantly running against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
“The government sees UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the EM together with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts lag behind.
The number of EM stadiums may even be reduced from eight to six.
“We can no longer waste time.
We must now work at top speed,” said Ukrainian President Grigorij Surkis.
“Uefa will keep an eye on us all the time.”
An even more radical move was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer."
Several first league players had been sentenced to forced descent for manipulation alone last season, after all, even the league start had to be postponed shortly.
Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about privates in an interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her missing Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
The foaming - and beating back.
Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant fight with each other - in public.
In an interview last week with InStyle, Ryan said: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful.”
The extent of the fraud was discovered only after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - told the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s response to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: “It’s horrible,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, “that Meg repeatedly re-cheats and re-seals the history of our relationship.”
It is also “sad” that the common 16-year-old son Jack is once again “publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so his admissions conclude with the side stroke: "My life goes on anyway.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well.”
Airline and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and hotel accommodations have become cheaper again, according to a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its first-half 2008 booking data and found a significant decline in the second quarter following an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After prices in the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already been cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the weak dollar rate as the cause of this, which has led to a "decreasing desire for American tourists to travel."
Financial venues such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices hold the record in Europe, up 26.3 percent.
The trend in airfares also showed up in the first quarter:
Due to kerosene fuel consumption, travelers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even more expensive as much as 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for economy-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business-class and first-class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
The reason for the price drop is on the one hand the decreasing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand is crumbling in many segments of the aviation travel market.
On the other hand, the open skies agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, puts increased pressure on competition.
The stressful situation is due to the cancellation of unprofitable routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes leader of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a functioning eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein increase break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher only came into play late and failed with a lifter to the latte.
His message was precise, it went convincingly over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin entrance of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were sitting back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a higher reputation than some of the lost actors.
And so his request was also heard in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumbs in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg’s head coach Martin Jol.
His command sounded similar: Go with Gate Two!
Implementation remained.
“It wasn’t nice to watch today,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have been more relaxed.
The Hamburgers owe the 1-0 (1:0) to Mladen Petric’s headshot (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
“It was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol summed it up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class premiere.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to classify that,” said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate testimony represents more the unpredictability of the league than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late entries - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen recruited by FC Bayern - is slow, but not yet able to shine.
“We need more flair and more dribbling,” Jol said.
After the voting defeat
There is fear on Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily fall by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss in a day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer traded at 10,579 counters at a minus of just over five percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down by more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could win.
The shares of Goldman Sachs declined by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
As part of the bailout plan, the funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the sum is to be paid out not in one stroke, but incrementally.
In return, the state should receive stock option notes from the financial companies, which could be redeemed with appropriate price developments to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the United States downwards
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the United States does not address investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and tears the Dax downwards.
The US Dow Jones Index loses despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses from Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have driven the German Stock Index (Dax) deeply down.
The share of the Munich real estate financer lost at times three-quarters of its value despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, with Commerzbank yielding by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped clearly below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and scored a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The stock markets all over the world went down on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the Senate vote could follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading Nikkei index fell by 1.26% to 11,743.61 counters after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng Index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75.
In the MDax, Arcandor shares yielded after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused insanity in research: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
Nearly 18 years ago, the Ulysses spacecraft flew through space.
Because of the freezing of fuel lines soon you are now in danger of cold death.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon - the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional swing in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been surprised at for years now: the missiles do not behave 100% as would be expected under the ancient law of gravity.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton remains firmly convinced that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously emanates an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, in particular no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter makes up about one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists deported to Egypt will be free again, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded several million euros of ransom.
Six hostages were reportedly killed in a shooting before their release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Redemption negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans are being targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE outlines the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab TV channel Al-Arabiya and Italian media in agreement.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports from the Italian TV station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the official said.
It was “just about receiving the hostages” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt killed six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German intermediary, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman committing suicide, a court has reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after confessing to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly bound his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
The court learned, however, that Ms. Randle, who worked for the National Trust on a voluntary basis for much of her time, was prosecuted for the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "given up her life".
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
It is believed that she killed herself by choking herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended with, “I used to bind her and bind her eyes.”
“I didn’t sexually force them.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and for their victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still, the fact is that it is highly unlikely that the case would have ended in court if she had not done so.”
He added, “I note the impact, according to Stephanie’s father and mother, her act has had on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman.”
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet official, who lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was seconded by the Department of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action came as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said: “They thought it would be dealing with internally at the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet.”
The employee whose name cannot be named will be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe retention of information.
The Royal Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published contained classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Home construction companies look at B&B costs
British housing companies could face costs of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
The director general of the Association of Housing Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid if Bradford & Bingley’s loans are repaid.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is counted against those 700 financial companies that accept deposits each year.
The Financial Services Compensation Program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies must raise <0xC2><0xA3>81 million for the first year’s interest.
Adrian Coles, the director general of the Association of Housing Societies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate boom are now called on to bear some of the costs from those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
“We will be watching every aspect of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives are available to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs.”
The interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both-sided organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk gets five pence per liter more expensive
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, following a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm have been conducted.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said the court refused bail regarding the charge of blackmailing 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina’s long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government first grant her unrestricted freedom.
The correspondents say that although her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is unclear whether she will be able to remain free if she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
“The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina’s plea for bail because it says she doesn’t have to be granted bail because she is already being suspended abroad to be treated abroad,” her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file an appeal against the Supreme Court.”
Her lawyers argue that she needs bail to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami Alliance party chairman said Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-supported transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations last week conducted a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or obstruct thousands of employees carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its action against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court of Appeal has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB’s share distorts competition and allows it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from acquiring ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB’s purchase of the share in ITV raises doubts about the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, Consumer Groups and the Communications Office of Ofcom have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the termination of the nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administration staff were criticized.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Specialist investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the justice system.
Serious allegations including criminal action have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that the prosecutors would be fired due to poor work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had been judged no worse than many of their colleagues, prompting many observers to consider the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of election fraud by the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting legal cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has been under fire because of the redundancies and has, in the end, resigned his office.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General’s report addressed Gonzales’ role critically, bearing the “main responsibility” for the redundancies, “abandoning” his leadership role and showing “extraordinarily disinterested” in the process.
Other officials, including former senior adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for the lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's Epic Song Will Be Honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf will be honored during the music awards ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize next week in London during the awards ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the cover of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
“Coldplay” leads the nominations for this year’s awards after being narrowly selected in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of Q Magazine Paul Rees said there were some songs that went beyond such subjects as time and genre and “Bat Out Of Hell” was certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years on the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was surgery in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute throat infection.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal ribbon.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side streets and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are just convenient.
Still, even for experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals, it’s hard to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used passageway.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It aims to re-patch Extra Place to create a clean passage to the stores and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the block’s past.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the City Council Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay devised a proposal to buy the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district official in the Municipal Council 3.
“Very little space has remained in the city’s possession and we want Extra Place to remain in the city’s possession,” she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would re-patch the small road and set up seats designed, among other things, for a café where the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road, but it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the road and stressed that the department’s task was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historic impression.
Some believe the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock memorial, which closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is probably best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's vanishing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Dying City"), has published part of the city's history talk about Extra Place, which appeared in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusty metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weekly old newspapers flying past rain gutters."
With a few exceptions, the road looked just like this recently in one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road might be a bit uppolarized.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, wet, and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this issue of the Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Research Fellow in Caliphonic Studies and Senior Director of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book “Not As Good As One Thinks: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Selection.”
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the probability of successful completion of school in African-American and Hispanic students is lower than in white students” – which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among others, a bilingual transitional phase in education for those who are first learning English.
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school achievements.
Take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles, for example.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, astonishing 100 percent of fourth-class students passed the state exam in mathematics at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93% of fourth-year school children were rated as good in the English exam.
This astonishing success has been achieved by methods other than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and practice, constant control of knowledge, and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school is practicing the approach that education takes place in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly what Obama should be aware of, says school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach attaches importance to the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialized teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later you would enter the classroom and you would not be able to recognize him.
“It works,” she said, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learners?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within his own party (the national picture associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s answer uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about the “English-only” legislation.
Instead, he said, “You should make sure your child can speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close the gap, he must carefully consider educational models that work, rather than contempt and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall due to renewed fears about the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel during the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by both Wall Street financial turmoil and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 per barrel in July, prices dropped to nearly $90 per barrel this month, then rising again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors again expressed concern, despite congressional representatives announcing that they had agreed on a rescue plan over the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the foreseeable final chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, Citigroup is expected to buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a bailout plan, it appears to have failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts from Deutsche Bank have written in a statement to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they will continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.”
Analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and lowered their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Insider Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen it all after he’d run up more often than anyone else in the jets jersey over the past eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumphant move.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
After a muddy match between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals that matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favre’s pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, that marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in that quarter for two more touchdowns, one of which slipped out as an outsider and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half.
“I didn’t do much effort,” Coles says of the passports that went to Coles.
“He’s a super player.
We voted no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catching, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner broke apart.
Outside defender Darrelle Revis caught a crashed throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced on Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
Those were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, replied, “The second quarter or the third quarter?”
In response to both, because the jets left 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third quarter.
A lot of points were scored in a short time.”
Rested Gebrselassie beats its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to make the 42.2 km route in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he reached at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, out of fear that air pollution might exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train racers like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long distances, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result of 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Obviously he was refreshed after a break and did not come back rusting.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He has been criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rival from East Africa – for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the track in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers slowed down.
Just over three miles ahead of the finish, Gebrselassie made his last appearance to separate from Kwambai, who was second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by nearly 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, finished a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing, due to problems described as back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She cleverly planned her run by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners torn out, but overtaken after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardships in the lives of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden among the thrills of theme parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic hustle and bustle, is a quiet city where the pride and complications of African American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquettes, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous Harlem Renaissance author.
And yet, the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist destination by taking it to the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Federal Writers’ Project in times of depression – is and remains in many ways a very special place.
Eatonville is as independent, wealthy and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he does not know what he misses."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidacy, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about racial relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
“We’re very keen on how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a town resident and community member of the city’s oldest church.
It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It’s no surprise that the locals are both proud and on guard.
And the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in language, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Freaky as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Away from the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always cares about, although he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and whatever fits into hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
“Zora described things as they were,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men singing songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, “Some people didn’t like it.”
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to the city brewed, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy chevrolet, smoking and dressed in pants, in a city that even today imagines something about her venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he rocked in his chair, on a back-facing terrace overlooking the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no major commemoration, no public readings on a grand scale.
“I don’t think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turnaround came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community’s slow two-lane main road.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed the Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
“At that time, a bunch of white boys often came and threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away,” said Mr. Franklin.
“There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.”
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to enforce integration by calling its decision in Brown's case against the school council "insulting rather than respecting my race."
Residents nowadays say that although the lifting of racial segregation was positive in some ways, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
“Black children were used to being hugged — I remember — they hugged their teacher in the morning and hugged their teacher in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit Eatonville Community Protection Group.
This could be maintained until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped to make room for more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors, and artists who overcame prejudices, just as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, “How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out for Hurston's nameless tomb and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-promised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found on the bookshelves, and made it again a part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway revived the city, accelerated the whole with top speed, aroused genuine citizen pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
More and more people came along, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to reappraise the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a peculiarity in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its meaning are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, prior permission is required and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men at fieldwork - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a brave, confident teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew larger, an increased degree of home pride was born.
Above all, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better, and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed as any other race and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, which he says might need some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people who only pass through here will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” Alondra Kenon said on a Sunday after church.
“But if you actually stop and look at your history for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, we speak fluent financial Latin.
At first glance nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspaper stands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York City, have the worst day of horror every day since the stock market crash of 1929.
The suppliers still push the metal tea carts along sidewalks with loud rattles and carry trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still swirl around between apartments, as human packed animals loaded with around 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bag on the sidewalk food stalls and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 and 7 pm.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon due to all the world’s ending rumours, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my compulsory course on the quiet late afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people standing in line.
Not at the cash desk to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask about the way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, as I later learned from Starr, my "personal banker with license," were queues for the same reason as me.
However, unlike me, they had already taken their savings from smaller banks, to places from which they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silent and quietly bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into bankruptcy management and when last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns savings assets worth $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
In fear of another collapse, the office and shop workers who stood in front of me brought their bars to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Very normal New Yorkers have acquired flowing financial Latin in recent weeks.
A woman who was on the phone in my main Chinese supermarket referred with so much acquaintance to Lehman Brothers, the bankruptcy bank, and their fattened-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has departed from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my grocery delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to take any more risks."
Muslim tombs disgraced during landslide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, are taking part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of being tombshed at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend when extreme right-wing parties recorded significant gains in the country’s parliamentary elections.
On the night of Friday morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an organized action, according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to conceal the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shaken” by the news of the tomb contempt that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan came to an end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the vote, advocated a strict anti-immigrant law in their campaign and some of their voting was criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, which won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas and even expressed his dislike of foods commonly associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets on the grounds that these are political symbols of the continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election that indicate that the extreme right is the politically strongest bloc in the country suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been legally banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted a foreign travel ban last Thursday after they presented evidence of Glitter’s pretrial convictions for sexual abuse of children to judges.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court said: "On Thursday, September 25, the Kent Police at Ashford District Court requested permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain by March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present.”
As required by the registry of sex offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter’s possible residence in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent’s police unit said: “The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.”
“Our view is that it is easier to control someone in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks.”
“It is the utmost concern of the Kent police to protect the residents of Kent and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to fly to London.
But he said he was not comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Lastly, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in 1999 for 4 months in the UK for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
<0x60>I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find a gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expressive strength of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project <0x60>Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer depicts a number of stage stage stage performances with singers, dancers and guitarists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month program, <0x60>reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing from day to day', explains the artist and makes it clear that <0x60>Flamenco-people' <0x60>anyone can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that it is not typical images of the artist on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What interested me was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera.
Inspired by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer set out on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the available material, images were created that resemble classic photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the picture, giving the picture the modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands Flamenco: <0x60>Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the next time.
Famous flamenco personalities including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as <0x60>portraits of the veterans of sport' (<0x60>SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the <0x60>Flamenco-people' project are different, the photographer gives to <0x60>I really like to photograph people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
In the field of photography, I think portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or come across people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of portraits of today’s flamenco, entitled <0x60>Flamenco-people', is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing about are ‘a foolishness’.
He doesn’t know where the novel’s story takes place and what it is all about, but Mario Vargas Llosa perseveringly tries to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, during his attendance at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is dealing with is “a foolishness” and “everything points out that he wouldn’t have to write the novel.”
“If I were prudent, I wouldn’t have done it, but I’ll do it and hope to finish the novel at some point,” he concluded his participation in the festival, where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of <0x60>La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival and to whom most of the attendees gave their voice, is compared to the old edition of <0x60>Our mutual friend' and can be seen at the Theater Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had <0x60>influenced' an audience before him, which realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose from <0x60>extraordinary adventure', from <0x60>pleasure of reading', and from <0x60>interesting' he writes how to experience his work and how to experience his own.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that there is ‘no way’ to measure, and how one can know whether books change life, ‘but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,’ stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it produces the ‘effects’ of each other, and still asks people to be more responsible.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play with: bullfighting festivals partly fell out.
After the announced bullfighters determined that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the feast in Pozoblanco was to be concluded, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, the organizer, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the feast of unstable weather was suspended, which is why two out of three celebrations could not be held.
On Saturday it rained, so the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadores group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfighting arena.
There was a celebration only on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and one ear of the bull, which he had achieved more by galloping than by his bullfighting.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, most of the audience responded with buh-calls in his second fight.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two policemen called on the drivers of the car to stop, whereupon they fled.
It looked like they wouldn’t have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police pursued her and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., as reported by the Basque State Ministry of the Interior.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when traffic police officers in the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the pursuit until the car stopped at the edge after a few kilometers. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee over a highway to a forest area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with bundles of hashish, which were later directed for accurate laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles to other police departments.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was <0x60>double', so that it did not match the license plate given on the car papers, which is why an additional arrest was made for forging official documents.
Police in the city of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A.J., who was arrested, was taken to a police station for interrogation and will be presented to the detainee in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for her role as Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness watched her attempt to escape from her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, a California traffic police spokesman told People magazine.
The witness told us in detail that Locklear “punched a gas pedal after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.”
A little later, the witness, who the actress probably didn’t realize at first, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby road and getting out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'fear of living for Locklears'.
When the police raid came, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street, blocking traffic.
“She seemed to be unorientated,” so they took the police officers to a special drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the very first moment. <0x60>Following the first observations of the officials, we believe Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and taken to a local detention center around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after treatment for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Federation of the United Left be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and Member of the United Left, today assured that the regional association for education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former city council for youth and sport of the city hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
“In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it,” Llamazares pointed out the way the party has to deal with the one who is so far a city councillor in Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of <0x60>transparency' in the possible investigations of the violations of the rules that Silva could have begun: <0x60>The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education “has a strict ethical code for all public offices”.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo': Hero Book by Garci
Inspired by <0x60>Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' presents the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros invested in filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to <0x60>present a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the actors.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and later on the station Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assured that thanks to this shooting his <0x60>childhood dream' was fulfilled. This was due to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him from the Autonomous Community of Madrid to shoot a memorial film for the second century celebration on 2 November in Madrid. Especially because the story took the basis of the <0x60>Epi'Epi'
The total contribution of 15 million made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming, Garci added, offers the <0x60>unique possibility' with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing the image of <0x60>confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been put back by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand the VII.
However, the Cineast regrets that one could not count with the financing as in <0x60>Alatriste' or <0x60>Los fantasmos de Goya' (twice as high as in <0x60>Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in <0x60>Volver a empretar', has been involved by his ordinary way of working: he stood on the stage to the actors with whom you have to rehearse first before you start filming and for those who had not done casting, he appeared to be <0x60> humiliating' and respectful to know what to do in the cinema, <0x60>a part of the profession of the director'.
Many actors he encounters in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (one of which he won), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither <0x60>Sangre de mayo', nor <0x60>Siete mesas de bilar fran<0xC3><0xA7>ais' and finally not the selected film <0x60>Los girasoles' blindos.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for offspring, later you realize it’s just for prosperity, and now you’re satisfied if you’ve produced another movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first women fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free movement of women.
Isabel Bayón fascinated the life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe during the period between the wars.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this role, which seemed impossible to me.”
“We are not trying to tell about her life, but to preserve her spirit,” said the flamenco dancer.
Her dance backgrounds helped me a lot in flamenco.
“The Dance of the Butterfly” seemed to me like Guajira, or “The Dance of the Snake” like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I’ve been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area,” she says.
The production expects two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel in one of her performances, as he did in <0x60>La puerta opena'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work together with one of her ex-students.
<0x60>Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.”
The production also counts on musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he <0x60>retakes the role of the accompanist of the artists, who were in divas.
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain epoch and whose works no one can appreciate anymore and therefore even less," Bayón says.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theater.
The publication of the book <0x60>Diario de un poeta newly married' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of <0x60>Diario de un poeta pascasado' at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, to celebrate the <0x60>Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008) the goal of the Jubile.
Thus, the <0x60>triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum by Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition <0x60>Juan Ramón Jiménez: <0x60>Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in New York in May and the international venue.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of <0x60>Diario de un poeta pascasado', edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The United States can imagine itself badly without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "sensation reporter," and from the then-ruling notion of American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his intriguing notion and followed her.
Look what it cost to give him an Oscar.
When he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow to everyone.
“What one feels sometimes is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford, weeping, “my life and my country were the greatest oddities of his life.”
No one was afraid of ridiculing or exaggerating themselves.
As the 'father' of cinema and homeland, he died at a sad moment when fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market prevails, when the depressed self-esteem of Americans in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity is.
If, in this difficult time, few people remain without virtue to be admired, you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered, like various losses, both profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and founded in honor of his son from the first marriage that died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
This is all a gift to the country where it took a lot of effort to stand up against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of amazement strikes high above Hollywood without regard for nationalities or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man has died, but the entire era.
English film director and Oscar winner Sam Mendes said working with Newman was no more or no less than the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“The greatest of us all has left us,” confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dare to try to live today as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high standards of righteousness, a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there is someone who tries, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who he was faithful to, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
“Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?” he joked often himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud of any of those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are poor.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, ‘Are we prepared for it?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it is not true!
It was called the perfect road, and in my opinion it was the worst road with everything on it.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you would consider the review and I could check it out, something like that would clearly not have gone through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pickup, which allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chips to avoid traffic jams on the road).
Well, I don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that is to go there only for the sake of it) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The t-shirt was only in size <0x60>S' (a second nonsense because I need size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
Well, things like this are a little bit compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks lying in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
In addition, in these 40 minutes of waiting it looked like rain, so that it was tempted to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think some 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow and some like me will not even appear in time for classification because of this chip I got, I can already think that the output was misstempeld.
Of course, if I were asked for a perfect road, I would never think of that road.
So I think we will dream for a long time of a city well prepared for the Olympics.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, that's a route planner listening to the entertainment on the company's campus).
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also classify those present after the conversations into the groups.
In the presentation video, the receptionist notices a third person, but she understands that that person is not a member of the group leading her conversation, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and replies that she will listen soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if computers were equipped with the most necessary equipment, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added one or the other function and <0x60>extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrom appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step in competing with Windows.
Many have pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work simultaneously.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law something.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of his ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, but more to the web browser.
The computer only starts to run Firefox, Explorer or Chromium and every day we spend more time surfing than in the surroundings of the <0x60>window'.
What is half of existing applications in the computer for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, without a doubt. I give a small example of it.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the soft drink machine is attached a sign: <0x60>Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used to search the web.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso owned it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in <0x60>Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in <0x60>The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to count the countless Stars appearances, we can draw back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and tailored.
The English-speaking people call it <0x60>tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles outperforms all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle <0x60>Marcel'. The legend tells that the creation of the name is associated with sport and stems from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
<0x60>La Marcel' outperforms everyone due to its excellent cotton, due to its distinctive unisex cut and is distinguished by a small Belgian flag (rarely recognizable) that have these T-shirts as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of <0x60>tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Pants, Striped T-Shirts, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very unfortunate to use them as underwear.
They are very charming.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite, but full of joy in life.
Currently, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris during the promotion of the company Mango, relocating her residence there and also makes the presentation of the most important prizes in fashion, sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I attended the presentation of the second edition of <0x60>Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner to honor Valentino.
A very intensive working time that is exciting at the same time.
You are working for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both of me are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dress up, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you are a very versatile woman, aren’t you?
I think so, but after all, everything comes together in one and these areas have a lot in common.
Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been thrilled with clothes; I’ve always wanted to go to my grandmother to roam my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in classes and rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, have you not fallen into a crisis?
Oh, what?
I feel better than ever when I was 30 years old.
I find that the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I’m not afraid of my biological clock.
I did the things I wanted to do since I was little and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
I have known for a long time that I will become a mother because my body demands it, and I also want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss it.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
I will convey great feelings of happiness to my child and educate him with a lot of love.
Regarding film art, you keep in mind the works that you have participated in and that were filmed last year.
That’s exactly how it is and I really want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want everything at once, which, of course, cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that <0x60>La last hora' and <0x60>En busca de la tomb de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A couple of days ago, you showed up on the walk with Naomi Campbell, right?
All right, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the climb to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization <0x60>Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our collection for Mango were auctioned to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
A lot of things are being told about them, and I, as the one who knows them, would tell you they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a stand, I will.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Drivers who may fall back due to the alcohol level will need to install the <0x60>Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol levels, install in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunk state. If he is alcoholic, then the car does not jump.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General's Office, which says it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to rehabilitate the driver, which is why he gets a course for retraining traffic behavior.
In addition to the Attorney General’s Office, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Safety of Automobiles will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75 percent of drivers who were shown under the influence of alcohol more than once regained control.
The ‘alcolock’ would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents car start when the driver has done an alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by the one who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of rule violations in the first year after their introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate their implementation, a lawful reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is called for, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still not available in the Spanish markets, in any store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, and this has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without peep-toes
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the scheduled time, next to the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed, with the Prince and Princess of Asturias traveling.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced them to use their hand as a parasol to see the royal couple stepping out of the plane.
Directly at the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A couple of hours before I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the prince and princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very well, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time. You're from here or something.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, well, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, including the military protection of 27 soldiers of the Navy who give honor salvo.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hairs blown by the wind, without ordinary peep-toes, may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers where the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican television reporter is waiting for them, who likes to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no substantially excellent fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition <0x60>el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and internationally increase young fashion talent.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300,000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the showcase of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company’s second largest business in Europe and was recently opened, with a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is located in London.
There have been so many events that one would like to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury presidency at the competition. It all ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with a heavy heart that was broken by pain because his brother died recently, broke up. He put on the suit from the fashion house and took on some ELAH jewelry that was breathtaking. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, greeted the guests and was such a cavalier that he ended up with the Baron of Red Shield without jackets, for jackets they borrowed from the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, rushed to the shop and had a trousers and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet rehearsals, so she's got in excitement, remembered a style of old times, grabbed a bar
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the cell phone.
The next morning we were pleased with the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own bedding and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, in advance asked to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, so is life.
1001 Advice against stress
There is not a thousand, but one more way to forget about chaotic, fast-paced everyday life.
And even if there are few, they are all collected in a book that tells you how to relax. The book comes to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment if it rings at 7 a.m., but the notion of getting back into the hectic rhythm that demands current life seems even worse.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the full list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called <0x60>1001 ways to relax' and so the tranquility that the book conveys comes into the bookstores of the publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to attain tranquility in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such a belief.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance in the body and stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit on the couch, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children speak at night
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell us what happened the day before, but the children who talk in their sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it does not matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this appearance.
Often, connections with other phenomena in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers, or it may be quite the opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult with a specialist to check for a problem that causes anxiety and occurs in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple preventive measures:
Do not try to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and a little too wild.
For nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner calm.
This helps the child sleep calmly.
When speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear him out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if he is scared after a couple of apparitions, it is recommended to seek advice or find out what reason the child has for the fear.
When they understand what it says (which isn’t that usual), the child doesn’t put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information out.
This way you will not be able to achieve anything because when the child is asleep, he is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams of and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhäusern on the playing field is finally back on track for success.
Without much effort, the Yellow-Blacks achieved numerous goal chances and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers struggled to show their skill, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot was just past the corner, Illhäuser were supposed to dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded in alternatingly first fonder flick with a distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot to challenge the defence of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only let the lively Riahi at the top of the storm through.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two goals won by Riahi and Temporary, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, which was exactly right to accept a ball that had been repelled in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the Illegal scorer was not to be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, causing his teammates to continue playing inferior numbers.
However, Denmark could not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems with an illhaeusian eleven, who only retreated a little to <0x60>compress' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, when the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
Given the determined stance of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to meet Tuesday morning in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit', and hoped that he would come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President’s visit will take place at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee, established by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in diesel prices, which has reached a record value of an average of over 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée Palace press spokesman David Martinon, “the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to ensure the employment conditions and pay of seafarers.”
Sarkozy is expected with determination from the fishermen.
Tuesday morning they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le did not cease.
The Quiberon peninsula was delimited with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning from early morning tyres and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish cutters did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique resolved the blockade of the major total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting on Wednesday in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec Crisis Committee must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give in at any point' and 'they will not go to Paris', proclaimed for example Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died at the age of 83 from cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes said goodbye to the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer upholds its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the impending recession, to be a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is delivering 215 aircraft delivered in 2008, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider distributing more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially backed by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering divesting more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it was charged.
AIG is willing to steer the sale of much of its business, beyond its international life insurance and pensions in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met Sunday evening to verify possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained at the AIG.
Among the assets that AIG would potentially separate from include its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and private equity investments, FT said.
No final decision has been taken in respect of these sales, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as quickly as possible in order to repay the loans over $85 billion it has been granted by the Federal Reserve, including at the risk that the U.S. authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the Session Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to rescue the banks, a historic fall in prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nassday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As for the points, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of September 11.
According to the final depreciation figures, the Nasstag index, mainly related to technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the plan to rescue the banks, which was to restore some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been slammed at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, MEPs denied Finance Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“Here is a bad picture being circulated that represents Congress as unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
‘This shows how much the market counted on this plan,’ she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days will ‘be too late’.
“If the project is actually doomed to fail, it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, chief economic officer at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, stressing the feeling of extreme urgency even more, “that every day that goes by brings the ruin of a financial enterprise” in the United States.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, U.S. authorities planned to buy the banking business of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures for banks in the UK, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” the analyst added to FTN Financial.
The market for basic necessities has grown strongly.
Revenues of the state treasury within ten years fell Friday night from 3.632% to 3.827%, and revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who came out as the winners, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, both Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this television duel, which was to be followed by one-third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, although quite attractive, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to stop his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday that says Obama is five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
Among the still undecided voters, i.e. those that matter now, Obama emerged as the winner with 39% from the polls, while according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to put his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, clearly underlining the 'naiveness' of his opponent on these issues which formed the center of this first television duel.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he stressed several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
A point of attack that has been preached since yesterday in the Republican election commercials.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and accurately, without letting himself be confused.
He highlighted his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, Obama has,” a Democratic election ad campaigner said this weekend, accusing Republicans of failing to grasp the full extent of the crisis that lies on the “American off the street.”
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in a rainy election in North Carolina.
He didn't even mention the words 'middle-sized' or 'workers'. ' The financial crisis gives Obama a clear advantage, which Americans consider best suited to saving the economy even at the edge of the abyss.
“Next week could be a turning point,” influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Having re-emphasized that he would probably even manage to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously eschewed the questions raised by the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial market rescue plan, which was passed last night by Congress and is extremely unpopular with the people.
“Did you notice that an election was held in Minsk?”
Youth and opposition demonstrators demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday evening since the closure of the election venues in Minsk’s market square to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: <0x60>The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they didn’t vote at all: ‘What good is that if they do what they want with my voice,’ says one teenager.
They do not believe that the regime, which showed itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turnaround.
The sanctions, including the non-issuance of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the icebreaking of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
"We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the count," regretted Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us it is the executive.
When opposition deputies enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcast time on television, meetings in the regions, and legislative proposals.”
The opposition is therefore guilty of meddling in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, will not recognize the election as valid.
She stresses that voter turnout figures seem too high, and that expanding the vote in advance (26% of Minsk voters) paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Did you notice that an election took place?” asks the leader of social democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those most likely to match the government’s ideas.”
The silence of the night lowers again over the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - From the blood that was safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be pleased as Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
Above all, it has regained the trust of the public, which had been severely shaken by the blood contamination scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As it is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood donation service were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the light of this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada initiated a public inquiry, led by Judge Horace Krever, in February 1994, aimed at shedding light on the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and drawing up guidelines to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to issue his report, several provinces at the time set up a committee whose goal was to develop a new system for managing blood cans in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
“In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started working, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood canning system in Quebec,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
“Through the tremendous efforts to improve the safety of blood cans and by working in this field over the following years, we have regained the public confidence,” she says, before proudly stressing that nearly 94% of Quebec’s population had confidence in Hema-Quebec in early 2008.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on September 28, 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of cattle insanity in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since the foundation of 1998.
“And we didn’t have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which exclusion measures are applied when you do not know this and when a disease progresses slowly, as is evidently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, manifested by degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was proven without any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied is quite meaningful.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which allow the detection of the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NSTs made it possible to shorten the incubation time that occurs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and could not be detected, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, that means that you would have to distribute 12 million cans of blood before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preserves each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs in which HIV was transmitted through a blood preserve.
I think you can feel comfortable nowadays when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore health," says the chief executive of Hema-Quebec.
“Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogens can get into the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We need to monitor continuously,” Dr. Décary continues, before emphasizing that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies in addition to a safe supply.
“Demand is rising as the population ages.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also affects the blood donor network, which on average only comprises 3% of Quebec’s population eligible for blood donation.
Any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is widespread are excluded from blood donation for a year.
“With these 3%, we manage to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you need to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but especially to keep them and make them become regular donors.
“Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour giving blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only preserved blood, but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public umbilical cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, there is blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand a year.
“We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,” Dr. Décary continues, describing this program of umbilical cord blood loss as very popular.
‘Many mothers are convinced they don’t have access to it,’ because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal's Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second and decide the quarter-final game at the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the USL's first league playoff games.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the Montreal team.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the Sounders.
Let’s remember that in the first game of the pre-and-return series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle, scored a 2-1 loss.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night, Thunder was able to make up for a 3-1 deficit in the Minnesota rematch by a 4-3 victory, but the Whitecaps still moved into the semi-final with a total score ratio of 5-4.
Impact will probably face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Florida panthers with a storm fire, resulting in a 3-2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the tricolors in six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the entire shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” warned the Russian.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.”
“He was too fixated on it in the first half,” Guy Carbonneau said.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.”
Charest relies on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out launching elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected in today’s partial election.
‘Move the course of our last great border to the north’: This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented visually yesterday at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in <0x60>Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great funds as during the election period.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to rule out holding the elections this autumn, even though he said that his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area' that provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speeches lately, the opening of the North – the northern area at 49th latitude – had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was “a jewel with tremendous potential,” but gave no date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At the very most, some perspectives on what more could be worked on: mainly on water energy, forestry, but especially the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charest's enumeration, the North possesses <0x60>nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This <0x60>area twice the size of France' <0x60>is close to us, is in Quebec.
It is not only close to us, it is within us," he stressed, as to show clearly that he is seeking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it is our future,” he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always called for, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises I will retake this stance on behalf of the government," he said.
Moreover, “with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he explained, talking about the Northwest Passage, which will be feasible throughout the year due to ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist MP from Ungava) have already begun discussions in some thirty communities.
A committee of ministers headed by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) occupies an important place, has started the work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large meeting, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where 'one will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will, moreover, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it were a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have reconsidered to turn the challenges into new growth and development channels.
This was, by the way, one of the repeatedly raised themes of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s takeover of the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the rename of the Beauharnois power plant to the Adélard Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” Charest said.
He referred to another conservative project this time, the Roads to the North program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr Charest stresses that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
“That remains among us, but I intend to be there,” he entrusted to his party members, which sparked those applause storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly no elections in 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him by law.
However, he stresses that his schedule is full, mainly because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly this weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially of "constitutional" objectives, which were readily adopted: the PLQ demands in particular the recognition of the "peculiarity of Quebec" in the constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to veto the decisions made in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the Plan Nord were accepted with skepticism.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has re-emphasized the development policy of the North of Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refrained from applying it.
If she had done so, “we would have gone a long way today,” Ms. Marois said alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ has spoken out to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this will not just be a big show," party leader Sébastien Proulx said in a statement on behalf of Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A disgraced country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (what an irony) in the Harper cabinet, was the one who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an endless struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration for covering it with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as she does about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one of all the affected countries that has not brought home its compatriot who was trapped in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things he was accused of happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and leaves a child soldier to vegetate under inhumane conditions.
The only one who descends to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the defendant.
Let’s remember that above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers’ Association are calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he gets a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that also closes its eyes to torture: it does not interest them that a young adult, after so many years of torment, will surely be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing a treacherous circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, this word which Harper constantly carries before him like a flag, and which sounds so meaningless from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morality whatsoever: you can arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, entirely in accordance with the goodwill of a head of government who to this day is only supported by the minority (may he belong entirely to the minority after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they can find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has divested itself of what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine.
This confirms, and pursues an Orwellian logic, that the world’s largest gold mining company sought a defamation lawsuit of over six million against three authors and a small resourceless publishing house, with the aim of opening a ‘transparent public debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of defamation lawsuits, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter what the trial ends, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is, moreover, often to ruin the defenders in order to enforce a consensual settlement that silences the other side and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to public opinion.
In contrast, what is commonplace in many of the countries where Barrick works gold, debates in Canada are usually held by exchanging ideas rather than by sticking.
It would have been enough, therefore, if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams that could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes away the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time and yet disregard the opinions of this public?
Apparently this word in the world of the Vice-President encompasses only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanders have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public supporting the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so primarily because they reject the brutal stance of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the ‘public debate’, Barrick Gold has just made a demand to the authors of Noir Canada that they no longer use that term...).
Aside from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and truth-finding that is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss issues that do not please the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to deal with debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take action to limit this kind of unjustified lawsuit.
Wall Street Rescue Action - Democrats and Republicans Understand
The Bush administration and its congressional leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be adopted by the two chambers of Congress.
The main contents are: better control of MEPs on the practical implementation of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new orders to curb the number of houses seized due to arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies.
U.S. Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, House of Representatives President Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative Senator Judd Gregg, who was present at the negotiations, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,” Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street price crisis,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, the chaos and the riots in Americans’ daily lives will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, out of fear of the impact that a further failure would have had on investors’ mood.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part late in the negotiations, were more likely to be proponents of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions for agreement, especially those that would allow the owners to keep their homes, and those that concern the salaries of the executives of the companies rescued by the state.
When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons, that is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television channels.
When asked on another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied, “I would like to know the details first, but I hope it will.
“The guiding principles I have read [show] that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan is geared towards using taxpayers’ money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally ended in a freezing of financial power and ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed last week’s first attempt at agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain “toxic” assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, it is believed that they have escaped the dead end.
In order to round off the perspectives for everyone in Congress, an order has also been added that if the government were to make losses within five years of this program, it could then levy new taxes to recover its capital used.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion has to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that will bring dividends to it in the event of profits, and which will be able to sell it again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the foreclosure proceedings concerning the dwellings tied to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also to set deadlines for repayment and severance payments paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it already today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, there were more votes against this plan yesterday, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
“Washington obviously doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber’s Financial Commission, told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the ones that are asking taxpayers to checkout.”
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a congressional group called the Caucus of Skeptics, puts things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to inform us: we ask the Congress not to be pressured, and to carefully consider what course to take,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we were once again shown that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who is in great difficulty since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to the high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
To compensate, we have the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households value now that uncertain times are announcing.”
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank that was in distress by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans to Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over $41 billion ($75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the British bank’s branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalized by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trumpet, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity and obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that brings forth the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great continuous runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from the consequences of lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his spectacle, surely even more fragile, but just as much an apostle of freedom and the breaking up of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
Its European roots should be one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because it reflected a whole country that was in love with self-made man, the fighter who was wounded in the Pacific War, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before having success in theater, television and soon in the cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who was second in the Mans 24-hour race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, even though he lived in a flagship relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and supersensitive star to the glamour of the show business disappear, whose puzzles you will never completely solve.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman moved movie lovers to Taumel this weekend, while all of his big roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change passes with him.
Then the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes back to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Sheet Metal Roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) is awakened to his sensitive Lord Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all of her promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, was re-reprised after his death and made the Newman famous in 1956.
This sympathetic crook in the outstanding The Sting, which was awarded the Oscar for best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's wonderful The Hustler (1961),
That face through the ages, that was him.
Still him.
In his résumé, epochs are united.
Young people know him mostly from George Roy Hill's cult film Slap Shot (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him back in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends who retired early enough from the film world, Newman was supposed to stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his glory and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to <0x60>underplaying' when he judged his too expressive performances.
The job was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles only flew for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, fiends or desperate, with whose perfect depiction he reflected his gliding and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitiveness.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the 1968 novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead, drew a fine-minded portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of tenderness and sadness.
At the flood of honors poured out yesterday over Newman, his close friend and former weapon companion Robert Redford (who had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection, and independent cinema, an opponent of the drifting Hollywood, goes there.
We have probably often seen it standing on our feet in bowls full of vinaigrettes, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this was thought to be quite tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
Nevertheless, the profits from his revenues flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these phrases: “Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of supplement &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations begin in the criminal trial against János’s charge and his accomplices.
The defendants are accused in particular of involvement in organised crime, gross negligence and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the funds leased from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services rendered were often documented with fake invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have flowed partly into the cash registers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private cash registers of individuals.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented when the tender funds were received, and the clubs are also said to have failed to fulfil their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were counterfeit.
The billing blocks were bought at the Józsefváros market and the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on that round trip north of Lake Plattensee, which was sent to István Lados by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find guesthouses and restaurants.
He demanded invoices on the consumptions in order to be able to issue later invoices based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-administration of Budapest.
Most of these invoices are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, has been responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "Exploration Tour" was a beer bar.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by surcharge and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the company states that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, also had serious errors in form and content.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, according to the bill 130 guests have been staying.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was apparently also without limits when it came to the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company in whose accounting documents of the clients Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá do not appear at all, according to the prosecution authority.
As CEO Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that these were fake documents when documents were presented to him by the prosecutor during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly placed on the stamp."
Aside from form errors, the fact that the facility is said to have housed one hundred people, after having a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to accommodate so many people, was also wrong.
It was also mentioned on the invoice food, the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The invoice counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they were targeting exclusively offers travel abroad, and thus they indicated Hungary travel on the cash payment invoice, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As the investigation revealed, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, since the company charges only 15 percent VAT instead of 25, in addition, the employees are issued exclusively by machine invoices, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake the “invoicers” had made was that in one case they had indicated “transport of goods” as a service provided, although this is not offered by the company specializing in investment consulting, the prosecutor’s office said.
Further form errors - incorrect invoice format, incorrect stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Szazazadi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeits.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managing directors claimed that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" is experienced by the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in dissolution at the time (2001) in fact, when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület is said to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore said that they did not issue the invoices themselves.
Deliberately Fake
The other group of accountants are individuals who were well aware that they would have to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation, in the amount of about HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with surcharge and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have failed to provide the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület associations with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million.
However, there was also little payment, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issuance, which the persons concerned, however, forgot to note in their documents.
The third group of depositors includes persons who are directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest, but not found there.
The company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components in the period from October to December 2005, totalling about 18 million HUF.
According to the investigating authority, the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, has acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov confessed to having issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alapítvány and to having collected their equivalents themselves.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
In reality, however, none of these companies were active, which was, according to the accused, due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was tasked with preparing the company’s foundation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the surcharge, such as to Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices totalling HUF 14.2 million on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor’s office estimates that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but these amounts have been used in an alienated way.
To cover this up, they submitted five fictitious invoices from the Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
By the way, these invoices were secured during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some defendants now expect a confession on the procedure of counterfeiting, as they have already been filed before the prosecutor.
A sensation could be if the main defendant, János, decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the reparation of the majority of the damage incurred of HUF 50 million, and whether the surcharge in return is willing to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the supplement now plays the "injured" after his requests for mitigation of detention and house arrest had come to deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage with economic offences and have not remunerated them are on their own, or at least under house arrest, surcharge remains denied this possibility.
The psychology of overbidding - or why we're willing to pay more
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the filed.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to beat themselves in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have attempted to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was to play the lottery, while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the opponent's overbidding plays a major role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to underpin their thesis, the economists in the research group have additionally carried out research to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they emerged as winners from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was only that the emphasis on one was on winning, while on the other was on losing.
As evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "against losing" group were willing to take higher stakes than those in the control or the "win" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have justified the behaviors observed at auctions so far only with the joy of winning, or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated at one hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in the case of hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in the case of hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretion or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against the viruses A and B, in any case, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after consuming the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, the jaundice appears on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes bright, the urine becomes dark, and recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Around 1 million people worldwide die each year from the far more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people are on drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups where this disease is more common: those who underwent blood transfusions before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
Currently, the number of people suffering from chronic hepatitis C is estimated to be 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease is already detectable during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the GP at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognized in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby banning the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, the first World Hepatitis Day to be hosted by patient representatives worldwide in 2004.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic liver infection caused by viruses, its emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
Recent research shows that religious faith acts as a kind of “pain remedy” that has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it investigated the extent to which belief in God influences human pain, the British newspaper "Telegraph" reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electroshocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
A brain scan technology even proved that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from different departments of the university participated.
During the experiment, the subjects were attached to the left hand with a sparkling device, which gave off the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke some kind of religious trance among the believers, while selecting da Vinci’s picture because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as reassuring.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages, while looking at either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt "safe" at the sight of the Mother of God as if they were "concerned" and felt "rest and peace".
While looking at the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that you could create similar effects with other, strongly acting images, even among atheists, you just need to find the corresponding photo.
“We need to find an image that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing the faith should change our personality, and so does it in many cases,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, the only question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth birthday, Google is right to say that it can be found in people’s pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: it knows where people spent their holidays, which specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the CEOs of Google.
In the direction of skeptics plagued by Orwell’s horror visions, he points out that they would just overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal of “arranging all the information in the world.”
Schmidt said that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of information gathering.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?", but software programs were not yet able to do so because they did not know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be recorded, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save their own search history and later rely on it so that the hits can be generated much more accurately later, and on the same logic are also the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends customized products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in case of data abuse - "When you look at what I'm doing" - some are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company that is fearful, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the rebellion against the power that many internet users encounter.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but are also passed on to third parties in the event of such a transaction, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google handed over information to the Brazilian government collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophilias.
However, users concerned about personal rights were able to breathe in May, when Google successfully tried the FBI together with the civil rights organization EFF: accordingly, Google can not be forced in the future with any point of the constitution to release information to the FBI on a secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, however, it was deprived of the list of individual users, respectively their web and search terms list for two months retroactively.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: Those who reluctantly release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google services, are scourging the company with the outrage due to the conservative companies.
Meanwhile, the American “geek culture” that is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users sees the next generation of “cool entrepreneurs” in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that unlike Microsoft, Google does not require its users identification codes, and provides its services for free, making an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem far more attractive, youthful and cool than the software giant’s official practices.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet sharp - a relationship that has come to the fore in particular in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing more than collaboration, that is, the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teenager can simultaneously manage his profile on multiple community portals - from Facebook to Xanga, he can connect them through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually embed all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that represent the latest photo galleries automatically on Flicktets or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases proves: When looking at the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is fired because he is only too honest about his anger about the management of the company - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
The person who leads an online life is what he reveals of himself - that is how one could in fact formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, can do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but deliberately leaves no traces.
Many people do not deliberately register on community sites, so that they are not findable, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile of the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense’s advertising space threatens advertising agencies’ revenues, and the rapidly-introduced services are causing headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing opposing poles: for example, the Group management completely rejected a protest by employees, after the fees of the company’s own kindergarten were doubled, in addition, the management said that the repeated feeding of employees was too costly. But all this mutes quite mildly against the idea that in 2006 Google went to the Chinese government, even in the face of a protest.
The internal regulation of the group is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could again turn a lot strongly: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning or archiving project is now completely assumed that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, the other are rather the problem of the system.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database already provides the next generation of sci-fi authors with the stuff - for example, "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian way a future in which a person becomes terrifyingly close thanks to data collected by Google.
Two Teenagers Help <0xC3><0x93>zd's Double Killer in Trace Elimination
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, police have now interrogated two young people suspected of helping to remove the traces, the spokesman for the Borsod Police Commission said on Tuesday.
The young people were confessed, they are currently being charged with aid.
According to the MTI news agency, two girls defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately murdering several people out of greed.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a 53-year-old a greater amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act long-handedly - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a gun hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Around EUR 200 million, or 5 billion Czech crowns, has been offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolevski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they were formerly excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is wholly owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, intends to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily "E15" the offer of the Poles contains the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the newspaper, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far offered offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kronor.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments on Tuesday devoted to the growing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers already spoke of “Second September 11”.
The global financial catastrophe we owe to the American president meant, for example, "La Repubblica" - the president had not even been able to get his own party behind the bill to bring some relief into the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “second 9/11.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
While Bush’s plan was not perfect, now, after the congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not have the political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, for example, the Geneva "day indicator".
Even though some states could still provide their banks with bailout packages and save the banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and even more banks are going bankrupt, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than 100 billion euros were paid out to weakening financial institutions, recalls the Viennese newspaper "Der Standard". Moreover, the newspaper continues, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers would now have to grab a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis, which is now sweeping over the old continents like a tsunami.
While the "savers" would not have to "weep" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to record in which case it would be reasonable to touch the money of the taxpayers in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the hummingbirds
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented, in which Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees to create new accident-preventing systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C-type biomimetic system, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, to support the development of a system that avoids collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the autorobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by rotating the tires around the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If it weren't, the autorobot couldn't respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Autorobot Project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they dodge other bees.
And this must happen in a fraction of a second.
However, the dodging, unlike the bees, can not be done up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the turnability of the matures.
While there are infinite possibilities for the bees to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotational movement, or the acceleration and deceleration, in the case of the autorobot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond to them accordingly.
It does not have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous maneuvers, so that it constantly takes only a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of instant collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could be the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately guiding the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to his destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the $700 billion bailout bill is available, which will be applied in several stages and is aimed at buying the banks’ bad loans.
In the first round, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local East Coast time, congressional MPs have passed after several days of debates on an agreement on the $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying that the agreement had to be put on paper.
Both presidential candidates – Barack Obama and John McCain – supported the compromise on the bailout package.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said the program will be effective, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about the rescue of Wall Street, but about tearing the rudder of the economy around.
The written version of the package was published even before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8am (Central European time Monday 2am), but did not trigger a high flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, first the House of Representatives votes on the 2008 bill to stabilize the economy, then the Senate is in turn.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy,” said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program, however, deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of lazy, borrowed securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion amount is to be spent, with $250 billion immediately available after Congress votes on the Cause as expected on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credited, bad securities, and the other $100 billion is to be decided by the President.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which also includes the president of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another congressional decision.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-loaded securities, or other "toxic" loans.
According to the Ministry’s officials, the purchase can take place both in an auction and directly.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program in which the Treasury guarantees the worrying funds and companies pay the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: “The law defines the means needed to provide up to $700 billion in emergency aid for the American financial system, whether it be for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, Paulson said.
The heads of the banks in trouble and now relying on state aid can, however, expect that their clearances, which are called in overseas slump "Golden Handshake", will be cut by the government.
Salary cuts will only occur in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance is helping each other.
The reduction essentially means that if the ministry purchases as part of an auction, so the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the outgoing bank head is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will engage aggressively to ensure that managerial salaries are not exaggerated.
The image also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions are only related to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts to manager salaries are regulated by law, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee.
The state gains ownership rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the rescued bank gets better.
The bill requires the president to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers can get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect from us, the plan won’t protect taxpayers’ money in any way, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were driven by the same people who were also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
According to the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose 0.1 percent compared to the previous month in August 2008 and 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008 and fell 3.9 per cent from the previous year's prices.
Due to domestic and export price changes, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have only slightly increased compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry have also risen only slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly for bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, for shoes prices rose by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials pushed prices for chemicals and production up significantly (1.6 percent).
Price decreases were recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 per cent), and wood processing (0.1 per cent).
Prices in papermaking, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the major domestic sales markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the gas price increase introduced on July 1.
Considering the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry year-on-year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4%).
In the metal-processing sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in food, beverage, and tobacco production was 11%.
A decrease in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
In the other manufacturing industries, the level of inflation was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
In the domestic sales market, the highest price increase in the asset sector was recorded in August (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose 0.3 percent, while they remained the same in the energy and processing sectors compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sector compared to the 2007 comparison period (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent was recorded, while in the asset sectors, a price reduction of 1.4 percent was recorded.
Industry export prices measured in Forint rose in August by 1.1 percent compared to the previous month, but declined by 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7% compared to the euro, the dollar by 7.1 percent, and compared to the August 2007 rate, it was 7.5% stronger compared to the euro, even 15.9% stronger than the dollar.
No more visa to the U.S. from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa accord will come into force on January 12, as the Foreign Minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, “it all now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or overseas control system will be introduced in a timely manner.”
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permits in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will present her with the Republic of Hungary’s “Middle Cross of Merit with Star,” and she also holds talks with Democrat Barack Obama’s foreign policy advisers and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, on Sunday pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the finance minister.
Congress and government officials announced after days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they have reached an agreement on the bank bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain – both claim to be better suited than their opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain's Hoch, which gave him the presentation of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, melted down at the same time.
At an election event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he supported with.
"We must act now, and be responsible ... - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are under threat," he said in front of 35,000 viewers.
He did not fail to call McCain’s economic visions “obsolete.”
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We’re all going to have a hard time pinching this ... but doing nothing is certainly no alternative.”
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as restricting clearances for top managers — something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
Nancy Pelosi, a spokeswoman for the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, only the voters within the camp became more confident - so comments "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch break is at the same time a problem for Christian democracy, as is the case for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU disaster did not come, but something ended on Sunday, which, however, was already quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Because already ten years ago, 1998, the CSU ended up at 47.7 percent and thus fell for the first time since the fifties to the fifty percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the much-cited Stoiber era.
Finally, the modernization carried out by the CSU in the federal state has destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time considerably estimated at the pace, but without impact the secularization, the educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain loyal to the CSU voters.
Modernisation is always accompanied by increased options, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and idiosyncratic.
It is striking that in the last few weeks the classical civic groups expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school degree such as a university degree.
The CSU’s support dropped to less than 40%.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders restrained in coalition issues" article on the chaotic domestic policy situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit themselves to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it’s all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders hardly let their cards look.
SPÖ CEO Werner Faymann reiterated his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very well possible - this is already the case in some federal states and in the social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP leader as vice chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, voters had opted out of the Bowl-Molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer has, however, reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tries to interfere in the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition, or into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally by the ÖVP.
BZÖ CEO Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
“To prevent red-black, we are ready to take government responsibility,” Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit on Equal Opportunities began in Paris, which will be hosted this year by the country of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union France.
In her speech to the plenary, Livia Járóka, Fidesz MEP of the European People’s Party, drew attention, in particular, to the segregation of education, as it is one of the most serious violations of rights against Roma children, and it is also the biggest obstacle to their need for applicability.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of Fidesz MEPs, Járóka has warned that, in addition to discrimination in job-seeking, Roma would be displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have a middle school education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can achieve a university degree."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education is a fundamental human right that would play a key role in the assertion of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
In the opinion of the MEPs, it is important that a broader circle - Roma and non-Roma - become aware of these connections.
The sooner a Roma pupil starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and sales tax they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - poor and segregated education must be discontinued" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the MEP explained, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of disintegration in the education sector, in order to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are correctly complied with.
“We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,” Járóka said.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom from discrimination at European as well as national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debate, no heads are rolling, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the only question is how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of vote will be decided on the last weekend of October at the Extraordinary Party Congress.
But the much scolded duo already made it clear that it does not want to stick on their armchairs.
They want to appease the angry faction and the party base, who demanded personal consequences one day after the “Bayerian tsunami” in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at his career peak - the Christian-Social Union still reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was a "alone director" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the determining force in the southern state that is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the internal party restructuring, the potential successor of Huber, Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which is conducting exploration discussions with the liberal FDP and the right-wing "Free Voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
It is ironic that with the list of "free voters" Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-stealing appearance first exploited the Huber-Beckstein duo to then mercilessly serve the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all its forces on stabilizing Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the threads out of the background, will play an active role. The former prime minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the "bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous remarks towards the CDU - in his view, the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed much to success at the national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint act of force, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor again after the German parliamentary elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment in the fiasco, believes that the loss of ground by the CSU will not have a negative impact on the big coalition in Berlin.
What is relatively, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result so far in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no opposition deputy was able to get into the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegal vote counting.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
De Legislature of the ten-million-inhabiting state has been without opposition for decades, yet the counterparty, assembled under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections, has earnestly hoped that Lukashenko, who in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would be re-elected in the presidential mandate for the fourth time.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically dependent on the import of natural gas from Russia thanks to the rising prices. For the easing of the price increases, even loans have been taken, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country, to the Russians. Against the background of expectations of the opposition there was the hope that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU.
The OECD’s election evaluation report, which emphasized positive movements rather than shortcomings such as the exclusion of one-third of opposition candidates from the elections, provided a temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD’s quick report criticized the campaign as early as Monday – so opposition officials are not expected to appear in the press – and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in counting the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free for example, and Minsk is even ready for minor confrontations with Moscow, continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is considered on paper as a federative state, the two territories have been independent for one month.
“We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one oppositionist into parliament".
The opposition is not planning to take protest measures in light of the results, but rather seeks to make the voters aware of the need for economic reform.
"We have a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in our way in distributing, but nevertheless I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones," Milinkevitch said, referring to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners is in agreement with the production of the Lukashenko regime, whose sole security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the 'social security' that is warning of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the deeds, not the words, so the absence of opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi, there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those who stamp and then drink coffee during working hours.
The new “Anti-Faulpelz Act” was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
"Durable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," Brunetta said.
“Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta once again underlines.
With the Palazzo Chigi the installation ends in all buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value."
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the secretary-general assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is no longer breakfast during working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
In Rome, the minister announced that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, which means that 60,000 more people are present at work per year".
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
"Over the last 8-10 years, their wage dynamics have been twice the size of the private sector and well above the inflation rate."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have come together to counter the Brunetta decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service profiles himself with numbers about lower absentees at work - so writes the Consumer Center - the people of the 'active lazy' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have come together to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree.”
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day, 2500 accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, data from the Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro confirm that the fatalities at work were around 1200.
These numbers prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as are caused by murder.
Today, in all the provinces of Italy, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will celebrate the 58th National Day for the Victims of Work Accidents, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the decisiveness of the issue of workplace prevention," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to preventing jobs, protecting injured workers, helping victims' families and raising public awareness".
"There has been an outrageous 'basta' on this; understandably in the case of tragedies that, in terms of their magnitude, provoke some vortices in the media and public sympathy, but everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely also a resource problem: there must be decisive investment in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in school settings by young people who feed on the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness; we must put in place and improve a legislative norm.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on occupational accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not preclude that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this 'positive tendency' to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you believe that basically not enough is done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting at school.”
"A further effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and raising awareness of public opinion.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli also spoke of the "progressive deterioration of protection for victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "abolition of the social system against which we are fighting in recent years".
"The aim is, therefore, to give back to the worker a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident does not depend on voluntary or random donations decided from time to time by a legislature."
Mp3-Player under Charge: Risk of Hearing Damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time using portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the EU’s Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) in a report released today in Brussels.
“It is clear from the report that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music on portable music devices for at least five years a week for more than an hour a day risk permanent hearing loss.”
"I'm worried that such a large number of teenagers, who usually put wearable music devices and mobile phones on high volumes, will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," Kuneva said.
"From the scientific findings - it is said by the European Union - there is a clear risk that urges rapid action.
What really matters is to raise consumers' awareness and make this information a common concern.
In light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists confirm that one is rightly concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other EU Member States and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could be caused by excessive noise.
These damages can be very limited by using solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise display.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that when users of portable music devices only listen to loud music for five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace have already been exceeded.
Those who cross this boundary risk a complete loss of hearing within five years.
That is 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the future of the capital"
We start today, it is supposed to be over in March, in June the balance sheet will be drawn up.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome, the Commission met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it", - emphasizes Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the city council and the municipal council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a major project for Rome.
Their task will be completed in March and the Commission will dissolve again, as such a project must have a fixed end point in time.
In June, the mayor announces, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Anyone who questions the competence of the Commission because it lacks its opinion of binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deal with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in view, in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
"This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will make us think, it will employ the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to allow our city a leap in quality - which it really needs - and to take a joint step into the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself to the current local borders, but will look much further", not only in terms of the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician who is very keen on being considered independent has written: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations with opposed Islam (and still does so today as a private person).
Attacks on Obama are getting more and more fierce, just as the elections are approaching.
A woman from Miami wrote on an internet site: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators.
Actually, however, these attacks don’t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: Only in the election booth will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been kept hidden until the last.
“Say what you want, then we’ll decide who we’re going to make our creeping for, whether it’s for Obama or for McCain.”
There are people here swearing: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now when the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistake did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority the weak point of Bush.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: In the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nonetheless, they were not really concerned about the general credibility of the information concerning those responsible.
They don’t feel as alone as they used to be.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are due to the reductions in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large public understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism today meets the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors in the press say that national journalism is on the wrong track.
In the local area, executives are even at 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine which direction the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are paving their way to the Internet, which is regarded by many as the "killer" of the press.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to joining the new technology in the hope that it "brings something good for journalism".
The biggest rift in American journalism today exists between newsroom editors and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at the local level only 23%.
Some think it has to do with “safety at work”.
The number of managers who fear losing their jobs within three years is 47% nationally.
Journalists are 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "writers", note d. red.) is always a topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and internet operators, employers provide as they like and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors receive very often very high wages, the editor on the other hand can sometimes get only 10,000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As far as the holidays are concerned, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become “sick” throughout the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUDGMENT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court in Rome, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent, who had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the course of the trial against him over the past week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such relocations (against which the prosecutor's office had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence of charges.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon had already revealed itself a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the White House’s $700 billion savings package: A large part of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s issue of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis is splitting the Republican party in the run, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives who are hostile to “those in Washington” and the financial world, and wins mostly in the southern and central states.
This part of the party owes its rise above all to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the US, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond will be affected by them.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events, which finally take shape under these new conditions and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline of the banking and financial institutions that have close ties to abroad and at the same time manage an immense amount of wealth of private households living in a single state.
This represents an immediate political problem for governments: namely, how to behave towards the families concerned, who are also an enormous mass of voters.
So the crisis appears economically global, politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism in itself seems to have fallen apart and lost its right to speak: the clear evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US can save itself in the economic situation without foreign aid.
And besides the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two conditions not to be overstated – under certain circumstances – to which no international organization or market will otherwise be able to resort in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the national-state element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a sector closely related to it: territoriality.
Paradoxically, when we were so convinced that we had long ago entered a networked whole realm, a realm of ever differentiated technologies, of the intangible, it is precisely now that we must suddenly determine how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
While they can all be transported from one place to the other in the world, they are still in the extreme connected to a closely enclosed piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, one who has such a territory is in advantage over another who lives in a harvestless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief insertion.
Whoever says politics, whoever says politics, whoever says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, even more disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of distance, all directed at a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
The conviction among large parts of the population seems thus to pave the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is always more foreign and conventional to the majority.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of the disempowerment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the immediate reversal of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the American party in Bavaria and the conservatives in Germany.
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value with regard to what is going on in the lower social strata of the West nowadays and from the financial crisis is still intensified and up to the overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a “rebellion of the masses”.
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that lets go up on walls
Defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which is now apparently almost at its destination.
Using an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of spaghetti tubes arranged in a stack,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests using different materials such as glass teflon and abrasive paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the ability to hold the feet of reptiles and at the same time "makes it easy to remove from the wall," said Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps, but the researchers are more likely to think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall into the field of space.
For now, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – including the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new kind of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that, like hair on a surface, cleans itself from dust, thereby maintaining perfect adhesion.
Drugs: Never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage when taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, since they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has repeatedly pointed out the risk of both packaged and fresh fruit juices in conjunction with drug intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again sounded the alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
The same agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago about the dangers of this mix, stressing to be careful what is being drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepane or metadon.
It’s not just Grapefruit – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the Universit<0xC3><0xA0> Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers who are thus free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still uncertainties, do not be shy to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the expert of the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to Paul Krugman for his analysis of trading patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more decisive for US history than the attacks.
A prediction that received not a little controversy in response and was presented to the economist even years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public eye," Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an “economist of great value”, but also a banaliser with a “very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the Bush administration’s excessive liberalism.”
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package is released
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presented to the public with some novelties: in addition to a revised and now more spartan designed initial menu, now a guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x has finally been achieved, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e the latest ISO format.
Eight others were also opposed to compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send via email, including the ability to import PDF files into graphic editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by multiple users, avoiding conflicts when changing; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a question to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently releasing various features of OpenOffice on the internet (on the cloud), while the definitive result is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, which follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the office.
However, free of charge can be a stimulus for the dissemination of the program in private households, so it is especially in the field of business, where OpenOffice could succeed the big throw: after all, various public administration institutions and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, for creating presentations as with Powerpoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of the more familiar Access; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded by already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Also Kohl tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens in the context of the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is third-class and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver to be tested positively on Cera, the third generation epo. Previously this was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses of cabbage blood samples are among those that have been done in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the matches confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epotest and also notified the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY RASSISTIC? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only received with reluctance.
Turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists, this is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the topic of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young, Burkina Faso-based Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he stole a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the “paradox of the North”: the northern regions are those where “the most integration and job opportunities” exist, yet “the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support of the Lega Nord is recorded.”
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not only this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the speedy expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for a cooperation between church and state to combat racism."
Students are victims of high rental prices of up to 900 euros per room
The student housing market has no crises.
According to the latest investigation by Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits, so many students lose their right to study because their families are unable to support them at this level," says the officials of the Sunia, Laura Mariani, "in these cities, the high demand on the part of the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized sublets.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices through a revision of the taxation.
A closer look at the investigation shows that in Milan a sleeping space in the Brianza district is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping space costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room costs 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping space in a double room.
Only slightly lower are the rents in the neighbourhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>.
Only those who dodge in outer districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a bed, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping area costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350 euros.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% above the average is demanded by foreign students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the great urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, in the long run means death for the one-room cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also bears the characteristics of a cultural crime.
It is like losing a friend with whom you have walked a street full of emotions, according to the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who earned him the Oscar and the Cannes Grand Prix 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a world well lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the tremendous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; most of them paid for the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This testifies to the fact that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "although it is useful that new structures also emerge, the first priority is to preserve the already existing, because closes a hall in the city, not all its regular customers are ready to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old.
And here still remains the lack of budget for the fund of the trade association: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
To maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed."
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears of the old cinemas, decided to protect them through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are also tax benefits for cinema operators and benefits for the public with regard to local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic-limited areas of the center and also to park at lower parking fees.
“It is a delightful initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “I hope that other cities will follow our example and also develop new concepts.
Certainly, we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to align against the superpower of multiplex rooms, because, after all, the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside not to have to see the dusty posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations of the anti-mafia authority of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew were also handcuffed: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the head of the clan, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at the time to a sum of 10 million euros in compensation.
"In disregard of any moral and legal norm," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations had decided to pay lawyer Piromalli funds for advisory activities."
“This made it possible for the mafia group – according to the judges – to officially invade the town halls and determine the policy of public administration.”
The President of the Calabrian Regional Committee Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encountering links of local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others, where such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who preserve a white vest."
This morning’s arrests follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the Piromalli clan was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also at the time due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 election.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipality council.
He accused Vice Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti of having invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges say in connection with this morning’s arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
A hearing action in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case has shown the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making the actions of the public administration identical with the interests of this clan.
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run up.
It is a non-drying source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface and only now do the big energy companies of the world seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is looking at and looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; not accidentally, these studies intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was forgotten, but now the environmental organisations and the rising oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be met by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to twice the current energy produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are also the currents and tides.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are now relying on marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said the spokesman of a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering the possibility of working with us.”
This is about acquiring an approval from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that oil is still being pumped by the United States in Alaska and that President Bush has only recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers speak of an increasing interest.
And technologies that can be improved.
Experts speak of a technology still in the making, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimensions and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, it requires technologies with far greater impact on the environment.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater pipes.
So far, there are four planned installations of this type, which are only awaiting state approval. Part of the energy obtained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, is already producing power for a department store and a parking lot using undersea turbines in New York’s East River.
The water movements during the tide drive the turbines, which feeds the generator due to the rotary movement that arises.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Recovery Research, the potential in the tides deserves a particular interest right now.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, sunlight and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is the tide energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to already invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
