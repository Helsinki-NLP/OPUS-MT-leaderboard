Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An insane institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Smallholders farm the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to come to light.
It is annoying when maps are not up to date.
Everyone who had to get upset before knows this because the car-navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer of the state government’s Bavaria geoportal, are far from current – but precisely for this reason very revealing.
Especially when compared to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork carpet that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called Urpositionsblätter, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Surveying Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and resulted from the first surveying of Bavaria.
Its client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map.
Elector Max IV. Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library, like all others.
The comparison between Early and Today is most impressive on the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, that is, in 1877, as a Munich district.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered corridors from the so-called "original" from which the land tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy there farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street name "at Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf den Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, people with delusions were once imprisoned here on the Auerfeldstraße.
There, in 1858/59, the Munich County Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was created.
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chaining of the so-called madmen.
He also forbade the staff to use violence against the inmates,” says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who was involved with the institution for an exhibition.
At first there had been room for 280 patients, later it was expanded to 500 seats.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost has been located there, one of the largest psychiatric centres in Germany.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, to the east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was erected - architecturally reminiscent of the original construction of the madhouse, which had been destroyed in bombings during World War II.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Hauptplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
Allied bombs broke many holes into the city center in December 1944.
A great one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval tomb chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the spade punch for the second S-Bahn line will take place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to the aerial view of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled.
Citizens’ Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People has issued a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and be extremely cautious when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the group said in a statement.
A recently passed Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed,” said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, to the Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints at such a frequency that we haven’t heard yet.”
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after being detained by Missouri police without being charged with a crime while traveling through the state.
The Council also points out a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
“The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared to bring bail or let their relatives know they’re traveling through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, which ranks the state 16th in terms of the number of such injuries in the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but lately stakeholder groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidefenz project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU deputies Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have obtained a picture on the spot.
Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverband met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Schwendemann family’s legal graveyard.
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, feeds 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
"Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, Schwendemann said.
On the table of the holiday guests comes only regional.
Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the grazing fence project as "elementary important".
I cannot make a profit on such steep land.
The grassland area is a lot of work, much has to be worked with the motorsense.
"We are struggling with conditions and topography here," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and manages it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The Municipality has recognized the importance of the grazing fence project and is pleased with the Leader funding".
At a cost of between 3,000 and 4,000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be pulled out for a long time.
“The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and worry about how they can continue their operations,” the mayor said.
Farmers are often criticized for their support.
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in via the grazing fence.
The open area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71,500 euros, half was funded by Leader, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of grazing fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible".
Peter Weiss once said, “The best foods are produced here.”
The Landscaping Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state to support grazing fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a funding backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the fenced area must not be tractor-manageable (hangage above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidefenz project 2018, the application is currently underway by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build a fence of just under 16 kilometers.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing holy anymore?
Now the White House of Trump takes over the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN’s Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked their significance, and in particular the significance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
As Miller Acosta said, “I don’t want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are referring to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller is right in fact, but as he put it himself, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the upheaval words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your weariness, your poor, / your oppressed masses, longing to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich shores."
There has never been a time when the “evil waste” was better visible on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and his friends, who fought to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they carried out a highly political action.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by depicting in an worn-out classical depiction the female embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing had long wanted to change this back.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative who brings the American flame into the night-time world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to illuminate the way to the United States.”
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it’s about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And of course, that’s not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Its torch should not illuminate the way, but rather ignite hatred, which is its only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish team members from the UK
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the British team
The performance director of the United Kingdom’s athletics, Neil Black, says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad “will make a massive contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn from it.
“We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to do so until we find out,” Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart – who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000-metre track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to become team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain’s speech was incredible,” Black says.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, left the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in was great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it’s “unbelievable” that there are 16 Scots on the British team.
Scotland’s best total number of athletes so far at the World Championship was seven, reached in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-range runner Muir leads this way and set five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500m and 5,000m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it very special for me," she added.
“Obviously, I’m very proud of all the Scots that are part of the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to get on podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it’s just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don’t apply for a public office if you can’t tolerate the incitement of voters
The father of our country knew something about the bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the criticism, of course.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silently and dumbly, we will be led as sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor’s staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with “Well, and?” .
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state, which is astonishingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his site.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news,” she wrote in the post’s commentary section.
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people comment on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor’s staff called a “concentrated spam attack” would likely be called “internally speaking.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing when staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
This is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for blaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this matter fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter-writers beat his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
People who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that undermined Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected from the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he did not silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led to the finals at Archerfield Links last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen the Renaissance Club built, and we’re seeing it reach its glory with this event,” Rafferty said.
Players will see this course from its best side, it is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He is an avid supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course.”
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I’m glad how it went so far.”
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
“According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking,” said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own 1994 study on this subject.
At that time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths per year from passive smoking in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are reasonably in time," says the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since there is a lot hidden underground, which is not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which constantly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and gates is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road is blocked and only buses are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been quite exhausting.
But luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with zealous, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, for example washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
“Nobody dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.,” she says.
It is a rare glimpse into the daily life of the Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote through a public survey before the occupation troops.
An existing movement that stirred up independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning car ride by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The town, with about 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs that have been converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” Degei says, pointing to her vivid, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
“In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia’s golden land.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix’s Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a New Jersey-sized highland province with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 people have been killed in Papua and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua’s tribal highland in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We will lose everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of previous year’s atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture – rape and electric beatings are particularly popular according to another report – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws have intensified as Papua’s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung Cantines sell fried chicken and Gado Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to keep up.
“The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables cheaper on the traditional market than the local Papua,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to work in the provincial capital Jayapura.
"It has cost the native Papua - the mom-mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Paniai - on his way to Jakarta's Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point just two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers stumbled at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk, hunted and beat the group with their bullets, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch outside the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - continuously in circles and imitating a birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they will shoot them dead," it says in an official document by TIME that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn’t know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
“It was crowded, many shots were fired,” he added.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead...I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" her station because she was being attacked.
“We must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us,” said Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings came to Jakarta the following day only 'filtered'.
Three weeks ago, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical ills in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he is establishing an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
The excuses began almost immediately.
“Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be going through,” he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, who has been charged by the UN with “crimes against humanity” calling for more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations had already been resolved in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with fierce infidelity.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress at all,” Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid of being arrested by the military, I’m afraid of being shot.”
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
“After burying the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a clash between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a man unconscious to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company’s location office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.
“We were so panicked that we are afraid there will be revenge,” said 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were quickly admitted here.
“I’ve been hiding in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua’s rights by instigating sporadic attacks and abductions by Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially note and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each work four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or skills to run their own businesses competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain strained.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy director of Asia at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s campaign promises to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
“There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia’s troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a blacklist,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua’s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations and told reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressed him “We want freedom”, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, the Paniai people are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, view their voice for Jokowi as a “debt” that he must repay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai gunmen carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site directly opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they don’t let those responsible forget their crimes.
“One member of our family was killed,” Yacobus said with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's 'torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire broke through in one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire sweeping through the high-rise building in just two years, which is coincidentally called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” a resident who named him George told Reuters.
Dubai civil protection officials said firefighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building at around 4 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT).
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in exterior areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the panelling, exterior panelling, decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of panels for insulation and disguise at London’s Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has failed at the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup coup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was slightly not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The often very long, but also very appreciated five-set classics thus remain the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, so ITF President David Haggerty’s goal was barely missed.
“We respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the full reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the competition.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the finals in a neutral place had not even come to a vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: For example, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host rights in the first round the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements for training venues etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. Travelers Bring Banned Items On Airplane, Survey Finds
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent consciously or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the aircraft while accidentally wearing prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they discovered that they had traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives in error.
The survey of more than 1,000 people — conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. — also found that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were Generation X members.
The most common items that were deliberately carried past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs on the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally brought smuggling through airport security and how many had intentionally done so.
It’s no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry smuggling goods – knowingly or unknowingly – through safety were the ones who were most likely to fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about what liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are forbidden liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might see books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, he has ruled out that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the increasingly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time another, less brilliant figure: that of the cancellations of the new mass market Model 3.
In recent months, Musk has frequently advertised with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Musk admits that of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 euros (in the U.S. $1,000 and in the UK <0xC2><0xA3>1,000) “reservation deposit” in full.
Currently, there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge for the ambitious growth goals lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models are expected to be 500,000, and in 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are currently added per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, never tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are major delays, then the non-binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA CEO Pruitt Withdraws Due to Delaying Obama Era Emissions Reduction Rules
A day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency was more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It is a deadline that expires on October 1st for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-based ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid “interfering with local decisions or hampering economic growth.”
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma’s prosecutor prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly sought to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
Wednesday’s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator had exceeded its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his shift to ozone standards would simply enhance the EPO’s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely meeting the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation,” said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that exists to us seriously.”
Nevertheless, the EPO’s statement said that at some point Pruitt will use his “delaying powers and all other legal powers” to ensure that the regulations are “based on sound policy and the best available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA – according to our lawsuits – is an important gain for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flowing into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered at Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
“It’s worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the one responsible for protecting the air we inhale,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump administration to call on environmental polluters and their special interests.”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg Documentary Book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church at Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the wording of the document, there was also a stately court on the Tumlinger Berg besides the former parish church, to which the church or the patronage law belonged and not vice versa.
There were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today can still be seen in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around 1600 underpin these historical facts.
The patronage law arose from the early medieval proprietary church law.
A lord who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this own church.
This entailed the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The largest of the two fractured on Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be surrendered later in World War II in 1942.
During the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were slammed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops encamped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was broken down.
Only the church tower was left.
On New Year's Eve 1834 a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Scientific Retirees" as successors to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, the friends and promoters of Tumlingen invite to the St. Hilarius Chapel on Sunday, 16 July, for the sixth serenade at the old cemetery.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Chief of Staff Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 pm.
To finish the serenade, a drink will take place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
Tumlingen’s friends and supporters feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim resists" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim resists" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it, due to a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning legal prerequisites, the granted approval order is still unlawful and therefore also withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim resists".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council has again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; an approval of the district government is still pending.
Recognizes: "Thus, at this point, the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded by planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the Kreis Viersen since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them as an occasion to reconsider the matter.
However, they are not expected to cause the procedure to be stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle did not want to express itself on Thursday content to the argument of the association "Boisheim wehert sich".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11,400 households are expected to be met - that is about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-family households.
NEW Re plans to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash: Woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn district).
One woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road was blocked for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich was driving with her 53-year-old mother on the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and dealers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are scheduled to rediscover shopping in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure residents to go shopping in the city center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is to sensitize customers to what offers the city has away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training positions.
In addition, the shops of the city center are to invite to "midnight shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
With this, the trade association and the city are going into another stage of the project "Attraktive Innenstadt".
These include new offers such as the first "active day" at the fountain festival including a Sunday open for sale, discussions with all tradesmen and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include tourists and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the downtown when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to invigorating the downtown - to landlords, the whole city's businesses and clubs.
It was possible to overcome lethargy with a network, which had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, said that five Thuringian cities participated for the first time in the third home shopping day nationwide.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "advocate the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," Streich said.
The action under the leadership of the ICC and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her buying behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine others injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) another wounded person was in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was later also found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of misfortune, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people were in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico after leaked transcripts of phone calls over paying for border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted him for publicly denouncing the wall and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern U.S. border, vowing to have Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade deal for U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia would be “ridiculous,” “mis” and “dumb,” and that the existence of the trade deal that was mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a “dumb” after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Turnbull "this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists reprise racist lynch as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the Ford Bridge at Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long pull on his cigar and looked through the windshield examining.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n ----r Roger!" cried the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence when a young black man was pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene that was played on July 22 is just a remake.
But then, when a snare is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience ejected very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
“It’s really unbelievable that no one person has been arrested in all these years — although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the replica.
“It’s a dirt spot on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reproduction serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want prosecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We cannot attain healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A medical examiner placed a bedsheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one was ever charged.
Even though the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer’s pre-election campaign.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm renter Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester had slept with Malcom’s wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But as they then walked away from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison was the one who prepared and ordered the murders," the FBI said in a statement.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution that not only was involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks puts it even more concisely.
“It was a voting-right massacre,” he said.
They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual remake of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching, because then we will be confronted with its ugliness in all of us,” she said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t want to listen to me or don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.”
Rehearsals for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors – a dozen white and the rest black – rushed into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not that,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm screaming at Hester and rushing him, angry that he had slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, get out of my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
“What?” asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still whispering.
“I just don’t think white people said ‘n--he’ back then.”
"Yes," joked one of the other black actors.
“You just have to hit the hard ‘R.’”
And that is where the energy shifts into the room, a feeling of companionship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the actors' bodies and delivers Billie Holiday's mourning praise speech "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wiped sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to watch the performance, many coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive moisture for nearly eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the still bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy murmurs as if he wants to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanked the crowd - and suddenly it was over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women whispered.
“We know it’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta are talking about the remodeling with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that the performance left behind.
“It’s hard to hear those horrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do because they look like you,” she said.
“What this really does to me makes me believe the lynching is still going on,” she added, “today it’s called just police shooting.”
In the same room Tyrone Brooks keeps court at his table, eating and reminiscent of civil rights.
He said he had already begun planning the performance next year.
“The remake is in some ways inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own history, whoever does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it.
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful and frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with wall rest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of this parks an open Mercedes-Oldtimer, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's guiding motif - money, power and greed - which flows through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood-style manner and gives the Krawallo click.
Stephen Milling sings the beautifully ugly Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later on, Gunther (Markus Oak) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and Dirigent Janowski are being celebrated in a stormy way, humblely bowing their hands to the Merkel-Raute.
There is great applause for the Festspielorchester, which shows up on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in casual casual clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
Had he still had to go through a whistling whistle concert in 2013, there were great jubilation five years later in which the isolated "Buh" calls went down.
Festival boss Katharina Wagner may have been pleased.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also grew an understanding of his point of view.
I draw a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I have also been working at school all day.
What is your experience with it?
Quantity: It’s a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late-call volunteer.
How's that going to happen?
Quantity: I did high school.
And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully discontinued.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, to work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on site, perhaps in the focal point, really is.
And was it?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
In the winter semester, I will start my studies in social services.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Youth Office Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn’t it unusual to have several different locations during volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
For me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
There are always other people in front of their heads who each have a different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to address it individually.
Very interesting.
And you weren't afraid of touch?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
It’s an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but that’s how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program was launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.
The job reduction, which chief executive John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to his previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, in a third cost reduction program, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was made through the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged after gaining 1 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul Convoy Attack: NATO Soldier Killed in Suicide Attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed one NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence Afghanistan has committed this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a statement, NATO said the blast took place Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-carried improvised explosive device".
The statement says that all the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country’s deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs up the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay a regulation by the Obama administration that states are obliged to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to push forward the so-called “Ozone Regulations 2015” and said it shows the agency’s commitment to work with states.
“We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners,” EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s intention to delay ozone regulations — in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards — by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed lawsuits on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has tried to push back a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the efforts have triggered the setback of Democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of higher emissions on public health.
The EPA website says inhaling air containing ozone “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
City Council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluor-Winzeln decides to set up a community space in the future seniors residence.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the land has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take until the area previously owned by the church community is in the possession of the municipality, there is now no obstacle to planning for the project to be originated by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a community area.
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council intend to provide such a common space not as a meeting place only for the residents of senior-friendly living, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "knitted cafe" made the round.
The decision, which was preliminarily decided by the provision of funds for the current budget as early as last autumn, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The construction is in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a community area would be eligible, according to Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a stick between their legs in this respect, the decision provides that both saddle--which is based on the environment--and pult roof--which reduces the trunk height and makes the construction more economical--would be possible.
Unnecessarily, not only does Wilfried Sohmer think, is this addition.
If it helps, he passes the board unanimously.
It is not so easy for the community.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you do not make so much progress, but you now lean out the common room from the window, she says: "I am hard to do with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the community space - but absolutely against community participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to wealthy or even foreign investors anyway.
This is not the case, because the purchase of the area does not give a subsidy, but rather receives a real equivalent, marketable in case of doubt, is the counter-argument.
Staiger's request to split the proposal accordingly finds three supporters.
As Stefan Haller puts it: “If we make the decision this way, we will take a giant step towards closing a giant gap in our infrastructure.”
Collision with car: Radler is thrown on the road
An 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday while crossing the road and was seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been coming from Hilden on his bicycle path on the Schwarzer Weg at 12.20 a.m.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder was driving on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the opposite traffic.
He crashed into a car that was driven by a 66-year-old Hildenerine.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich must give up David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to leave the game against Dortmund.
With personnel concerns, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory match of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The personnel concerns of the German football record champion Bayern Munich are increasing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 am / ZDF and Eurosport) with the cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to give up David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Munich players Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
Ancelotti has blamed his team’s physical condition and lack of balance for the five losses in the past six test games.
"We know we are not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
Last time it wasn't good."
The 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play smart,” said Ancelotti, who expects a “difficult, intense game.”
The duel of the two German football heavyweights attracts the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking from star to star in the resin
In the Harz, the first "Star Path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations in five to six locations" in the Oberharz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be in question.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star trail train is to be extended by train.
"On the star path, viewers learn a lot of valuable information, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star is brighter than another, even though it is much further away.
It also tells us which constellation a selected star is in and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Frequently, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen clearly with the naked eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the promotional association Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Star Wars - the Planetarium Path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community similar) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at a distance and scale from one to two billion.
The Earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun standing exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super Featherweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are members of the top five-pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you all the best."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
“I got up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That is what the fans demand.
Let’s give them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to settle a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in battling Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said, later expressing himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you are ready...”
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as “a huge fighter,” and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said he thinks the three-fighter from Riverside looks "very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-off."
Garcia said the focus was to show punch strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that needs to be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tyre breaker
In an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. just before the connection point Marktbreit, presumably after a tyre breaker.
The car swung to the right into the aperture, where he swung himself over and then remained lying on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the first care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked towards the north for about an hour, then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation brings points in Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, with the result too, if there had not been the two opposing goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"Two goals were too much, and we have to take even better care in Aue," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains, the triangular chain is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick the fortunes no longer want to catch themselves.
“For the future, no one will be on the line alongside Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that even after his experience in preparation, his team will be better off with the three-way chain than with the four-way chain.
"I still don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have players right now in the three-way chain on the semis in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and we don't afford to make so many play mistakes in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But whether we can talk about a failed start after a draw is unclear.
The performance could be quite okay,” Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a decent start to the season."
His coach didn’t want to know that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel said and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing favorite in their bones.
"But they don't know as much as 100 percent where they are currently," says the Fortune's defenseman.
Although the guests from the Rhineland will go as an easy favorite on Sunday to meet in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we sweep them away just because we have the claim to be in the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start,” Fortuna’s head coach explains.
“Making such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant.”
And so Funkel does not want to see his players on Sunday.
New Results of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests Released
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of people tested are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rattsmedicinalverket) has begun conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum process, they should make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was “possibly 18 years of age or older.”
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under the age of 18".
The tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent in recent months.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are fairly constant,” he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his or her age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests, saying there were 442 cases that “suggest the person being examined is 18 years of age or older.”
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published findings, she found that in 243 of those cases, the person had openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case, that’s about 10 percent.”
Fully in the plan
Work on the three bridges on the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Freiburg Government Presidium.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three renovation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the building is planned for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule is kept.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted bridge made of concrete, clad in red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy bridge cap.
This is an edge fastening that is also used as an operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
This is what the pedestrian path is supposed to be.
The special thing about this is that they are finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The installation of pipes by the building in Lauterbach required a special sense of fingertips.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project by handbooks in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be caught first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher Ortseingang the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.
The cost of the three bridge renovations together amounts to 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest on German potato salad
It is not so often that parties draw on one line, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD) comes together, which is otherwise difficult to bring under one head.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) represented in the Volcanic Eifel district hall are part of a broad alliance that displays a peaceful flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the "large campaign opening" according to the poster.
And brings to the start well-known names - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and the deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD-learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forums Eine Welt and one of the key organizers, really delights: "Great how many people have gathered here".
There’s music and a lot of food, including an “Urdu potato salad that the AfD could easily eat,” says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he had endeavored to make such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but received a rejection there because there were not enough parking spaces due to the already built Laurentius kirmes.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell Vorplatz, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
It does as well: Around 8 p.m. on the Rondellvorplatz a band provides entertainment, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to hold their speeches.
The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officers had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the front square have a longer breath, but also there is to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can get away - no special events.
Trumpet meets Trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the series of Haslacher Monastery Concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the Monastery Church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in the blast music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is the solo trumpeter of the prestigious Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the solo trompeter of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of different genres.
For the two, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new costume, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz-echo prize-winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core part of the programme was premiered in Freiburg this spring with great success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is deliberately involved in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try it all out,” Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'"
Probably the most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was that with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, which eventually went bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
It has never confused or hindered me.
I never liked not to be taken seriously.”
According to "Bang Showbiz" she suffered particularly from this, but in school, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think, ‘Girl, be proud of you!’”
Especially to the public, she doesn’t like to explain her love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don’t like having to justify myself in front of the public.”
The Governor of West Virginia Announces He's Changing the Party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,” Governor Justice said.
“Today I will tell you with a lot of prayers and a lot of thought...today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor.”
The rally broke out in cheerfulness.
“Tomorrow I will change my registration with the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play another game.”
Mr. Trump promised a major announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes finds that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday evening saying, “The change of governor Justice’s party is another blow to a Democratic party that would stop us rather than work to make our country great again.”
“With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is only the last rejection of a party that has no leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises 'honest' Russian apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief Sebastian Coe praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal on Thursday, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to get back into the sport.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country’s expulsion from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for “all athletes who were snatched away gold and silver medals in competitions.”
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought today was a very open answer, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized to itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.”
Coe said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepts the criteria for his re-introduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force’s recommendations that this is not the time to re-establish Russia,” Coe said.
“We need to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for a re-employment.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still working freely, he told reporters in London after a speech at the IAAF Council.
Mourning for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a mourning ceremony in Fritzlar, northern Hesse, around 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
On the unresolved cause of the crash, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two pilots who had perished as “the masters of their craft.”
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse were killed Wednesday in West Africa’s Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a watch of the Bundeswehr to Fritzlar Cathedral Sankt Peter.
At noon, only the family members of the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the celebration began in the circle of family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politics.
Among them were Hesse’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Guests of mourning laid roses, their relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Minister von der Leyen described the perished soldiers as "highly decorated" and operational experience.
The captain was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment to have built up the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, which the soldiers belong to, also declared: "If this crew could not prevent the crash, then no one would have been able to".
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen that the deployment is dangerous.
But it is also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the mourning ceremony, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title.
After the ascent of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired, taking the title "Prince's Marriage".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he does not regard himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death, said Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobleman, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
On the Thames he worked in the French embassy.
During his later wife's reign of almost 50 years, Prince Henrik had a difficult position with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said of the first years in Denmark: “A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine over beer, silk stockings over knitted socks, Citroën over Volvo, tennis over football.
Even for the Gauloises who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation here for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I couldn’t hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, Stephan Weil (SPD), after the loss of the red-green majority of the government, is for a swift re-election of the state parliament, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday he called for the dissolution of parliament.
Previously, the surprising departure of a Green MP from her parliamentary faction in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the parliamentary elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition of the CDU and the FDP.
Greens member Elke Twesten justified her move by not nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said Friday in Hanover.
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to join them.
The CDU and FDP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, the SPD and the Greens 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on January 14th next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it indispensable that the Landtag decides his self-dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament withdraws the confidence of the prime minister and elects a successor.
“Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined legally cleanly," Thümler said.
"You will be quietly discussing all issues if they are legally reasonably examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but somewhat curious".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She called herself a supporter of black-green.
The Greens called on the apostate MPs to return their parliamentary mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she returns her mandate to the state parliament, which she has received via the green list of states, with immediate effect," said the country's presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
Green Group leader Anja Piel said: "We regret Elke Twesten's decision extremely."
It has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even given the fact that there were no content differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxon Greens MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Greens in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters, but also betrayal of Red-Green," he wrote on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag re-elected quickly.
The departure of Twestens costs the majority in Lower Saxony.
“In her wounded vanity and frustration, she puts her personal interests before the good of the country,” said SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
“It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue game and tries to draw political capital from it.”
Lower Saxony CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his deputies to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The faction leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 parliamentary elections with personal career thinking.
The CDU was at the time the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and answering in an interview with the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamping.
On the consumer protection portal www.lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states submit the latest information about the affected egg loads.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to all we currently know, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightenment is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately opened up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the knowledge of the affliction of Germany.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade and manufacturers have to ensure that the products sold are safe and safe for health.
If the maximum residue content of 0.005 mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not commercially available.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time it's not the farms' fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly responsible.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in an emergency.
Is it only the staff or the conclusive competence lacking?
It was the official controls that uncovered the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handing over to the prosecutors in cases where there may be crimes are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect full enlightenment from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and accessible foodstuffs.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
By means of the pants, manufacturers, distributors and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the unlawful use of the insecticide fipronil in the holding of food-providing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the situation promptly and completely.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar’s world record transfer from Spain’s Barcelona to France’s Paris-Saint-Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the governing organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that at some point PSG must prove that Neymar’s transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must counteract with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election to UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debt in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the clubs’ debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 -- buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand -- was to become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million.
And while Platini fell into disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to work to deter excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will surely tighten the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, UEFA's FFP manager, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid for Neymar’s buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer amount of 44.4 million euros for the next five years can be reported in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
PSG received a fine of €60 million (at that time $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that team members for the 2014/15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to defraud their financial oversight by inflating their revenues by companies connected to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments from the World Cup 2022 Organizational Committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will be a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could be easy to figure out for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG generated a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015/16 with sales of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymar’s departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
“It’s a clear case of ‘financial doping’ with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar’s ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that finances a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
“As soon as a country has a club, anything is possible.
It’s going to be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country.”
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline is re-issuing the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Approximately 17 million small red-white packed 14 grams of chocolate boards distribute the flight attendants to passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect: For a Schoggi manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
How many applicants there are in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to betray.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to strive for a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006.
Before Swiss entered into a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago by Swiss with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, first-class customers are spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class passengers snacking Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi by Chocolat Frey also distributes on the short-haul route, both in business and in the economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, 2016 Olympic winner, had failed in the national World Cup draw and could only watch the Discus competition from the stand.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish championship defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, qualified for the final match.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This replay of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s Grunge era (when the thought-provokers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Paul and Rudd's, Am.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By getting stuck to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they still made it impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more on the watering can principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character browses through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates, and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-vicious plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is now backed by George H. W. Bush (a successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It’s especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon’s underlip beard from “Singles,” whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It’s the moments of random insanity that could fuel this franchise like a repetitive “Seven Up!” series until it reaches what I assume is its logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” whose final scene will show the band how they will attend the film premiere of “Wet Hot American Summer.”
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-to-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles – a harsh Gregor and an idealistic Iosef – are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's an ingenious idea.
But it’s not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend their time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it moves in, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
“Comrade Detective,” edited to a shorter length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make anything a food for a feast.
The fictitious Romanian creators weren’t wrong: we’re even doing it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Punishment of drug mafia in the country
The police managed to strike the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Prosecutor's Office of Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and ordered to arrest them.
In addition, officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspected Italians.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were on duty.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, severe violence, attempted murder, and robbery and blackmail.
Since summer 2016, the Constance Public Prosecutor’s Office has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and Kripo Rottweil investigators had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
As a result, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations focused mainly on Italian nationals with a close connection to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to be on the account of the gang.
Wise complains about large gaps in the foreigner register
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreigner registry in Germany has significant deficiencies.
This leads to some serious wrong decisions in asylum proceedings.
According to a media report, the Federal Government’s refugee management commissioner, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "partially serious wrong decisions" in asylum proceedings and deportations, warned a way in an analysis that is available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the registry, 10 million people with foreign nationality are registered, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
Accordingly, the data is managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register."
"Incorrect data entry can significantly slow down return processes," the report said.
In addition, the statistics on people who are obliged to leave the EU include EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
Such incorrect assignments, however, “led to a distorted debate about dealing with those required to leave,” according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy when they have arrived from there.
This is apparent from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF is conducting such procedures "in respect of families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the spot.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU state they reach first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
As a justification, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has given guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, a spokeswoman for the left-wing party in the Bundestag, criticized the decision: “Families with children threaten unlawful conditions of admission due to the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system and a threat to the well-being of children.”
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
All in all Jürgen Greule, who has now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the Municipal Council, the congregation recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood.
“It is brilliant how our bodies are designed to do so and we respect the donors who provide their blood to strangers, even unselfishly,” said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the German Red Cross (DRC), because the canned products are broken down into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRC's head of readiness.
Obviously, the move to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many are recorded by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe cousin gave out 500 milliliters of their life juice ten times a day.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and slowing inflation have dampened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “low” as it maintained interest rates on family incomes amid increasing pressure.
The policymakers of the Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall.
But she signaled that in the coming years interest rate hikes would be needed to curb Brexit-fuelled inflation, and she said credit costs may need to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic recovery package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks starting next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more under this system - at 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption."
Regarding interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "somewhat larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would take place “step-wise” and “limited”.
The Bank’s downward-adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
It maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision does not change after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for interest rate hikes and GDP increased from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year after the bank.
The most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases, as the tightening first gets worse before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy cannot “prevent” income decline over the next few years, but she added that wages will “significantly” recover at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption spending.
The decision comes one year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank’s last rate judgment, the call for an interest rate hike had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-hit households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9 percent in June to 2.6 percent last month, although the bank said it was expected to do so and will attract it again in the coming months.
The bank said the exceedance in relation to its 2% target was "whole" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive once again as lenders look for deals loudly and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who are expiring the existing deals and closing the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular.
NHS (National Health Service) to Prescribe Controversial HIV Drug 10,000 People
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle in the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-sex pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study of estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Appeals Court last year confirmed a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the authority to pay for PrEP despite claiming that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an “important new intervention,” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be launched across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications are present in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify appropriate participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP may also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The aim of the study is to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Shadow Health, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt takes us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be conducted as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV, and that it help us get one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the Great Life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrank from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It’s located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it’s proof of the new design that Joanne didn’t pack and sell her bags.
“Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room,” Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely renovated.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement,” she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the prerequisite.
“The steel plant is quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the up or down function.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home,” Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that through good design and increased square footage, an apartment can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave her.
Brothers fight over $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, find themselves in a dispute over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate about the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers owned 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes downtown offices, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centers.
Following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one-third.
One court file states that this means Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now struggling to control the existing business — from which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage requires that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and both-sided law firms.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property kindly to their sons.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin has been very restrained despite being a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the television star’s best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by text to say “I really can’t say much” because the case was in court.
“It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and take our family name through the courts,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
“Our father wouldn’t have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a solution.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
“Our matter will be settled by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to curtail the president’s media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in hopes of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that got into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow — whether on paper or in briefings — because the president would make better decisions if he got good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades — and now that he’s in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions that were convincing,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes steady praise.”
-Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know about others — that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.
If his employees have already managed to keep him away from trouble several times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may further their views of the world.
Politico, who is busy with this story, reported in May on the preference of the advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffened to find out where they come from.
That’s exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a pile of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter “have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives.”
How did it go?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is requested and hoped.
This summer, police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the serious criminals sought by nature are not known, clues from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the action following the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar of winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding at holiday destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been available, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
So far, 36 of those sought online have been arrested, at least eleven of them on the basis of notices posted on the website.
Travelers negotiate a trench and return to 'Millionaires Series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are again standing on the feet of war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a community-drawn trench to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the “Millionaires Series.”
They brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out only in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council to prevent their intrusions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unimpeded to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed Solihull’s council, which said it “is useless to deal with the problem.”
An anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably more today.”
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instruction to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the council can’t even stop it.”
One resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area."
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: “We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls police and we are taking the necessary legal steps to get them moving forward as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we are filing our case.”
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on March 1 next year.
This is good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a housing plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the City Council.
But above all, the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction scrap containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful close to citizens", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
A swimming pool, a spa area and a meeting room are also available.
One does not want to position oneself on the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, Scherer stresses.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to be broad, Scherer explains.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The city’s visions are identical to those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine himself precisely.
It is less than a million euros, he estimates.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US special investigator sets up grand jury
In the Russia affair with US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel has begun its work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper saw the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there were already first subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of intently meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were any agreements between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the election campaign.
Mueller also reportedly examined more and more of Trump’s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Special Investigator Trump had personally come to the center and is investigating the allegation that the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine existing evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand Jurys are also called Prosecution Chambers.
Usually they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The process always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel can also be called up by the prosecutor’s office to invite persons to be interrogated under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting were asked to testify, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then-election campaign leader Paul Manafort were also in the conversation.
Law experts said Thursday evening on U.S. television that the establishment shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will be activated in the end to decide on the raising of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“The history of Russia is a total invention,” Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to “feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.”
His special adviser Ty Cobb said in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a grand jury.
They usually work in secret, he said.
The White House supports any action that has "fairly" accelerated the Special Investigator's work.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he is not being investigated against the president.
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed, the statement said.
Mueller was deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Due to this expulsion, accusations had been made against Trump that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media reports, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff.
This sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted Mueller to be fired.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as in the Watergate affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the urging of the President by the Department of Justice.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills Thursday that would make it difficult for the special investigator to be fired.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg floats in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached itself from the shelf ice.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus weighing over a trillion tons and measuring 5,800 square kilometers is now driving north and will probably take two, three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded over the past three decades.
There is no danger to people from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years, the U.S. Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus was so far part of the Larsen-C shelf.
Shelf ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf ice, the balance of growth and breakdown was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shelf ice has collapsed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot of evidence that the Larsen-C shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is today.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can decay if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of shelf ice and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they float on the water and ice displaces as much water as it results after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelf ice causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could potentially raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Observation Research Project (Midas).
Larsen-C shelf ice is the fourth largest shelf ice in Antarctica, with nearly 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University.
"This is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Scientists are controversial about whether the Larsen-C scalp will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice sheets of the Antarctic Peninsula have decayed in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature increase contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising the fastest.
CDU wants to pay a house rate for staff
As it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break did the county council wink through 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
Apparently the teaching positions in the circle are highly sought after.
Approximately 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unoccupied positions at Mettmann County.
Doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative in the Kreistag together with the FDP and the UWG and counter the lack of skilled workers in the administration.
The administration should, in accordance with the wishes of the parties, "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwards, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training campaign, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you used to not know this way.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave their jobs due to illness or age.
Time to act so that no more jobs are left unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint proposal with his party.
He caused a big surprise in the district council recently, when he publicly questioned the staff costs ceiling and amazed the other parties.
Völker wants to have all the possibilities that allow an exit from the municipal employers’ association reviewed.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the municipalities - should seek a domestic tariff," said Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the Public Service Tariff Act actually provides.
Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level, which is oriented to professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on the protection of prostitutes.
Last but not least, due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little personnel.
Italy Strengthens Tonus on NGO Migrant Rescue Boats
Italy has warned NGOs deploying rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they may not continue to do so unless they comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because its crew had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only assess any accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that its crew is taking inflatable migrants on board who are delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring about "substantial changes or impediments" to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and work with local mayors had paid off.
“In the last few days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelkapelle above Deidesheim in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which you could look far beyond the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim for the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, viewpoint lined up to viewpoint, connected by "flowing" trials and moderate ascents.
In the last two days there were many meters of altitude again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and lodges brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, bikers breathed healing sole in the outdoor inhalator.
Neustadt was also attacked.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate forest from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sport
Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of being sweaty in the wind and weather to fight over the stadium grass?
Fact: E-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages included.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The start was made in 2015 by VfL Wolfsburg, later by FC Schalke 04 and lastly by VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope that this will inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there are still a lot of clubs on this train".
Next weekend, the FIFA World Football Association will host the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, in which gamers from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially Asian ones.
With prominent athletes under contract, you could be present online in these markets far more often than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are contested at the competitive level.
Long ago, as in normal sports, leagues have been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of habituation.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should train not only on the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Frobuse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, this is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association for Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is set to be 130 million.
Against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little.
However, e-sport "is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisers write.
Internationally, many countries are already moving forward.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball player Shaquille O<0x60>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
Some things are also happening in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a subject of instruction, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and in France, the football league associations are now obliged, according to Dutt, to set up an e-sports department.
"In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB Executive Board member Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and exalting the old days, is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time align the company with the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays as it always has been."
Poison Eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states have been affected by the scandal about poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and removed all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no fipronil should be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Conrad Roy's Suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said Thursday at the hearing: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes facing down when she was convicted.
“Their actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility,” she said.
“She did not show any repentance.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that she totally regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find that their "age or degree of maturity or even their mental illness has a significant influence on their actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, that “there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will endure for eternity.”
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "chased" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
“Not having this one person I’ve been with since I was born every day is a pain I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that they encouraged him to end his life.
“Hang yourself up, jump out of a building, stabb yourself, I don’t know there are many ways,” she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before her suicide, she wrote, “You have to do it, Conrad,” and “All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through any press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-lamm
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to compete as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner to have a great season - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different about his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since there was of course no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer to be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, he made the tie that was assigned to him.
"The coach did not announce it," the Confed Cup winner said after his first appointment as Bayern captain.
Well, the draw could have been better than in the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could interpret Kimmich as well.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as the leader in the C-Eleven, consisting of youth players, debutants and just from the holidays.
Zuckerl is best distributed to those whom you trust a lot, which you want to keep in the mood.
So whoever has been chosen to take on the legacy of lame can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich said: “This is what you want as a player: to take responsibility.”
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-lame.
Right back, this is his position now, the white tie on his arm did its rest.
And in this starting formation, Kimmich looked like the one who can also take the rudder in the best hands.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed force.
He looked at the whole thing, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal overplayed his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches overplayed his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches overplayed his lack of fitness (hardly worked); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle overplayed his lack of fitness in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, it worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted sovereignly.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried successfully a few times in the game setup.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not as we had hoped".
But he also showed a decent performance at his debut.
Game shift, change of pace: "I was brought for this style too."
How unusual this Bavarian world is still for the new additions, you saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but rather six or seven.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements behind the back of his new teammates.
There he heard from Süle an interesting sentence: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he doesn’t have to teach the new ones anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer just before the match, he tweeted and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian legionnaire is almost a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is feverish with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
The famous Bavarian duel might well be needed by our ladies.
Business satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy on T V request - and at the same time rebuke the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Trier Business Association (VTU), says: “Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has blocked all of them.”
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: The gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
Later this year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan determination procedure, by 2021 the construction law is to be laid down.
The west bypass of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal road plan, also plays a role in the country's plans.
The aim is to get the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier aims, as suggested by Wissing, to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the passed master’s exam and 2500 euros if graduates are self-employed within ten years of the master’s training.
But the list of homework for the country remains long.
At the same time, the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to hire at the state-owned mobility company, only 29 jobs have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, the CDU’s deputy commissioner, refers to the Court of Auditors’ calculations that the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The current broadband expansion in the country is also disappointing.
In 2016, regional companies assessed grid supply only with a rating of 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about deadly internet connections and breakdowns.
Ex-Economic Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she was already clearing the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash
A day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes “there are smarter options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is based – to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost to automakers to install plants to neutralize the exhaust emissions emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of harassing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could use so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested, but return under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could severely burden Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message was sent to the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the visitors of Isar to participate, a raft will sail through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
If it draws again to the Isar on Saturday, he will see there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke a large raft.
And this is not a regular raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The launch of a publicity campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
The motto "True love is ..." is to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a wild river worth protecting.
Already last summer the raft sailed over the Isar and again this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's Knot Noses and Laughing Against Suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most-released cartoon illustrators, and the noses of his characters are his trademark.
At 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: “Laughter, because there is too much suffering in the world.”
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
During his early years as an artist, he worked as a congratulations card drawer, which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost in my job," he said once.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures are tumbling in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, plush animals and watches, his funny characters continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years, he has also been working on an animated film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-footer as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is due to hit the cinema screen in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s strange to me,” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That is why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-remembering conditions and disease-transmitting insects, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacteria that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only appeals to holidaymakers, it is also in great demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön is celebrating its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
On these days, shopkeepers, vendors, traders, vagants or a bondage camp are to be experienced in the city centre.
The killing of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The Riodoce weekly newspaper staff usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa state through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer: to take their children to the office, who were the target of a 2009 grenade attack, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government’s salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico’s chaos dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as the corpses pile up across the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is their editor and inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, the murderers are rarely brought to justice by journalists.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa’s violence, despite being discouraged and despite the terrain being even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
“Until we know why, we distrust everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot at 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Twelve River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely around in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings larger than many homes for the living.
For a minute, forget that there is a state of “rest” when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with blame for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
Initially, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for brave and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever he took it.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa “is a way of life,” he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the job that’s up to you as a journalist – either that or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his destruction?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job while staying alive.
“They don’t like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways” to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, "Smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce’s staff met for security training, phones were suddenly not allowed, and days earlier it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect Riodoce’s offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half jokingly, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers whom the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountains, where the drug gangs are under de facto control.
For this week’s edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on state spending, which focused on the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been charged with high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military robbery.
Just a few months earlier, readers had viewed Valdez’s column as the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"We would have known before what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body.
“Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken.”
Valdez’s office was re-dedicated to a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because the staff became something they would never have expected themselves: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning over another journalist to the prosecutor’s office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing “SOS Press” on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, director Bojorquez is gone to Washington, and there he tries to gather international support for the justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
She has since asked for her to be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are “surrounded” by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also at the order of politicians and security forces who were under cover with the organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Article 19" has attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials last year.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to be photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was over, Riodoce’s editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office and drank beer as all of their phones suddenly began to sum up.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the curb, they published the news on Riodoce's website on mobile.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens are howling up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers who were guarding to see if they were on standby.
If they were afraid, they wouldn’t show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think about closing it," Bojorquez said, "if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been preserved so well that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even notice that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "unsettling past."
The report in the journal "Current Biology" called him "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurus that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous period.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100-kg) earth lump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as countershading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mingle better in its environment and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurus family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealoopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the counter shade, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealoopelta far exceeds that of today’s live animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the obfuscation of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use counter-shadowing — think of deer, zebras, or belt animals — are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodesaurus was exposed to a real fight for survival.
“Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous era must have been,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the sea floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
“This nodaosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don’t have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you’re just shining a little with your eyes, you might almost believe he’s sleeping.”
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealoopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealoopelta sank into the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the nose to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long tips that protruded from his shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored plant eater was swept through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur’s underwater burial kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the other remains still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.'
In the thunderstorm: Mass carabulization on A8: Many injured
A severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carriage.
There are numerous injured, kilometer-long traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass carabulage late Thursday afternoon.
According to initial police reports, nearly 30 vehicles, probably including trucks, crashed into each other at around 5 p.m. between the connecting points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm.
Initially, there was no information on the exact number of injured.
It is about mild to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
A backlog of about ten kilometers was formed in the direction of Munich.
As an AZ reporter reports, there was also massive disability on the counterroad - due to numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade recorded the license plates of the drivers, who now have to expect delicate penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 another accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: You sit on the train and sleep without realizing anything.
Or you are deep in your work and just have an ingenious thought.
And then: Pufff.
If the shepherd comes and wakes a person unwelcomely or pulls the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unmanned ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and thereby devalue your ticket.
There is currently a test operation on two routes.
“If the offer comes, we’ll expand it.
It is then expected to be available on many other long-haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a spokesman for the railway.
"Comfort check-in" is called the devaluation of tickets without Schaffner.
However, to be able to use them, a few conditions must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do anyway.
You also have to use the app of the train purchased by DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear on the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives at place Y at the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can keep sleeping, keep working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train escort staff, simply check in in the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal,” says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr’s Marketing Board.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest hassles.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or ID card is missing or otherwise a document that must be presented.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, which leads to poor mood in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of your own ticket, and in the end, the manager takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to the core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and he's still on the street," it said.
Confused as no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the <0x40>TheePharoah handle was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was about to live tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“It’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped her phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police gang and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown’s father, carrying a sign that read, “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer unlocked his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
“This is not usual,” Ferrell recalled her statement.
“That’s not the kind of murder we’ve gotten used to and can call typical.”
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and cried.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in theaters starting on the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience that consists from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black condition.”
“Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?” she recalled what she said.
“We’re going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t right.
I couldn't take her with me," Ferrell later said.
“What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I’m lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally does not experience blatant racism, she’s no different than the next black woman child.
I feel like I would do her a bad service to keep her away.”
The first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a location opposite the police agency that became a campground as activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
“My activism has completely changed after August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell’s mind: “Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?”
This skepticism was nurtured by countless cases of people, often whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, “We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn’t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We are talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me how these people are portrayed, because that is how I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly reveal personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt like I was naked,” Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
“But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay.
“Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall,” Ferrell said, “and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that “the movement is really held up by black women and many black women.”
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
“She was the person who stirred up that energy,” she said.
“It’s no coincidence, even though she was at the forefront, because a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on parole for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and feels committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "dream" to "greatness madness": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is not yet built.
But the idea of a mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold is hardly leaving one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While the ones say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schauen), comes from the other side: "No man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Grand madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which stands the Farmer’s Market Hall, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of construction work, this will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Beda square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the farmer's market hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very much like.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, it also exists.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, depends on the amount of rent.
But it is not likely to be low in the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough of this in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, stores in a mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more special shops and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farmer’s market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit-gallery already manage to expel all shops from Bitburg beforehand?"
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farmer’s market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer’s market hall, there is no place anymore, thanks to the insanely many - I think - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmer’s market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again.”
A Matching Similarity: Artist Creates Portraits with Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which almost imperceptibly resemble each other - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek pads and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making diplomatic reports classified as secret through the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from 30 portraits of what someone with these genomic data might look like, has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on the identity of these interpretations.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie, in which Manning apparently sits unwell in a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette trunk and gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
“They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article,” Dewey-Hagborg said in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to take a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letter friends, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, “Suppressed Images,” which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea’s judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong about the opening of the exhibition now, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further flare up the rigid divisions he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that “things happen for a certain reason.”
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) demanded an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-footer of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific lexicon) to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on view.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, stored in its own room, is a page from the aforementioned comic novel.
She shows Manning showing up with a hands-free phone in her hand from the United States disciplinary barracks like King Kong.
“If they keep your speech cold, they won,” it says.
“Never keep your mouth.”
“It came straight from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulators, who gather together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Manning's stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
“In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind their liberation.”
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University wanted for killing
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are being sought after suspects after a man was stabbed with fatal injuries in a luxurious Chicago apartment.
On Monday, warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as evidenced by the Cook County District Court files.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community warning system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stings as murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now on leave and was excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
“This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation,” Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that “we are in contact with the police in the UK and willing to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any way possible.”
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to show up.
Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi of the Chicago Police Department said he urged the suspects to face the authorities.
“The police have an idea of where they reside, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to residents: “Police are currently working on the victim’s timeline and background, exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
"We will complete the WADA timetable in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) were implemented.
“At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA timetable has been updated in this regard," Mutko said Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA, which was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give cause for concern for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we won’t admit something that doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
Smirnov admitted problems from the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the WADA doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Authority (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is “moving in the right direction” to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was reported by the corporate groups.
It is a pure precautionary measure, it can no longer be assumed of any health impairment, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs may be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negatively for fipronil-containing anti-lice agent.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The Startups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of her employees in their e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or even worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn’t trust the process.
“There just never was consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called for help from outside.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employee anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the board directly.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where’s the Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a company heat map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so you can track why.
Companies come to realize that you have to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so you don’t become the next Uber to get involved in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could hold more than $118.7 billion in value in 2020, according to financial website Let’s Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw rising interest and activity in discredit earlier this year amid the Uber case.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized “puls” surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of their problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has captured the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to be treating its employees badly or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee fluctuation, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company’s headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope he or she was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s general counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, issues previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states — such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices — can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience,” said Vitrano, head of Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical breaches by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the “social media came to their right” that companies realized they couldn’t prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research showing that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just investments.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of the workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn’t come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on data collection.
"For if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you take care of it?
And who do you not care about, why should I?”
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the issues due to the speed of decision making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always getting new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better employee retention in an industry known for high sales.
“If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It’s about 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players chat on one side of the team’s new practice fields on campus.
Some have stripped off their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer classes will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 the next morning.
"That's a real treadmill for the guys for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
That’s why the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7:15 p.m. to meet the players’ already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp nearly a week after last season and performed practical exercises for the first time during summer school during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises in the course of August, 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their kick-off against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA rule change, even if it adds another point to players’ busy routes.
“We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
“And they just pushed it through, they just keep getting around, they’re great people.
I think as soon as we get through Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is over, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of its fields from an adjoining parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been tossed with footballs clearing a protective net behind a gate post.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
“It’s a real problem, and it’s not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then getting ready to record an exercise there.
If you have the video tape from an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces at parking lot 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect potential misreports and send them to fact-checkers who may be showing fact-check results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe it has also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential elections, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings like before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-check will be launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to recognizing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its more recent past, Little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaar Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says grievingly.
“What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.”
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward, documenting the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not the first book by Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’ in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
“I only responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins,” he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there himself.
I love archives!”
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is backed by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for nearly four months (“To be honest, I overrated my welcome greeting a little”), all this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said, 'Oh, throw it into the attic.'"
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that two families fought for.
Guys, let everything go its way!”
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
“There is a record of an uprising that occurred at the castle in 1380 in this book titled ‘Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex’,” Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two of them are connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', depicting 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Scotney's favorite Rhodes family: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks, making debts over and over again and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women – I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a talent to promote heirs.”
After the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic book about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave again,” he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Mary Chapel in Rhöndorf concealed
With the covering of the 301-year-old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau von Donnerstag).
By Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, the highlight of the campaign will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Isn’t it?”, ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel.
“We don’t really think that (of course!),” they write on their website, which was unlocked yesterday.
"But we're using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we firmly believe that as Bad Honnefer citizens we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than “just” a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique selling point."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can taste its new umbrella brand and the campaign for a medium five-digit amount.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises on pensions and promotions in the officer corps.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building as before, but in the Prime Minister’s office.
Under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, the five Vice-Premiers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government takes on the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the lead in the coup attempt.
486 people alleged to have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt a "gift of God" because it gave him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Discomfort in the military headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the lifting of the ban on headscarf for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the military and the security forces continue to do great cleansing.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7,395 state officials fired, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were formerly considered to be the real lords of the country.
Three times they put together, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military’s power step by step, not least by referring to the reform objectives of the European Union.
Former officials say Erdogan is targeting an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the "Vocal Europe" magazine, an unnamed officer who sought asylum abroad after the coup attempt for fear of persecution warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
Anyway, after the cleansings, there are doubts in the Alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army to deploy.
Leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weakened,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington Changes Rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules on obtaining visas for temporary work permits, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and it will do so by changing the way the U.S. is issuing green cards to citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
“This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to renovate route for Rennsteigshuttle
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of controversy about the future of the Rennsteig shuttle – now it’s about to go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, construction will be planned on the rough route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track is expected to begin later this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, which is especially important for tourism," Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl said on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros.
Of this amount, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalized, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the South Thuringian Railway as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
"This negotiates the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards," said Sühl.
The proposed contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the Rennsteig shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular train connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig train stations, especially among tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also partially degraded.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just as you thought it couldn’t get even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming up.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its nipple shape and the type of fingernail.
“People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of them, and we’ll get to see them even more often,” Sharkey said in the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more troubling as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is tailored to your personality as best as possible,” True Companion’s website said.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn’t like what you don’t like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, fixed on conversation, or she may be "in the mood"!"
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots — not least because they replace real human relationships — but the submissive feminine traits, the allusions to rape, when you step closer to Frigid Farrah, worry you most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
“If women can have a vibrator, why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they nevertheless remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture.
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women’s rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who boasts of sexually assaulting women.
The most deterrent aspect of the television series The Handmaid's Tale is not the graphic images, the engulfed bodies and the stabbed eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but right now it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are gracious slaves.
Or to put it in the words of 2017: maid
Trump’s Great Performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a crux of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the United States advising on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s voting relatives.
We all allegedly push ourselves to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less has been noticed of Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been dealing with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite oddly on the same side.
Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but I notice in a further context that this also carries significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the creepy possibility that one day his fairy tales will no longer repulse us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness compared to his standards.
I find myself nowadays infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s hilarious version of the crazy – the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which actually appear to be very mild crimes compared to Trump.
If Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only has to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars to spend in the city when you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are knurled and the animals twist to look frightened over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the flickering music conveys this in strange ways.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage – the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn’t count – but a large roundabout in northern London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can walk on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but luckily nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood smiling while I tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left the prison for a second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treating cuts to his wrists, which he suffered after a case in his cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against a first murder sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius, which they say is too forgiving.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the dismissal students will go to high school in the future, four to Real school.
School principal Angelika Sitte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle, who grows up in the chicken farm, but then is released to freedom.
To this end, the courageous group performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Farm".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken crumbled, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and vanished.
Afterwards, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank’s induction.
The hens danced with the young goggles carrying cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chickens), but belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
Its purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader to feel welcomed in his new school.
This was followed by a thanksgiving to the colleagues, the former school principal Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in in case of school shortages, and the parents’ representatives.
The chicken age is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She is very reluctant to release her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth-graders.
At the end, all students sang a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, cited by television.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegally camping people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested in Sithonia by police.
They were released the same day while an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose significant fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What People Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust performance of cars of the Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro 4 diesels or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives the following ratings:
Is the new action compulsory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have scam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Its retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Motor Vehicle Agency (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has advised to write to each affected person.
If an inspection is required, it will be done within their framework.
How long are the changes expected to take overall?
“Difficult to say,” Smetanin said.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as the political pressure.
"We have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the issue of the environment so far."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Probably would follow foreign manufacturers, according to Smetanin.
Is there a massive price drop for Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.
Singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honored this year.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the awards ceremony together with his wife Melania.
For this reason, the award-winning progressive TV series Lear has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
“This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even deprive them of the means – and that burdens me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Former award winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s city builder, will retire next year.
The position is already advertised - however, suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And he still enjoys the work, as he communicates in the press interview.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
Thus, with due regard to the regular termination deadlines, there should still be enough time for an introduction.
Since Haslach acts as the lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding degrees.
This function will definitely keep the city.
If they could no longer fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports of a good operating climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several important projects have accumulated that Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is confident about the construction office and its employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the remodeling of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, have started.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium refurbishment is still the subject.
The latter alone will be worth around 1.5 million euros, “if we do it right,” Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun.”
There is a lot of room for a city planner.
With Haslach’s own building yard and nursery, many things can be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, stresses the departing city architect.
In any case, the city planner bears a high level of responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end everything runs over my table."
He can count on long-standing employees for support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (high construction) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (underground construction) has been there for 15 years.
Also, that his successor stays for a long time, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the place and wants to stay."
Continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you wish to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to have completed your studies as a diploma engineer or bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of building planning and construction law.
The City Building Office is responsible for construction and civil engineering, building management planning, land procurement matters, management of urban properties, municipal farm with building yard and urban gardening, as well as the Lower Building Law Authority including monument protection.
Bicycle tossed on lines: South railway line locked
According to police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had threw the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so badly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators start from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours.
A pink scooter and a bicycle driver were observed near the scene of the crime.
"This goes far beyond a whimsical blow," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility, as well as the delayed minutes and the cost of rail replacement traffic, the perpetrators could also be paid by the rail customers.
Overall, we can expect a “significant” sum, the spokesman said.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, and rail transport on the South Railway route could be carried out without impediments.
Nearly ten passenger trains had failed Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 meters of cables had to be replaced.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, affecting around 1.3 million in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had of these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environments if the same system works in humans as well.
Postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the gut microbiomes of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six species of bacteria were found to be present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria impacted the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-milky acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" to Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea’s 40-million-pound signature began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid kicked off on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues’ pre-Asian tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of meeting three of its four priority new commitments.
“Three out of four, I thank the club for that,” he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve put a lot of effort into it.”
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and pulled in the form of a dreamliner over the U.S., which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New downfall for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
When Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of the SPD, Social Democratic prime ministers were always looking to Berlin with some concern before the elections.
There was only no disturbance from the party headquarters, just no counterwind from the confederation - that was the most important wish of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching with increasing appallation the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals.
What Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was a downfall.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the Red-Green majority in Lower Saxony, the CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
“This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot reliably govern,” said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising departure of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the parliamentary elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition of the CDU and the FDP.
Federal Greens CEO Michael Kellner has called on the apostate Lower Saxon Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the voters.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate,” said the Federal CEO and campaign leader of the Greens to the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true at all," sighs one SPD-electoral fighter, when on Friday morning the new job message reaches the party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the transition of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU without his own government majority.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, the comrades at that time calmed down.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was the case, and everything got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to mumble, the Düsseldorf-Pleite smoothly killed the party.
In the weeks afterwards, the comrades were eagerly revived.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, the G20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next downfall.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country leader, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong in crisis communication afterwards.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gas affair and his role on the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been under criticism for a long time.
Miserable survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely for this reason, Weil has been increasingly trying to put accents in the federal government in recent weeks.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden by comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to do so because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because there is basically no fault in the party-internal dispute of the Greens in Lower Saxony.
Not Schulz at all.
In the meantime, the comrades endeavour to keep their ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
“It is unbearable and detrimental to democracy how Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else,” says Matthias Miersch, head of the party’s left in the SPD Bundestag faction, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but because of the list of the Lower Saxon Greens, the Lower Saxon MEP continued.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD’s parliamentary group, complains of an “undemocratic maneuver”.
“The voters’ will four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil prime minister,” Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag election, told the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of future CDU deputies distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments by the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for the town centre III
Anyone who wants to renovate his house that has been in the years can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At the time, in rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the State of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the total funding.
In rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to also promote interior development, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On April 4th, the Karlsruhe Presidium of the Government received information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 euros would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a rehabilitation area created?
Schindler continues to investigate where the “real old” houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to rehabilitate.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country program "Social City", within the framework of which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per plot.
The restructuring area would then be defined as a statute.
The granting period for the grants will run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, by September of this year, the inventory would be carried out, within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area will be given a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, if possible, the statute decision should be made so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each commune had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is a matter of assessing the urban problems and deciding when and to what extent they will be rehabilitated.
A refurbishment notice will then be entered in the land register for the respective land.
Pietzschmann himself would come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the stakeholders.
For this reason, there will be questionnaires that will be sent by post to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Landsheet", which is concerned, among other things, with the construction condition and the intentions for renovation.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Household and Housing sheet", information on the size, division and inhabitants of a living space can be made.
The blue "business sheet" is only to be completed if the building operates business premises.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "wind dog principle" - whoever comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
At the end, still photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown, in order to make a renovation "tasty" for those present.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetician at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on homes and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
White House Advertising Costs Taxpayers Thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to the military’s information left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was exhibited alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin firefighter and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
“I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility,” the HMX-1 commander wrote on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at 3 p.m. on July 17 at around 7 a.m. for the event, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction of service hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit’s security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
“One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” he wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," replied the deputy commander.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president pushed for the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use it for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential aircraft performed taxi services in the background of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the presidential aircraft’s use by its predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made in America' show - which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers with American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to dismiss the U.S. president in the White House with precise inch sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted as the flight crew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for "Non-Presidency Support Missions".
The White House said taxpayers took the burden on none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the U.S. Department of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
“Determining the cost to taxpayers based on estimates of reimbursement rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things this week that are made in America,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasize that.”
It wasn’t clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he stepped on his South Lawn tour for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a firefighter car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky’s representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before a tricky task
The top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga competes in the third round of the table of Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the table trimester Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five matches, the leader of the Second Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality.
Team boss Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
“This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
Especially in the rear positions, I think the team is very good."
The imports from the high north ensure class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles,” says Zay with Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all of Denmark).
“It’s going to be difficult for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck.”
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for Blue-White could be Maxime Janvier.
If the currently active Frenchman in the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga party, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing in the tournament in the Czech Liberec comes to his first bet this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He was expected to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still number one on the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay will fill up the squad.
How America Can Harm OMV
Donald Trump did not look really happy when he signed Wednesday night under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia.
“In his haste to pass the law,” Congress had packed in a few “constitutional unlawful regulations,” he added.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US push.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, since then, investors of the local OMV, which co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies, have been concerned.
The threat is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
There are 12 weapons to choose from.
"The press" looked at what the company could repel and which could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be in the spotlight in the Netflix hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar’s killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first receiving its first trailer and showing the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the daycare lunch table itself.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the city day care centers, the clock is turned back.
On September 1st, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the city’s children’s day care facilities (Kitas) again in its own right.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Welfare, this is good news: "We were all very pleased".
A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked, chilled products.
The city operates 46 daycare centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Now, not only children who are cared for for 45 hours per week eat lunch at the daycare center," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies to 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from 1 September: they heat the food delivered, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, spend the food, clear, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"Employees are permanently assigned to a daycare center," Pommeranz says.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the length of the hour.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the daycare team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for daycare management to implement pedagogical concepts."
That’s what it’s all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
“The children should help prepare food.”
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
“They have a known power in daycare, a person they know, and not constantly changing people.”
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the daycare rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning personnel.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical for the city in the cost comparison between self-direction and third-party award, the press office says.
And that, even though 46 part-time staff are being rehired.
"But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in the educational field," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan Democracy Depends on Women's Political Role, Says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will run for the council elections in the provinces. Three women run for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council elections and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process coinciding with the transition from international combat operations to a consultative role.
This year the elections will be peacefully handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan independent election commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered out of a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men called the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstraße, at around 2:55 p.m., because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl’s phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl’s phone and necklace, but it failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
Investigations are underway.
GMB Concerns About Investments in the McVitie Factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to check with managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million over the past few years.
He added that employees and union representatives would “know first” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company’s branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie’s urged “to express concern that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward.”
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising costs of living and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie.”
A Pladis spokeswoman said: “The head of the Tollcross branch received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued engagement with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business – and this applies to all of our business areas and locations – to remain competitive.
She added, “Over the past few years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility, and should our operations change at the site, our employees and their union representatives will be the first to know this.”
Did PSG Barcelona warn about Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not slow down in her pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window this summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
After the end, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, offering wages of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG president about this prospect three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG’s best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players signed with them, that will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International to leave Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to property of over 200 euros.
The Schramberg police, telephone 07422/27 01-0, asks for clues.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car on his lane met him, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and touched the guideboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was en route towards Leese with his VW on the B 215 from Stolzenau at around 7.55 a.m.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a car met him on his lane, so that he had to dodge to the right.
The Touran driver touched the board.
The car was damaged.
The driver of the coming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter paying vehicle to contact the commission in Stolzenau at tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen Report Relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
Author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to generate discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former bishop of Regensburg and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly benefit the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their misapprehension of events at the time.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized the fact that reporting on violence in the cathedrals was measured by "two measures".
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but the "grade of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal,” Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food."
She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a very normal educational means" to "cope with naughty children, as I was one".
It would find it unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger also often appeared.
Completely wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the memorial book "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly stands in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedrals were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 cathedrals were sexually abused.
The final report states about Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "It can therefore be summarized that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence were used by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, it is noticeable that many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even connect positive memories with him.
In an interview, Hesemann explains why he believes the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidences of Violence Exercise on Protected Persons at the Regensburg Cathedral Spats" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize their “humanity”.
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became handy when a Domspatz did not bring top performance musically.
How do you, as his biographer, rate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
There are only eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of co-offender or co-acquaintance in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence in the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of effect.
At best, you can accuse him of not having learned about it too late or of not taking the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was felt by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his pupils give Georg Ratzinger an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbursts of anger.
The fact that he not only banged with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also spread punches and too naughty guys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
To his honour, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you also know of such methods of punishment?
Of course, I think of each of us who were born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the horrendous sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, this is, of course, trivial.
One already wonders if it has more to do with his fame and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just rushed on him.
Many who have never understood the Bavarian Pope are still working eagerly.
But the truth is: The report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the context of the report, a lot has been reported on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedrals.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be blamed in the final report for any involvement or co-involvement with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," one affected person, representing the others, said, "It was all very embarrassing for me."
The real problem with investigating sexual abuse was and still is that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir conductor who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional way.
How, then, do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger’s role in terms of abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: One student interviewed put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator in question.
I also think it is really absurd to assume that boys have opened up more intrusively or more clearly or rather than to their parents, boarding school managers, trust teachers, etc.
Talking to him about sex is unthinkable.”
Thus, the report comes to the very clear result: "That the pupils concerned and/or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must therefore be acquitted of any co-assurance.
He cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to justice.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read of "voltage" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That is the big problem that everything in the reporting has been mixed and mixed into a huge mixture of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
This, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation: between the preschool and the high school of the cathedrals, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were really harassed and abused by sadistic teachers and suffered horrificly, all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have ruled.
But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he did not see the boys until they were already at Domspatzengymnasium.
On it, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.
They were just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even connect positive memories with him".
At most, there is the accusation of looking away.
But despite all efforts, the report was only able to define two periods in which he was told about the conditions in preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just started to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he just did not work and was responsible, (the witness) did not want to hear anything, and only then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
He said: "The punishment of beatings will continue to be practiced in preschool.
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were long forbidden in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal grey zone, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the persons concerned might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had actually been exceeded.
But you can’t say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the punishment of beatings at schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the “fall-strike of anachronism”, that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today’s moral standards.
The princess is right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abominable at all times, and also not to what was committed in preschool in the face of revolt and violence against innocent children’s souls, that goes far beyond what was then usual.
It’s all terrible and I’m glad it’s finally worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw whips and to the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg era did Georg Ratzinger then reproduce in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did this issue also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, the cathedrals played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal by any means that he led a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form from the hitherto more nationally known Regensburg Cathedral Spats an institution of world rank, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and candies alone, rebellious boys are not great singers and face any success, no matter in which field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger during the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and I experienced him again and again as wonderful, humorous, kind, deeply believing and good-hearted people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could hurt even a fly.
I regularly get to see how many former cathedral pats still today, 23 years after his emeritus, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who have not forgiven him to this day that he was once strict to them are clearly in the minority.
Most cathedrals today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a loving person of respect to whom they still look up today and who they worship.
And please, again, it is very clear: all that is accused of him are methods of education that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time a long time ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would order a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merits and without that outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany no one would know the Regensburg Cathedrals, to finally leave in peace.
