Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his rapid response.
The driver misses the biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left on the Landesstraße 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim with her VW from Merklingen at around 9.30 a.m.
She oversaw the 24-year-old motorcyclists who were entitled to drive from Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away in the event of a collision
The biker tried to dodge the car, but still streaked it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the striping process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to slow down.
He steered his motorcycle in the green ribs next to the roadway and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker sustains leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury at the Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest aids infected
After a corona mass infection at a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and are not allowed to leave the plant.
A security service monitors the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the corona-causing agent Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as announced by the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already become infected in the plant - this was the reason for the row test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - but the cucumbers only for inserts.
Mamming is a rural community with more than 3,300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people".
On the yard, infected people were separated from non-infected staff and the site is now surrounded by a fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting control of the shelters of seasonal workers.
“This can take bitter revenge when such local infections have to take over and regional lockdowns have to be ordered,” said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD looks very similar: "After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program also for farms with harvest aides," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"Especially the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be carefully monitored from our point of view.
This obviously didn’t happen.”
The outbreak came with “announcement.”
Aidenbachstraße subway station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser
During a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, a 19-year-old fell by a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, a dispute between two youth groups broke out at the Aidenbachstraße subway station at around 4.15 p.m.
A passenger alarmed the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old man to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man climb out of the track.
There was no danger due to an incoming track.
According to the police, there were later again clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old fled the scene at first, but his personal data could be determined in hindsight.
In the company of his father, he went to Police Inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for personal injury.
Report: Seehofer urges long-term data retention
The storage of data is currently suspended.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period, according to a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data - instead of the planned ten weeks - for a half-year, according to a media report.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter asked for a swift change in the law.
Seehofer wants to step up measures against child abuse.
He believes it is sensible to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law already now," the newspaper quoted from the letter.
The storage of data is currently suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected.
But Seehofer wants the changes already in advance so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Justice Ministry told the newspaper that it was only sensible to examine whether legal adjustments were needed if the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already voted for data storage in June.
NBA: Strip Club Trouble for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), a basketball professional with the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he visited the nighttime strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit, is back in Isloation and is being tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou," as he is called in the NBA, already expressed his love for these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d.R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA has ordered a 10-day quarantine for Williams.
The Clippers star thus misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams are preparing with training matches for the season finale starting the night on Friday.
Söder speaks out after mass infection on coronavirus
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the Dingolfing-Landau district has shocked authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm nearly 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working, with over a third infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is locked off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the site, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free corona tests to the more than 3,300 residents of the community.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience bites": Confession of the alleged firefighter of Nantes
“My client has been cooperative,” lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the deeds very much, confession was a liberation for him."
"His mandate is plagued by conscience bites and carried very much by the extent of the destruction."
In the event of a conviction, the man is threatened with ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged in a fire on the night of Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in three far apart places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect was arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the eye of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the European Commission creates completed facts," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous to Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one does not get around the debate, whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors in associations that want to break into this phalanx."
But he doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participation, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of moving investment fences around the Bundesliga business location in a European single market," Grindel said.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that “attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship.”
Even an equal distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
FC Bayern has sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million euros and RB Leipzig of 300 million euros.
So the differences between the first three clubs alone are already immense.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old said.
Looking back at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said of the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
“It has already occupied me humanly.”
He received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a compliance breach, and it was right to draw the consequences from it,” Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I handled it completely transparent and harmlessly.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it.”
He never made “a hiding place out of the gift,” the 58-year-old assured.
"It may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and One Dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have escalated due to Donald Trump’s use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday there were clashes between protesters and police officers in various cities.
In Louisville, three people were injured, and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was shot dead while a demonstration train was just crossing a crossroads.
Previously, clashes had taken place in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
Security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly separated protesters.
Hundreds, partly armed protesters marched through Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor’s death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot in March in a drug raid at her Louisville home.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found either.
When a member of a group calling himself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a gunshot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because counter-protesters had also formed a white militia.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and died during a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
Police said they had taken a suspect into custody.
So far, she has not given any details on the circumstances of the act.
Mayor Steve Adler told The New York Times that he, like many in the city, was "discouraged and shocked" by what had happened.
Also in the American metropolis of Seattle, protesters clashed with police on Saturday.
They set fire to a construction car in front of a juvenile prison, the police used blending grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resistance to police officers or bodily injury.
In Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters slammed into windows, shot fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday evening.
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital injured.
In addition, windows were slammed in a courtroom and a fire was set, as the police reported.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sause was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy-Ball or Festzug are burning, many came to their expense with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
“I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy flair,” says Kurdirektor Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have welcomed it well.
In principle, one goes back to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical ones were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been always attending the Rakoczy festival in Bad Kissingen for more than 25 years.
This time in the Corona year.
The couple made it easy at the Luitpold casino, watched the history while strolling and listened to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it very pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She misses the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
However, it lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic festival and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year,” she said.
Rakoczy riding tournament to be held again
For the performers of the historic spa guests, the alternative program meant partly more work.
For example for Christina Gold, who participates in the festival in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the spa garden cafe.
This year she was walking around the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costumes.
"It's already more exhausting, otherwise we have it easier," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even though individual riders were on the way in the park.
"We very much hope that the riding squadron can take place again next year," says chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will be held again.
28 Corona cases against Spanish second-league Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football league CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer flew from near Madrid to the city of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on July 20, despite the first Corona cases, one low hit follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one of whom was admitted to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid has so far had a chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the descent to the B-group of the Second League threatens.
The match against Deportivo La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, the senior sports authority CSD is considering the forced descent of the club.
The players and other team members are sitting in a quarantine hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel or gel," the sports newspaper AS wrote.
Photos show players hanging underwear and club clothes in their rooms at the hotel for drying after apparently having to wash them themselves.
The bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
It is neither good nor sufficient, he wrote “AS”.
The club management, however, informed that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The allegation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
They did not violate the Corona rules established by the football association, stressed the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before departure, there were four infected by July 19, but all of them were isolated and did not travel.
Just before the flight to A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, there were “five or six” other team members of the Corona test.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the start, said Tebas Llanas.
Police must catch horses torn out of steam compartment
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, shortly before 6 a.m., a road user informed two free-running horses on the feeder between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld mouth and the Theres highway terminal.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the officers gained the confidence of the horses shortly before Steamfach, they were allowed to turn a rope carried in the police cart.
Cycling pro Tony Martin: career continuation possible
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is considering a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time time-racing world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
“I’m currently working with the team on the framework conditions for how and in what form it could continue,” the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after the Corona break this year.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Once upon a time he got up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the wheel.
Today, as a father of a little daughter, I think: What if?
The cyclist admitted that there are aspects with which he is increasingly difficult.
“But it was good for me to see what I have in cycling and how much fun I have with it from the Corona time.”
At the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August) the time trial specialist will once again enter the competition.
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria’s streets this weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the tour ends deadly by motorcycle.
An 18-year-old pedestrian is also dying.
Schönthal - Several people, mostly young people, died in accidents on the streets of Bavaria over the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was caught on Saturday in Schönthal (Country Cham) by a car that came on the countertrack.
Why the car hit the track was unclear at first.
In Upper Bavaria on Saturday, a 22-year-old collided with a horse carriage on his machine.
According to the police, he was on his way downhill at Beilngries.
In a left corner, he hit the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve passengers in the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man slightly injured, police said.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old man died in the Upper Palatine Bad Kötzting.
He had been lying on a road on Sunday night and was overrun by a 42-year-old driver.
According to police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau district) on Saturday, a 57-year-old biker hit a car in a right corner despite full braking.
He died at the accident site.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the remaining three people in the car remained unharmed.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria’s Minister of Transport Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against driving bans announced in August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister pointed to extensive investments such as underride protection on guideboards and the decommissioning of dangerous curves.
"For the safety of motorcyclists, we have achieved a lot in recent years," the letter said.
“The number of motorized two-wheelers killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011.”
Kovac to test with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will host the Hesses, the former club of Croatia, on 1 August (18:00).
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only hard test before the return in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting is held without spectators.
“We are especially looking forward to this game.
It’s always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,” Kovac explained.
This is an interesting test, the 48-year-old said.
Before moving to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led to a victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-profile opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again,” said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had taken over the succession of the Croat at the Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters lost the eighth-final in-game game against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Nearly 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof just past the lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known new corona infections on the weekend has increased further: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person is recovered and no longer falls into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the city court.
As a result, the Hof area is approaching the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a week.
700 killed in monsoon rain in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people were killed due to the heavy monsoon rain.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent tries to reach the isolated people in boats.
Whole villages are underwater.
Farmers have lost their crops.
Tank horns in national park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank horns died by landslides.
They are protected and deemed to be endangered.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which is attributable to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm also continues in Grenezn.
Anyone who used to own a house, even though it was so small and like a hut, often does not want to spend his life in a large residential block.
Many homes are empty, but, as the government wants, they will soon be taken in by those who have lost their homes due to the floods.
60 new corona infections in just one day in Vienna
In the 24-hour comparison, 60 new corona infections were reported in Vienna - in Lower Austria there were 22 new infections.
The State Health Directorate Vienna and the Medical Crisis Staff of the City of Vienna regularly inform about the current case numbers and other key figures on the Covid-19 virus: as of Sunday, 26 July 2020, 8.00 a.m., 4,840 (+60) positive tests have been confirmed in Vienna.
The number of deaths related to the virus is 204 unchanged.
4,090 (+48) people are recovered.
22 new coronavirus infections in Lower Austria

A patient has recovered, according to the medical staff.
This increases the number of recoveries to 2,936.

So far, 147,253 tests have been carried out.
105 people died from lung disease.
Argentina rejects counter-offering by creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires said on Saturday.
“This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair,” it said in a statement.
“While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors.”
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer viable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is calling on its private creditors to waive some of its claims of around $66 billion (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country threatens to collapse again.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government remains on its latest offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate last was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power of around ten percent.
By the end of May, Argentina had failed to settle interest claims of $503 million, resulting in a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"It's going super well" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary office.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctorate lawyer started the work, the normal day-to-day business is long gone on full tours.
"I still have to arrive privately," she explains in a conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time was of course not enough to shift the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native dingo finger.
Currently, she and her husband, who is working in Regensburg as a judge in the district court, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for short-term parental leave in order to be able to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also had an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course been a term for her for a long time.
During local visits with her family in recent months, she again found: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she did the race in the selection process for the free position.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career also played a central role in her homeland of Lower Bavaria: After studying law in Passau, she completed her referendum period and the 2nd state exam in Regensburg.
After several posts as a notary-assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Lower Allgäu region and Regensburg - during this time she also trained "besides" her doctorate in labour law - she took her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went on parental leave, eventually moving to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notary offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised for Lutz Feller’s approaching retirement, she saw the right time for full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has immediately a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It is going super well!"
The fact that she can rely here on intricate processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
She has already contacted a local institution in relation to kindergartens and nativity scenes.
And if everything goes as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon too - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent filled for the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory, we are planning to have 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund Managing Director Carsten Cramer to the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games caused by the corona pandemic last season, the BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at the BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the account if these revenues are completely broken".
In the face of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side length first."
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-term work, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer said.
Dortmund’s chief marketing officer praised the BVB professionals for their relinquishment of salaries, which is meant to contribute to overcoming the crisis: “Of course, players know that their relinquishment of salaries has a different effect than when we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-term work.”
Tiny Miracles: Early Start with a Few Hundred Grams
Hardly heavier than a Packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Grazer Kinderklinik.
A quarter of them weighs less than 1,500 grams, a few — like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael — are extreme lightweight with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that it could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they wouldn’t be at the voice – “and how,” smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard Becomes the Stage
Despite the Corona theater in the classroom, the whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Saint James Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the holidays began.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the theater of the city of Aalen presented the production "The Home Dress" to the students - and this via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange the play and the performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of teaching.
Even if at the end all the participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional stimuli, you can also see in the theatre the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, it could be an interesting addition to the game operation," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: The TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup are set.
The lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualifying round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD-Sportschau.
Due to the corona pandemic, the participant field is not yet complete, so placeholders were used during the draw.
By the voluntary renunciation of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If second-league runner-up Würzburg reaches the final, sixty would already be fixed for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise the Giesinger would have to win in the final game against regional league player Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will take place between September 11 and 14, one week before the start of the third league.
Olivia de Havilland has died
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland has died.
She died in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104 of a natural death, her spokeswoman confirmed to the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was best known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southeastern epic "From the Wind" (1939).
Born as a child of British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theaterman Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of the Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night Dream".
The film studio Warner Brothers took her under contract for seven years and brought her out big alongside Eroll Flynn.
Eight movies she shot with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Motherheart".
Three years later, the award came as best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress."
She also received much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Cave".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her in 1952 for the lead role in the filming of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her longtime girlfriend Bette Davis, she played in "Cradle Song for a Corpse".
From the marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss comeback final
The World Cup seconds Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they underwent their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semi-finals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome last September.
In the final game on the Rhine, their defeator Ehlers/Flügen defeated the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played at the beginning of September in Timmendorfer Strand: The tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz eruption from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, in the view of the FDP, only a “fig leaf” and does not change the character of the party.
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," FDP interior policymaker Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of trial the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD-Fraktion in the Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD were really to consistently remove right-wing extremists from its party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," Strasser said.
"There is no political will in the AfD, however, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything," he told the "Welt am Sonntag".
“It speaks rather volumes, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD.”
Blume expects that the AfD will again land below 5% in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the speakers of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD country and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the flow as a "secure right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD Federal Board had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz did not indicate a previous membership in the now prohibited right-wing "Haustreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and with the Republicans at his entry into the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without caliber.”
Neither the federal party nor the right wing is weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen-Truppen is clear.
You want to avoid another observation by the constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not let go of the ghosts that they called.
An exit does not change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD secretary general Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the faction remained their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute over the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver 21 percent more electricity
Wind power plants in the German North Sea have supplied 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity to the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21% increase compared to the same period last year, the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth said.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet grid area, have supplied a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea thus reaches 13.73 TWh, compared with a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due to higher generation capacities in addition to wind conditions, as new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full power, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing €20 billion in the expansion of offshore network connections by then," said Tim Meyerjürgens, Managing Director of Tennet.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce approximately 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a little celebration of the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew up the usual frame after the corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was supplied by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the club "Sandtogether" was engaged.
Freital: Windbergfest canceled due to Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival scheduled for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - in the awareness of how difficult it is economically for the parties involved - hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partisan).
"But ultimately, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here as an organizer."
Because if tens of thousands had flown to the festival grounds and into the festival tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking according to the current corona protection regulation could not have been observed.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not be much left of a popular festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring burden would increase disproportionately many times.
Rumberg took care of next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Saxony Day from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic winner Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories over the weekend with four starts.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with consecration gold and Quantaz each, she was also not to beat on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the short.
At the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday in the special.
Also in the short run, the German on Quantaz on Saturday was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old pupil Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first short story ever.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth won all four major competitions.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms
The University of Worms continues to go into the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" grants a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to enable the beginning of the study not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities at both the university and at the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy are used equally.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been trained as an air traffic controller at Worms University of Applied Sciences in the course of study Air Traffic Management.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lodging training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the lodging profession.
"In these times, it is not easy for us to support economically.
However, we firmly expect that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proofing investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Applied Sciences Worms, also underlines this: "The foundation professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor’s program Air Traffic Management”.
The confidence of the German Aviation Safety Agency is both a motivation and a commitment for the University of Worm to further develop its teaching and research competence in the future fields of aviation.
In deploying for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first foundation professorship for a dual degree program.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, stresses: "Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique position in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on aviation.
Today’s signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university.”
Rescue helicopter landing on the A 45
Around 30 minutes on Saturday noon, the A 45 motorway was completely closed in the direction of Aschaffenburg, because after a traffic accident the rescue helicopters were in use.
A 76-year-old drove straight ahead in a Ford at around 12.40 a.m. at the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the corner and landed on the board.
As a result of the impact, the front airbags were released, the driver suffered minor injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At the moment, however, the police assume that there is no life threat.
The damaged vehicle, which incurred damage of around 2,000 euros, had to be towed.
Salvation wants to test other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Law tightening is imminent.
Are they right, and will they remain?
Federal Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other industries according to the strict regulations against maladies in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers already warn against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation on Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses shall no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel in slaughter, dismantling and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contract workers and temporary workers will be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the DPA: “Finger away from a general restriction of contracts and employee remission if you do not want to completely choke the economy.”
Work contracts, for example, for wide areas of the crafts, the construction industry and plant construction are mandatory the basis for their added value for the customer.
“The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument.”
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts anywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts make sense.
“If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, that’s a normal contract.”
The German meat industry considers a ban on labor contracts and temporary work in its industry alone to be unconstitutional.
It is unexplainable why in the future the portioning and packaging of cheese should apply different labour law than for sausage, it says in a statement on the draft law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
With a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and per product.
Many Eastern European employees from contracting companies worked in the industry for 16 hours a day, according to the results of an audit by the NRW Labour Protection Administration.
Often they didn’t have a break.
Salary was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the housing of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively tough law came into force for the meat industry as early as 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "tricky constructions".
“Now we need to clean up fundamentally.”
The politician announced: "The Labour Protection Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that affect not only the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates for occupational safety or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The DPA draft includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers’ Rights in the Meat Industry as well as to the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg’s Minister of Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I wish we could do even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transports," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more staffing is also needed for more controls.
Three dead in crash of ultra-light aircraft in Germany
Three people have died in the crash of an ultra-light aircraft on a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to the police.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people were injured in the accident, a spokesman for the Wesel district control station said.
A parachute was found at the scene, police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
More details were initially not known.
The eviction of Frankfurter Opernplatz went peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the opera house at night on Sunday also went peacefully.
Lastly, a few dozen people remained in the square, but left it before the start of the ban at 1 o’clock.
The police had been on duty since the early evening with numerous officials, and there was a larger police order throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, there was a ban on entering the opera house, where there had been riots a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of celebrants.
At least five police officers were injured, several police vehicles damaged.
The night on Saturday was quiet as well.
Car overlaps: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 1.25 p.m.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade was looking for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on the road 83 towards her place of residence Hümme, when her car got off the road from a hitherto unexplained cause and repeatedly overwhelmed herself.
In order to save the casualties, the fire brigade had to clear the roof of the car.
As it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched from the rotary ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the person search.
However, the forces found no one among the tall corn plants.
The severely injured person was taken to the Kassel clinic by ambulance.
Almost 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The highway was blocked for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the club’s history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo hit 1:0 before the half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer pushing away from place one two days before the end of the season of Serie A.
The Inter Milan standings are seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo hit after a free-kick variant with the last action.
A play by Miralem Pjanic, the 35-year-old from the penal zone boundary directly exploited with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2:0, after his shot dusted Federico Bernardeschi (67th).
This ensured the glamorous but decisive success.
The foul-foot meter shot to the bar in the 89th minute was probably only Ronaldo himself, looking at the goal-changer score.
“It’s complicated to stay on ball level mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum is changing very slightly," coach Maurizio Sarri said after a 1:2 with Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the loss, the Torinos had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
The calming lead at the top of the table at the end was due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the match on Sunday, the Sarri team only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will still be the king of goalkeepers is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has hitherto scored 31 goals, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile after his three-pack in the 5:1 (1:1) of the Lazio Rome fourth table at Hellas Verona already has 34 hits in his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus are in the eighth final of the Champions League, but on August 7 they will have to make up a 0:1 in-game bankruptcy against Olympique Lyon to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Despite the threat of penalties and court judgments, drivers continue to give gas to countless illegal races on the roads in Baden-Württemberg: last year and the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although there are no comparative values for the years before, the razors are increasingly working for the judicial authorities: In 2018, the prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim conducted a total of 155 investigations for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as shown by the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously competed against each other or had taken the flight from the police - also this is indicated as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were mostly at the wheel.
113 fines - 15 times imprisoned
Only in comparatively few cases are the razors caught and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been sentenced.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually rising.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before to the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and reported more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
The highway 8 is particularly popular with razors, and drivers always brake the traffic there to make room and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 at Merklingen.
The A81 is the most popular track.
On the A81, the police register more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit, attempts are made to decelerate the razors on the particularly affected section between narrow and geisha.
The mostly high-priced and uplifted sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates because the drivers dodge to lawn in Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few distances: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would get rid of this problem on highways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD's Landtagsfraktion.
"The inhibition threshold for razors would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more."
From enlightenment or image campaigns, Rivoir holds less: "Whoever in such a way overrides all rules and puts not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users at stake, is hardly attainable with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that rasers cannot be deterred from the speed limits," says Holger Bach, head of the Department of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also harsher checks on the affected routes.
From January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in downtown Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men are said to have delivered a car race in November.
One of the vehicles departed from the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained lying on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races over the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, harsher penalties are not necessary: "The need for legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen," says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Blue light from July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack.
There he noticed a man who used the refrigerator with drinks and then left the snack through a previously slammed entrance door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: he is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hoodie, black pants and light shoes.
Further witnesses are being received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling professional Pascal Ackermann has won his second day victory on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate from the Bora-hansgrohe team finished in mass sprint on the 109-kilometre stretch with start and finish in Hermannstadt after winning a stage on Saturday.
It was the season wins three and four for Ackermann.
His Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed in the overall standings.
The 26-year-old had sovereignly decided to ride the mountain time on his own in the morning and thus took the top in the classification.
Only 104 drivers had entered the final stage in the evening.
No fewer than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time driving.
"I'm really happy to start the season restart with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” the 26-year-old said.
300 meters before the finish, he just pulled on his sprint, “and it worked out perfectly.”
In accordance with the rules of the UCI World Association, a corona test was performed on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and caregivers were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
The spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Conductor gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - A tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) was suddenly lying lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call came in shortly before 1 p.m.
"A manager immediately gave instructions for lay reanimation," a fire department spokesman told BILD.
Shortly afterwards, the rescuers took over the revival measures.
The child in danger of life was transported to the hospital under resuscitation.
Why it happened is unclear.
The police routinely began investigations into the accident.
The firefighter spokesman said: "We are assuming a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unapproved tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and, at times, more than 1,000 people took part in a “tuning meeting” on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to intensify control of such events.
A big tuning meeting was held on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Mittelfranken, around 10.30 p.m., the Nuremberg traffic police detected an increased vehicle volume in the area of a large car park in the Ingolstadter Straße.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks.
Just recently, the police announced that they wanted to step up their actions against so-called autoposers.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
Officials counted more than 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people, according to the police.
Of this, however, only a small proportion of those present can be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently the majority of the relevant scene responded to the appeal of the police.
Based on the vehicles and people on the spot, it can be assumed that these were mostly show-goers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the current infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wearing a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at around 1:00 a.m.
Overall, the officials found 10 vehicles undergoing such structural changes that the operating licence had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The Central Franconia Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out intensified control measures, including in connection with the advent of lustful people," it said.
News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the involved towing company: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," said Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to cause damage.
“Young people should finally get their cars back without harming them.”
Employment Agency figures: 900 cases suspected of abuse in short-term work
The Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-term workers’ money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-term work," Daniel Terzenbach, the executive director responsible for the operational business, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the corona crisis, a lot of companies suddenly requested short-term work, the BA had to respond quickly.
The test usually lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
The more we will take a closer look at the final statements.
I'm sure there will be a lot more to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Indications of abuse would often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA analysis software is used to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
Will there be more insolvencies than last year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing for the case and already training our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency payments".
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The gathering had been dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The youngsters then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by repository drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation there are assemblies that do not comply with the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 circumvention regulation.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without corona regulations, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
Storage on the meadows is prohibited according to parking regulations, there are few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more trash and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties, meanwhile, have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after corona eruption in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular tourist town of St. Wolfgang in Upper Austria.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the state authorities in Linz.
There were more than 100 results in the evening.
Accordingly, many of the infected young interns are in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest was tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The lockout time was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Guests also traveled prematurely.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about one-third of guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections became public.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of the interns, who had celebrated in several locales and could have become infected there on Saturday.
“We all enjoyed doing this in our youth,” he told radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young people about the dangers of Covid-19.
As of Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which in the early phase of the pandemic was a center of corona spread throughout Europe.
Overall, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main focuses of new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place on the last day of the Premier League with a 2:0 (0:0) victory against direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League because FC Chelsea were still passing by and qualifying as fourth also for the Royal Class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United went through a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute) in the lead.
After a red card for Leicester City in the postseason, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) finished.
Chelsea, FC Bayern's Champions League eighth-final opponent, won in parallel with Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who still passed the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started as sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for himself, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time for class retention.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately matched Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost to Arsenal with 2:3 (1:3).
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, drops after five years of first league.
As did Bournemouth, who was unable to save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
FC Liverpool, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team barely missed the points record in English football.
The best mark holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the match for Liverpool on Sunday.
"For this wonderful club it was an exceptional season," van Dijk said after the game, "that should inspire us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses will be happy.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from March 13 to June 17.
In the meantime, there was even discussion of a premature termination or a holding of the remaining games on neutral ground.
Eventually, however, the season could be played without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are getting more and more fierce.
During the night there were violent clashes.
Israeli police in Jerusalem on Sunday night violently cracked down on participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water throwers to dissolve the rally.
In total, according to media reports, about 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu’s headquarters on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s dealing with the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew in horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government’s private villa in the coastal town of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying on demonstrators on the roadside from a driving car.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the throat.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of rapid easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has severely aggravated the country’s economy.
The unemployment rate last stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new coronavirus infections in Israel has recently risen to record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A drive-up accident on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen claimed nine light injuries.
A driver was driving with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police said: "Suddenly she was slowing down because she wanted to turn off."
This must have been seen by the driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her too late.
He screamed at the back of the car.
In the accident, three passengers were slightly injured in the car and six in the van.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea blocks border town after Corona suspected
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to fight off the coronavirus as a "luminous success".
This is the first time the country has reported a suspected case.
Due to a first official corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a major city out of fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been brought into the country," state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, a state of emergency was imposed.
The communist leadership called for the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the isolated country.
North Korea has so far not registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "luminous success".
The information was questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reported to have been detected by an "escaper" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for the crossing of the four-kilometre-wide and mostly mined military buffer zone.
South Korea’s military, however, admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea to be high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
Investigations were conducted on some people.
North Korea said on Saturday it had called for an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo under the chairmanship of Kim Jong Un.
“The dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe.”
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others," the statement said.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been placed in quarantine.
Accordingly, the central military commission of the party is to investigate the "outfall" and the behavior of the responsible military unit and impose severe punishment if necessary.
Kaesong is home to an estimated 300,000 people.
Tension before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still to be discussed before big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the housing plan for the large-scale city development project East", says rather casually in the middle part of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
Majorities for this are scarce, most recently in individual committees even rejecting depending on the presence.
After almost ten years of preparation, Reinhard Klein criticized the project’s opponents as “extra-parliamentary opposition”, “unwitting”, “speculation”, “disgusting” and “conscious falsehoods”.
"Everyone thinks they know better," said Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim citizen list for a year.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The city will be cheaper to leave, the Technical City Hall is, contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, whose existence Klein is convinced, to rehabilitate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will evolve quite differently than is predicted in the town hall and on the part of the proponents of the economy.
One day after that, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also provides for the refurbishment of the Technical Town Hall, the openness of the Castle Hill, the rental of the Ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller redesign of the city centre, ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise caused by road traffic, including many temporal reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus of the noise by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned clocks and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
In addition, the accession to the climate pact of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the municipal day-care facilities and the application for inclusion in the smart city funding of the federal government is on the agenda.
Citizens are welcome, but must take care of corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann starts his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31, with nearly a half-year delay.
Before the league of supercars could start regular operation, the first test drives were on.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from starting his first service ride in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygienic conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargen made his first laps on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the pre-season," says Zimmermann.
"With ABS, for example, you have to go differently in the curves.
But it really was a lot of fun.”
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman is already experienced in GT sport despite his only 25 years and has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges,” says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other as dazzling and we made tremendous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
Starting July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serial novices, knows the track though.
In 2015, he was the last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get little used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen race community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to make the most of in order to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann really is, it turns out in two weeks.
“Of course, the teams are playing poker a little bit in the tests,” he says.
"At the end of the day, we are very pleased and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly pressed calendar.
There will be seven races at the beginning of November.
The current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula One driver Niko Hülkenberg will take the GT steering wheel.
British transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government’s decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers after their return for two weeks has caught the country’s transport minister cold, according to press reports.
According to the report, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday the measure.
Due to the rise in corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to return to quarantine.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the scheme applies to those who are only on holiday on the deadline, only from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
In Austria, Spain is considered to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of quarantine for holidaymakers in Spain," said Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps."
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the elimination of the strict exit ban, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists mainly blame the nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday countries of the British.
Unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland is currently not recommended by the British government, which excludes the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus have been registered in Spain and more than 28,000 have died.
Russia: Naval Day: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that he will equip warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons on Marine Day in his country.
These weapons, unique in the world, would expand the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defense also informed the agency of successful tests of the hypersonic missile Zircon built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have multiples of the sound speed of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo will continue to be built
The underwater torpedo Poseidon, which can be atomically equipped, is also being built, it was said.
The planned seed drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also sailed on a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be deployed to the individual fleet associations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces celebrated the day of the navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
There was also fired ammunition.
In a video released by the Ministry of Defense, not only were warships, including a submarine, but also helicopters and fighter jets.
Hurricane 'Hanna' Reaches Texas: Help Gets Difficult Due to Corona
WASHINGTON - This year's first hurricane over the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening flooding, strong winds and heavy rains have now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center told the U.S. climate agency NOAA on Sunday night.
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The corona pandemic in Texas has made the work of helpers more difficult, Abbott said, according to U.S. media.
Evacuees called for caution
“Every hurricane is a huge challenge,” Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
“This challenge is complicated and will be further exacerbated considering it sweeps through an area that is the state’s most covid-19-affected area,” he said.
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott urged people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices “to which we have become accustomed,” such as wearing masks, the governor told CBS.
It is important that everyone keeps a distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
It should also be tested for corona in emergency shelters.
Initially, damage was reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Returned
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit by land on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning had been issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a softening as "Hanna" moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was driving towards Hawaii at night to Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
It is predicted to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday, then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the agency said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given available climate data and higher water temperatures in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, while a below-average is only 10 percent, it said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that his government is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four Goals Lost: Video Assistant "Prisoned" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic lost two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals missed: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening at the 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of unprecedented goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR gone so hard against a team," the Corriere dello Sport commented.
Host Naples had gone through a goal of defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, Filip Djuricic first praised the balance.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) withdrew the match due to an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball again into the net - the VAR attacked again.
The goal of attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) also retracted the referee team on VAR's notice.
In the post-match period Allan made the 2:0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team has done before.
The new technology sets records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparatory phase for the Champions League began for double-winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick "somewhat well" has to think after the first team training, how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most operational minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a band injury at the left foot and threatens to be missing in decisive royal-class duels.
In Munich’s muddy weather, the right-wing defender broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf cart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A bet in the eighth-final rematch against FC Chelsea on August 8 should be difficult, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on August 12 in Lisbon.
The Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the misfortune of training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to showcase his victorious title collectors in the ideal 28 days to the royal-class finale on August 23.
"We simply mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup.
Now we have to create the special thing,” Flick said.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve, however, the eighth-final match against FC Chelsea is first.
After 3-0 in the first game before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not become again the Bayern nightmare like in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build confidence with a good game,” Flick said.
A test to match is set against Olympique Marseille on Friday.
With a long address, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days off after the double, to a one-off August.
He greeted 31 players on Säbener Strasse, including the new players around the noble shopping Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the pitch after moving from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the new ones, has fitted well," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. can no longer just coach, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of training for singles and small groups, team strength is now being trained for the Londoners, who are in the game rhythm as opposed to the Flick ensemble.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-final are Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not quite that easy," stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparations, which is especially important in the 0-to-100 matches.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive feature of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the champions were present, including the emigrant Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the royal-class season is not secured.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to win its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
All American races were cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more and more concrete.
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix, three more race tracks were added during the week.
The race will take place at the Nürburgring in Germany and Portim<0xC3><0xA3>o in Portugal in October.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will compete for World Cup points on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
According to the current status, the 2020 race calendar includes 13 races.
“We are delighted that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the Royal Class of Motorsport will be completed in this exceptional season.
Formula 1 will finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
In front of the officially scheduled races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports say that there could still be performances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulation calls for races on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there will be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing "extraordinary circumstances" because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the looming corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be hosted in America this year.
Rejection comes to criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," Carey said.
The rejection of the American races was particularly criticized in Brazil: "The rejection came as no surprise for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for this," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
Infection rates in the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo area are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify a cancellation.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil look at Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s well-known Latenight show via video chat and told in the interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest at a popular U.S. Latenight show via video switching.
Among other things, she talked about her struggle against the powers of the world.
Also about her famous "bad look" at her encounter with Donald Trump, the teenage girl spoke.
New York City - Over the past two years climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays for Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known Latenight show, she spoke about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight moderator Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg on your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful.
“There are some things that surprised me,” she said.
“How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis,” she said.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children are taking to the streets,” she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her find her “funny” because she shows her reactions “because they have no other answer.”
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter glance behind US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which she sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive look was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, that is, an animated image, which ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert’s relatively open question, she answered only briefly: “To be honest, I don’t think it needs any further explanation.”
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the punchy answer and disappeared laughingly from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe with Bavaria’s Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming the goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional scored three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalty yards in the after-games of both halves.
Thus, the 30-year-old from Table Four has two season games before the end now 34 season goals on his account - just as many Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich scored in the expired Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 30 goals, while the Portuguese superstar met Sampdoria Genoa with the top rider in the evening.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton hailed Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their biggest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for charitable purposes.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems have also played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
There followed a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the picture.
He is said to have lived on the streets for a period of time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
At a young age, he became passionate about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing professional guitar and five years later was given the chance to perform on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly afterwards, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green couldn’t handle the media buzz, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green succeeded surprisingly in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swim without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he restarted in 1996 with a group of musicians.
The Daily Telegraph spoke of a rock star returning to Earth.
With the Peter Green Splinter Group, Green released a few albums until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of recent decades.
