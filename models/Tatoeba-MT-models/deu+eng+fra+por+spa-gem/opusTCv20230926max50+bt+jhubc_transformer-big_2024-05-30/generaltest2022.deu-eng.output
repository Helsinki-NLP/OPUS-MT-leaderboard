I am #PRS_ORG# big customer and so it's not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
In principle, I also think that children should not be encouraged to take on a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big brothers to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let's take a look, let's help, let's bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can be enough children, I don’t see a problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for the short time and it’s OK for him, that’s good.
You can judge for yourself if this is right for your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany for hours while falling asleep.
Purely legally, it is probably questionable.
This may also be the psychologist’s statement.
Because if something really happened like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book.
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and although I can still remember almost the entire plot but I don’t want to remember the title everywhere anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by pouring in food and going to his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation to his therapist, finds himself running a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately the patients face their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another drives herself to death with intent)
This fear is called “the fight” in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That’s the rough plot I’m pretty sure the book in the original was written by a French author/author.
If this story is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book I would be very pleased.
Oh, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I have to contact my husband first.
But it can take time.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it possible to return the price difference?
Child, 4 j., splitter under the thumbnail

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker plus sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It masters the DCC data format as well as Motorola<0xC2><0xAE>, Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus<0xC2><0xAE>, the decoders log in fully automatically at a suitable digital center.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom<0xC2><0xAE>, the CV values can be read out on the main track with suitable centrals.
For centrals that can only program the CVs of 1-255 exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes it possible to reprogramm with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx<0xC2><0xAE>-compatible central units.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin<0xC2><0xAE> braking ranges as well as ZIMO<0xC2><0xAE> HLU braking commands or the Lenz<0xC2><0xAE> ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with direct voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops on a Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> brake diode.
An ABC automatic pendulum allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC paths.

Omicron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccination
New cases of Omikron are getting politics and science in the UK.
By New Year’s Eve, all eligible adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move ahead with corona booster vaccinations even faster than expected in the face of rapidly rising omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year if at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
So far, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Omikron variant is facing an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's get boosted now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I'm for everyone to introduce themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to kick an official.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine with pronouns.
I have five books in total.
4 of them.
Only the one I bought today can't
Obviously the chair had an undetected shortcoming in sales.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Just try on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working since about.
No more 14 days.
Therefore, I always bought the last books through the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and invoice me.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I’m going to write a little bit in detail about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
For professional reasons, I (21) more often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
One topic that really gnaws on me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims cannot be helped or think we could not help them.
I know that we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can’t do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing range, I cannot reach everyone.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it’s fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of taking the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, which is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the "League of Legends" series worth?

Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby-Debacle of the MHP Giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick was relying.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the cup defeat at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October: "We still have some anger in our belly".
After the game, however, it did not settle - but increased again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Bundesliga basketball.
Even more than the naked result disappointed the manner of appearance.
Deputy may be mentioned a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The trio quota was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) with say and write 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick responded: “We just weren’t focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and we didn’t implement what we trained.”
Namely to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "A horny match to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
“It felt like 10,000 people.”
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team's game.
“The best game maker I’ve ever trained,” Gleim praised.
While in Patrick’s team, the top performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all along the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points, having already fallen back 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there isn’t much time left for quarrels.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims have been rejected.
We have been legally informed again and have therefore written them again.
We first contacted him about half a year ago.
Max Raabe: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of Schlagers from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is on the road with the program "Good day, dear happiness" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't do anything.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to curb the corona virus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season also need to start, as it is called on the website of the singer, who now turns 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to make up for their dates already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and likes to sing as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palastorchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of Schlagers and Chansons in the style of Comedian Harmonists.
He has often been awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) - just like his hit album "For Women is Not a Problem" (2013) - reached second place on the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to think of from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good morning, dear happiness" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new home
The new Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has opposed the expropriation of large housing companies, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of lease law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, “we will talk with the coalition partners about further steps,” the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 people could be killed.
The pictures are reminiscent of a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States have wreaked serious devastation, possibly killing up to 100 people.
The storms leave a 320-kilometre-long trench of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado passed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just go away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official figures rising every hour.

Companies Pay Vaccine Awards and Change Advertising Claims
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums for the vaccination.
Thus, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising slogans to calls for vaccinations - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the readiness for corona vaccinations.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to Greetings!
I’m running the adventure Over the Gripping Pass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual files are designed and now I am about to write the entry adventure and stumble on my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a ship with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, the heroes are told to lure a group of goblins and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger at an early stage, whatever comes to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and swords
In case of non-remarks, the goblins lurk at the hero in a hollow path and flanking at three left and right bows armed the fugitive, while two with spears stop the fugitive.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are subject to it, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The carriage is gone, of course.
If a defeat is inevitable, the same half-eleven intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the hero in battle.
The cart is still there, all great.
What do you think about Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The group Goblins will play a decisive role later on, so it’s not just cannon food.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I’m sure to listen to many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I've broken up the lamp again.
And back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send them back anyway
If you can send the return vouchers, I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
First, the transfer was cancelled today in the middle of the F2 race to get F1 pre-reporting to start on time.
Although the delayed start and start-up accident meant that the schedule was far behind schedule, but we could still show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, for legal reasons F1 enjoys priority and therefore has to restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a little praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in the F1 there was again ignorance of the rules with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the decision that Verstappen was allowed to change the tyres when there were corresponding radio calls to Hamilton on this issue.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I think you should know such basic rules when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV station.
It is also not the first puzzle guess, which is now possible or prescribed under the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally speaking, Roos doesn’t like the articulated commentary style, but admit that it’s a matter of taste.
But I really like even Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant nonsense, which both simply make it look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (also unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of uneasiness in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out round, Sky is the only station that goes into the advertising, as you can listen at F1TV since only the German soundtrack has to do without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Also, these two stations make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free TV station.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the program of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that broadcasts F1.
Unisonously, RTL does a better job in the four races that they are still allowed to transfer, except for advertising.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Click here: #PRS_ORG# Pendant lamp, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it will be shipped on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already exhibited a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for providing an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
Here you can see the performance in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable for connecting multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump also offer to set an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (find with us in the shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something like that.
The MK-Series has a special, soundproofed construction for low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outflower or the like... and it can be started.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher than the water level and be mounted outside.
If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, you should place a check valve in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent water once running backwards from running out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time here in ebay with 3 days, it is packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
Everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has an understanding of all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry... of course, no Corona stops here.
Please do not rate it badly just because the delivery is delayed, which is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to scold about these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be mad at anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrest?
Can you also order your legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and host to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under bright blue skies, Bezos personally welcomed the freshly-cut astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
With the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they travelled for 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut son Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: Space engineer Dickne, Space Engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan.
Blue Origin did not say how much they paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father’s mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his missions and do everything himself.
She just flew along like that, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to go back to space again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 km altitude
The missile system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times with no gravity before the reusable object landed again braked by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as a boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin’s third manned all-terrain excursion: Amazon founder Bezos was on board for the first time in July, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject in itself quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before studying but also thought at the time that I certainly want to study until my doctorate and will.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially overwhelming career prospects.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) you always hear great job opportunities and the profession is totally wanted, on the other hand you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really be interested:
1) What are you working on right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your feedback!
I am currently really insecure and may be considering terminating my studies and taking a training as an IT specialist in 2022.
If you have any experience, I would also like to write it :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only now a post on it.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
As it seems, there are also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: last week there was Mary's Ascension, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses are holding a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
It was a long four-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
E-mails that had to go out before the driveway, order here order there, everything *indispensable* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very annoyed.
What is this self-hostage about holidays?
Why do we have holidays when we can’t afford them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simple: are only we, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will tune in to the feast by baking and making biscuits with her son.
“I love it,” Catterfeld said.
Until the contemplative days, however, she has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to start now."
NEKTON-Bio supports smooth mouse and plumage regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all necessary vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g biotin/kg.
NEKTON organic gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird farming is due exclusively to nutritional defects.
Since the feather consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are due to lack or imbalance of protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin supplement should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it

DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was also designed by the small trachees in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the reconstruction proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with game tracks and defective components see photos, function well, The series E 95 is a heavy motive of the German railroad
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have been operationally repaired
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered with the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
They all survived World War II and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The workability of all six locomotives was established at the Reichsbahn-Verbesserungswerk Dessau.
[4] With the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network, an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy goods train service was found, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reworked in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
In this case, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 which are present in larger quantities were first preferably constructed.
Only when the E 94 could be seen that the work-up number could not be increased further, the E 95 came into the focus of the work-up.
[4] First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to the railway plant Halle P in 1960.
They were usually used in their own circulation plan before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
For example, shooters often stuck in switching operations.
Then the constantly driving fellow on this locomotive with hammer and wooden wedge had to loosen the shooter again during the drive.
Damage to the driving engines occurred more often and resulted in months of outages at the locomotive.
[5] As there were enough new construction locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most splinter types, so that the E 95 was decommissioned.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives with only one man, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the above-mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's stand.
[5] After E 95 02 and E 95 03 were decommissioned in mid-1969, E 95 01 was the last decommissioned on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 has therefore never been used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switching heating system at Halle Central Station.
It took some time before the officials at the Reichsbahn were convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive was first reworked externally with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since belonged to the Transport Museum Dresden as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is supervised museumally.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational reworking of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint finish, whereby the transformers were checked and five driving engines were operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching side lanes, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Middle German network.
The main area of operation was Silesia.
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function well, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary in own work, dusted, with game traces, cellar odor !!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and traces of storage.
Yes, the F-parts are
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The center beam does not fit into the provided holder.
So I'm getting new ones sent.
When will they be sent out?
No, no flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones from the mold, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
With me they are not flat
Could I get them sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential house fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were easily injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has been incurred in the six-digit euro area, as police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume that the fire was deliberate.
Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it comes much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To Defuse Fake News - Biontech CEO Releases Vaccine Photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
Biontech chief U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend’s illness prompted him to do so, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainz company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine,” <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote on Friday in a post on the “LinkedIn” network.
"For a few months now, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far he has refused this because the communication should not be about himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
“However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.”
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle circulates on the Internet, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the priority has long been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times according to his own data.
Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage at a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg-Circle in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to do without electricity for about 24 hours.
The fire killed 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities on Friday night.
The supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
He thanked them for their patience and the helpers for their help.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless use," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology division, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, since the West grid assemblers were initially only able to restart some lines provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
The fire that erupted on Friday at around 7.15 p.m., according to Westnetz, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching system at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There is a need for extensive cleaning and repair work.
Parallel to this, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually connected from 9.30 p.m.
Since 11.15 p.m., the last ones affected by the failure had also had electricity.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies have been deployed.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday noon, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens in their neighborhood take care of elderly or single people and inform the local fire brigade houses if help is needed," said Land Councillor Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those who could not care for themselves or who require power-dependent medical devices or rely on medical care.
Good morning to you.
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy <0xE2><0x99><0xA1>
But I can't mount the base on the table top.
This is custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can’t push them into one another and thus shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I'd have to send it back, otherwise it's not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive feedback
yes this is really easier!
Then let's do it that way!
will you send me the return note by mail?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
However, before buying, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We disagree with this
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are sprinted on the podium at the World Cup in Estonia’s Otepää.

Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes we have both remade s and use version 4.5...
You may have heard of problems more than once.
I bought directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.

As far as I can tell it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?

I have to work in the meantime too!
For the application of paint to be even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water of dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse and dry with clear water.
Before applying the brush to the model with a new color for the first time, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush evenly next to the line.
Slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid swiping back and forth with the brush.
As a result, unrealistic surfaces are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones might shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metal shingles can occur if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you disassemble them.
Originally true appearance the models reach through the decals or decals.
From landmarks on aircraft to ship names to ornamental strips and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Attach the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily reached.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a calm hand when sticking.
Cut out each needed decal individually and put it right for you.
Decals are also called water sliding pictures because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper darkens through the wet.
Then you only slide the picture a small piece of paper and place the piece in the appropriate place on the model (which you also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper away from the side.
Attention: Always check to see if the image fits correctly before you completely push it off the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, crease or even tear.
Vacuum excess water with a household towel.
Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to log out and register and reload the book and find me the place where I have read.

Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages with me
Thank you very much!
I’ll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Will I get it back without any problems?
Paediatric wish treatment at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We were in childbirth treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly turns out to be transverse.
In turn:
We had applied for the paternal pathway settlement in advance with the PKV and received the promise over 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first trial led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and did 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet reckon with the PKV.
We applied again for the cost coverage of the PKV and were again granted 3 further trials.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more trials than promised, logically the most expensive ones reckon with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second request for children is a new insurance case.
According to AGB, however, "The insurance case begins with the healing treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or us (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have told us in the promises that with one birth the further attempts will expire?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to closed ovaries) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you send me the three variants by email and tell me how to reach them again
All right, all right.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customers.
You are welcome to pass this on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you tell me that I have to return the thing first.
I don't think I can do anything for the chest of drawers to arrive at me completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the repayment was initiated and I still have not received a repayment by #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We are not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, you can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the 24 month warranty applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we can not find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget movie is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What do you think of it?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, I have already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much!
With kind regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will give up again soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello!
"Halber victory" against Belarus with high cost to the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation Science and Politics (SWP) explained.
This floating state - Belarus does not give very little, but the EU feels that it is a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It does not seem to be able to prevail if a Member State sets itself to do its thing," as Poland currently does, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: A principled agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
A new attempt at crossing the border
According to Polish border guards, migrants have again attempted to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the agency said Sunday.
The Polish officials were thrown stones in the incident near the town of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to reports, a soldier was shot in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, 52 border guards attempted to cross the border within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as a ruler in Minsk of attracting them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to countries of origin to prevent people from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
“The EU has thrown its market power into the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.”
Minsk must also take into account domestic policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly lock thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Abu Dhabi Formula 1 final, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The silver arrows suggest two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged breach by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken irregularly.
A second objection was filed against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had come to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken the car driving in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and contact you again
Thank you for the support

Foxle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop.”
Since the beginning of the 1990s the cooperation between the Bundesliga and the amusement park in Rust, located 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has been in existence.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits.
To see radiant fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord" author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the night noises on her doorstep.
Yesterday I abandoned the contact form for returning an article, but did not receive email confirmation or the like.
My question is whether my request has been received.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite, that doesn't mean anything.
It’s like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both of them will not admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you just have to leave it completely.
Wow, you're not as serious as Colleague.
Whoever seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
Because of me, one God set it all in motion.
But once you’re a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
And so you're an enemy of science and don't take it any more seriously as Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass virtually without registration and color errors up to the edge zone.
Often, magnifying glasses are marked with magnification.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, we ask you to observe the instructions in the table "Technical data" (See instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - that is, even in the case of impact magnifiers - light reflections are produced.
Due to an antireflex coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
If the optimum conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (available in German and English).

#PRS_ORG# I will do very nice and good service, although it took you to get to a person, you were great
Hello dear #PRS_ORG# team,
I have already contacted you under the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was said before.
You cannot deliver from England because of #PRS_ORG#.
Pine sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced so many curious situations in the fir sale.
Once a man is said to have driven home even without his partner, because the two could not agree.
Every year, he plants a good 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a curious situation.
It always makes Christmas fun, he says.
And that with the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating spear.
Both have their name.
In German, perhaps an equivalent would be something like the "Dreher", which by far does not sound so delicious.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have trouble building a stable Wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit port and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbits perfectly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which emits the Wifi, no longer arrives with the full 500, but the further I distance myself in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic port is now even slower on the first floor than before (<0x5C><0x7E>45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the DLan, there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could anyone explain to me why fiber optics "lost" so much internet speed over the power line?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely complicated to install LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased with an answer.
When it’s time to change the checking account
Anyone who would have thought that it would be quiet at the checking accounts, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to get their customers to confirm the past fee increases with all sorts of tricks, the free amounts for negative interest rates are also falling further.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the free amount and even quartered for the day money.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for checking and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily money accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already fallen to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centrals, who in the first instance have even gotten right against this regulation in the district court of Berlin.
The banks are already discussing whether the institutions should make provisions - in the event that the top authorities also declare negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions to bank customers have to be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and a descent.
Jennifer Aniston has been voted the most influential woman of the year by The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made furore in 2021 with the "Friends" reunification and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a UNIQUE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of female and male fans fly to her, however, is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with luck - and still looking for great love.
And deleted the baby wish from the list.
Earlier, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what’s going on with me personally, medically, why I can’t.
It was really hurtful.
Hopefully, success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of career: Raikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen’s farewell to Formula One was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight band contact, Räikkönen had to shut down his Alfa Romeo after not even half the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport royal class.
To say goodbye, his wife Minttu and the two children also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen’s biggest success was the 2007 Ferrari World Championship.
He won 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times.
Friedrich wins the 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the two-man squad - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
“I’ve figured that out, I’d have to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it through Cortina 2026,” said the double Olympic winner from BSC Oberbärenburg, who had two wins in two days at the Winterberg races.
First on Saturday, he repelled Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed some of the material setting and drove out a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed in front of the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came to second place earlier this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer of BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place in the first race for fourth place.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way,” Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
For the women, Laura Nolte won the third season in the Zweierbob on her home track.
After the day before in the Monobob was only enough for fourth place, she rushed to the World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple win with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-year-old Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualifying, she took the first podium this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki ended up in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me along.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It is not only pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little angry about the not entirely flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I can't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Through Corona I had quite different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now he said he had expired which made me very upset.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I'd like to return it and order again, since it's just reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16 March?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap it comes an extra field with the message
It was taken away by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don’t cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello love great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I want to write, and maybe one of them - or others - is like that.
I am 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - sometimes besides that my dog does not scream or go to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (since 6J together) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I still have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because the hand is in the dressing wg burn).
He’s cool on top of that and we’re seeing less (1-2x week) at the moment, which makes me very busy with my needs for affection and love.
My dog has just been in pain, I cooked for him and now he is in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and caress for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have housework to do, which we of course split up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is right now quite well set, I am half well-treated and can cope.
Not good, but I get along and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have a written test for which I haven’t done anything yet and tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the next day, then it's weekend.
But after that, does it all go on?
Just until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'm packing this ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I’m infinitely grateful that I don’t have to work.
Infinitely grateful, I can’t put that into words.
I don’t know if I would have survived my KPTBs.
I think it also has a lot to do with mental load of women and that's why I thought I'm sure I'll find sufferers here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we are going to change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The email for the cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The other two times.
But it was not confirmed.
I found out at school that many religious teachers don’t believe in God and that it’s just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, it was always a little strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed in some way.
What do you think?
You may also be able to tell about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum etc.
But it would just be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn’t believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
True culture or something?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Write it in English I also understand it well
It's been a long time, then I'd shy away from it
All right, thank you.
I am expecting a feedback promptly, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search for help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
The modern world (real world).
The past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can't describe it anyway in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths intersect and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself I mean.
The transition is also, I believe, the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers fight against each other.
If that’s what I’m saying, I’m grateful for every answer.
Our little girl slept only on her stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than you think.
Make sure that everything around is correct, do not cuddly animals, often go in and watch, but do not watch for minutes.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he is asleep.
Is it turning your head aside?
Can it get up from the stomach?
Or is it moving forward with the face directly in the mattress?
This is how you can determine if everything is okay.
We all grew up too and when my husband was born, it was like a gang and there was a way for you to put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "stamkunde" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why do you offer me only 20 euros?
Hello, I already wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It is about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently in use.
To put it very clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply that the politics of this station is now under the control of all.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It has been said that you are an "independent" Internet transmitter.
Arno: “You don’t want to be a running pillar.”
What is it now?
An 0815 advertising channel that tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, this applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogman who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rooms rented tries to make ashes.
How to find all this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I ask for a call back, as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus fracture due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter with abdominal pain or just for cuddling – my little warmth friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry nut pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, since cherry nuts can absorb heat very well and dispense with doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not so well.
The cherry core cushion with cover is exclusively suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual odor, stick or fire spots and dispose of immediately if present.
Please take the inner cushion for heating out of the cover beforehand!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (note information from the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, evenly distribute the heat in the pillow by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion back in the cover.
During the first warming, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of inflammatory and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the cushion's temperature for suitability for babies (max 43 °C) on your armbow!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, bruising and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases, as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores leak, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to prevent overheating!
Any serious incidents in connection with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
In the meantime, Hannover 96 is working from the table cellar.
Ingolstadt won't play under the third coach either.
Jubilee in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed departure under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough for operation.
Incorrect display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the plugged in power supply.
After that I removed the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the mains?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don’t know how high the seat is.
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 liters capacity can also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored with the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need in everyday objects, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and can be separated from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is also presented in a new look.
With the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: once conventionally via the cover flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor beams on the front side of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling levels": there are 4 anchor beams, stable riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without locking the hook.
The second option also fundamentally differentiates the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to roam through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: because if you take with you not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and so easily store both separately - and also access it independently through the two lateral openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# yesterday sent me an email confirming the commissioning of the
Announced contact by the forwarding company to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far I have not received a message.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support staff, with none I came further than the promise that I will receive an email as a confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#
Is it possible to see when the cabinet can be delivered again?
Keeping it that way is not an option for me.
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Wishing you a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you renew the voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but after all I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that last year went differently than I thought I couldn’t guess and I just couldn’t solve it in time and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is based on the characteristics of the original assembly with the balancing of the disk.
The tuning discs manufactured in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
In addition, openings created increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, with the incisions improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic features of our tuned discs underline the character of every car with their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining pieces in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were set up, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You’ll look for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your fellow pioneers so as not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions at the same time, you have to balance your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional promotions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), from 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California officially gained statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lockdown!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players alternately perform actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolver heroes.
When all the actions are complete, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the prize winner turns to a new location and changes the available promotions.
This continues until the prize-winner has moved five times, i.e. every location has once covered up and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players have to defend Coloma from an angry bandit raid.
If players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final ranking takes place.
The player with the most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW Psychic Violence, Sexual Abuse, Power Abuse
The ARD documentation appeared on my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and guardians now make serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourself, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries consult on the elimination of the test obligation for triple vaccinated
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the test obligation for triple vaccinated people.
"We need clarity quickly as to whether and when the test requirement can be waived for three times vaccinated," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, told the "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinators "is not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccine stimulus," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal on this as early as next Tuesday at the Conference of Ministers of Health".
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to do this?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases via my #PRS_ORG#.
Oops, an error has occurred.
Purchase via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer goes.
I have updated my account details.
What is the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, meaning perceptions of the senses under general anesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/voices, less often to see images and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant for this topic: C-sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until abnatalization.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia preliminary interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are accompanied by a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had ** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
I read your comment incorrectly.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the $20 doesn’t help either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of e-commerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I've already sent you an email that you haven't replied to.
The question again.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they were only delivering to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that right?
If so, I have to cancel the order as I do not know a person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at age 97
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as a director.
Later he wrote a monumental theater story.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell to the world led by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I have already witnessed my thanks to life here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are europallets, standardised wooden pallets, which are mainly used as cargo carriers in Europe.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020, according to statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was about 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not charged
New York wins the MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title for the first time in Major League Soccer.
After 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team decided to finish in the penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York won against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect gulasch.
This was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I have come to taste and want to cook roulade for the first time on New Year’s Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a cattle fund for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I can get that.
IIt is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money has not been received.
Would you please check that.
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is one of the Christmas days such as the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought a poultry yet?
Now the time is running out.
We will tell you where you can get a Christmas cake in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tubular end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level on the one hand, and on the other hand, the distortion content of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control that can reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "gain" and distortion.
It already sounded like with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even float a power reserve if it happens outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using a headset or in direct recordings, you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate tuner.
Anyone who additionally uses a VFS5 foot button can also conveniently call up the sounds by foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and tap the pace of the compatible effects.
This is indispensable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX takes another step into the future!
I had seen it that way with others.
Will you be able to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with this?
What about the chest of drawers?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If not, I would also be happy with a discount or voucher.
I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don’t need is a lot.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
The negotiations on a revival of the international nuclear agreement are progressing, according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This was a "positive and important development", because at first there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement were continued after a short week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only state, Thuringia was above the 1000 mark in the corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which last had always had the highest incidence nationwide, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the Sars CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people suffering from COVID-19 were treated in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health offices have been overburdened for weeks and hardly come after with the detection of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is only in early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and send it to the post office, right?
here I do not have to click / enter / fill in?
That’s what I want to avoid, so I’m writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my opinion a freak.
It's time for change
###Bundestag greet me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past few months of the MBMonthday, you can see one thing: it is not ecstatic.
We have come into a winter starvation and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
#What is the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction, how some things have happened here and how we are in general.
In the last few days, the impression has increased that many people here have a real Bock on MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked about MBBundestag, who wants to keep it alive.
The impulse came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found a, simply put, heap of shreds.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, on which we can exchange with each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBMonday work in the future?
* What existing orders need to be changed/adjusted/removed?
* How should we act externally in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a few things, but that’s not bad, we ended up with the discord.
If you have the desire and the time, come to the discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/cloudy for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, since the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, are there also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the defective cabinet is picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as much as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a guide for assembly?
How long will I have time to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague who I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, she probably rarely eats meat at the moment.
I was also a vegetarian for a few years.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
For a long time I thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I would ultimately support animal torture.
That is why I decided to become vegan.
At the moment I had the impression that there was displeasure on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and meant she knew where her meat came from and how to reduce animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer to “plump” was?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without it being put on it.
It greets a harmonious loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception according to <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the statutory requirements for distance selling.
I am on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my return on site.
Since I can’t be on site because of a funeral, unfortunately this cannot be changed either.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be back all the time.
Lahnsteiner Wehr ready for water rescue: EUR 45,000 grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, in the Lahnstein City Hall, presented a grant decision of 45,000 euros for the new equipment car Water Rescue of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there are permanently rising stakes: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and the Moselle and the continued increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following their recommendations, I have synchronized, removed and the app reloaded NOTHING worked.
I'm a little frozen because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and now I'm hoping for help.
Okay, that's what it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for standing up for the whole thing here, I also spent nearly a decade in state service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also weapon carriers in the executive, I wouldn’t want to go further!
The question of right and left is always very simple.
Basically, however, it should be said that of course the state servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, this should actually be clear to everyone.
That of course also in the special uniform and weapon wearers people right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone, that then of course these people can hardly deal with the lived reality is of course also clear, because of course you have, in addition to the average white, now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and with that I mean now not the exaggerated feminine clichés, but they do not have to save you in a doubt on an exa
But these marginal groups also represent, even if it first sounds strange to my experience as a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly advocates for them or wants to make them right, while they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross section of society, you will also find extreme right there, but that they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that threaten the state is completely exaggerated and annoys me as well.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who were often in foreign operations often start to flat-rate due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that there are certainly occasions when right-minded colleagues meet who carry out a lively exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is being fought well and also countered by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so entangled internationally and that is also so good in my opinion that we couldn’t afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, which I do not understand, I have ordered the other basket on the German side as well.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it was not sold out.
I ordered it in November.
it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but at the top of the wooden part are two deep notches filled with something yellow
And in the mirror itself is a small scratch
Better by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy with one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little free time), but already throughout my life I get it more bad than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never really that “someone could come to visit spontaneously”.
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it does bother me somewhere but most of the time household loses simply against work and unpleasantness.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now, on my question, have you managed to get a better child?
We have not yet worked on it and this question has been an issue for me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so doll, as long as no visitor comes and e.g. there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I'm looking forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I did a training in software development and have now been trained for about a year.
Unfortunately, however, I realize more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time to start again and study social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxious avoidance) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means, roughly speaking, I have no self-esteem and accordingly am shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have loose conversations and I have been told more often that I do not seem to be close (which I think has already gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth meeting but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family assistance.
But I don’t know if the specific day-to-day work is really the way I imagine it, and it’s difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("though the simplest things are again screwed up") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should now really know myself how to do this" / "I have to keep him off my work" / "the emmer" with my stupid questions.
I will probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to mention it at the time.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pick-up
What do you mean by returning?
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message comes your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed, the bird breaks down into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and builds up from them its own proteins, which it also needs for the formation of plumage.
The formation of feathers in the nesting and the formation of new feathers in the mouse-growing bird are extremely complex processes and associated with a particularly high stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding cycle.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio should be switched back to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin supplement) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 g of NEKTON organic on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is advisable to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One coated measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON bio.
In the case of severe plumage damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of the plumage reformation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is reached until the plumage re-formation is complete.
Storage: NEKTON bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break down after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a community employee in reply to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
Submitted an application to the municipality.
One employee writes to me that the falling of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I think that, only the question is yes, can I pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?

Ah, okay, I understand.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Happy Christmas to you for the first time!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is devising everything you can devise.
Before I break out here now .. in short: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a lateral entry.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in a field (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don’t call anything more precise here).
It was all too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up at the Magisterium and I was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job advertisements".
And it's only been half a year.
In the paintings before that I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still swivel.
But right now I'm completely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Now it's holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress resistant, but there my weekend was also my weekend and my end was my end.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter in the moments.
Now, family celebrations are too stressful for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that irritate me additionally.
Basically it is fun and from the outside the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I’m completely depleted and wondering how much stress my body can endure before it shuts down completely – if it doesn’t already do that.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially if I read some of your posts here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but it was adequately paid for it, and together in a team what I have worked out and not as a single fighter now.
But then I wonder if I didn’t get back to the same place in a year as I am now and I’m dissatisfied.
You know, it’s all kind of messy, but maybe you as outsiders have some advice or ideas about how I get out of this situation, which I’m completely done and almost at the smallest thought I start crying.
I’m not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably doesn’t lead to anything good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thanks for reading and apologize for the weeping undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX’s Valvetronix series has evolved steadily, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps, of course, also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply achieve the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed casing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only bubble.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a boost in performance of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the dual-speaker VT120+, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tubular amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of game dynamics and string strike, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that, above all, the output stage determines the tubular character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
Equipped with a 12AX7 tube, the Valve Reactor circuit of any VT+ amplifier perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
Orlando Magic's NBA Defeat Series continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counters from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro parts, it is entirely tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends of course on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a plug-in flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for things that aren’t photo.
Also drone pilots make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, lava flows have caused major damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
The Tehuya volcano erupted in 1585, at 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists did not dare to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable,” said Mariano Hernández Zapata, president of the island council.
Damage in millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
This corresponds to nearly 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new lands were created by cold lava, with a total size of about 50 hectares.
Banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was severely affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is on the doorstep and especially the children will be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
This makes it all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peacemaking "social treaty of natural peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked with the gift.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. Nicholas’ Day.
The background to this popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women in their windows in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving came the popular custom in Germany to fill the boots especially of the children with gifts.
Protestants stumbled upon this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as “holy worship.”
For these reasons, they guard against the institution.
Martin Luther turned the Nicholas into the Christ child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it upsets only the few that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the Martinus custom with Martinssingen and Martinus's retreat.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots on the doorstep and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources attest to a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful muddle about the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region, whether the Christmas child appears on Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh drawn by reindeer, and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fabled creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought some glory to Father Frost.
Here are not reindeer, but three horses that draw his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for giving the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday.
Police said the caller reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped shortly after by officials.
There were shots and the man was shot.
He was still declared dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
There are several embassies in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that burn in color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – either in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic roundings fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also makes himself well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself on big preparatory work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require supply lines or batteries.
Place the "lightstone" at any spot shining from the sun during the day.
Two supplied ground spiders provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dawn, "Smart Stone" begins to glow automatically; in what color you determine yourself: In addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
Finally, the switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins the next day.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and fucking PMS before the period.
Now I would like to let this stay again, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic diseases that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
In my last two-year break from 0 to 100, I had burst pimples and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really burdened me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid it this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without poison, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynaecologist did not take me so seriously and a skin doctor appointment is still coming.
Thank you to everyone who has read the novel!
Dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertary bad atopic dermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-area nodules and the acne issue.
I have also tried everything possible in the course of chronic disease and have stuck on sugar, milk and low-meat mixed food, because nothing else has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormonally is simply the worm in it, but if you have construction sites everywhere you want to stop looking no more what else is wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina o.a.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I have to work all the time and answer the phone and all of a sudden everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong

110 kV earth cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The plan determination decision of the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for the construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Parish Churches.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: Schedule lessons (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I currently still have big problems planning my lessons in the field of geography efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for the earth user).
I just need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and with me actually stands every hour for itself.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I actually always start from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build that (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Hence the worksheets as well.
Maybe I can get a geography teacher how to work time efficiently with the book.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would very much like to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears about Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
The trade believes this to be unnecessary and complains of sales declines.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German trade association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
For shops with items of non-daily need, sales declines are to be complained, criticized HDE Chief Executive Officer Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 traders, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive climax of the year is now often a hole without ground," Genth said.
Distributors with 2G access restrictions lost almost one-third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
It only runs well in food retail as well as in the online area.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the Chief Executive Officer.
"2G does not take us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations discouraged customers and required high staffing.
The regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the received volume on that day.
In addition, sampling checks should be sufficient in retail, as in public transport already in the case of the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Without 2G, frequencies last stood at about 75 percent of the pre-corona level, with sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now surely fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, at a central point in the center, can once provide their 2G proof and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed".
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also a mistake that has been tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks nasty.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed and glued it back into the package.
How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
To adjust the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very light flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiance angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the movie set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a bright display.
The display displays the current brightness adjustment in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply pressing one of the storage buttons for a longer period of time is occupied and finished.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that when the lamp is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work, e.g. when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can resort to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester equal with built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlight continuously with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for mounting, so you can use it directly to your photo stand.
The inclination must be reliably adjusted by means of fixtures on both sides.
It has been ensured that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilting joint is included.
Great is that included in the delivery is also a bag.
This allows you to safely transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories you may still want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a torn comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two unsuccessful Hesses were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga.
But then the SGE turned on, in a good hour the frustration over a full-blown start to the season sparked from the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It's madness what the guys did today," coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN and said a "package praise, to everyone who was there".
At the beginning, it looked like a new damper for the now ranked nine-ranked Frankfurters still below their expectations.
Patrik Schick led the Leverkuseners 2-0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defensive player Christopher Lenz, who for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overwhelmed muscle injury was able to stand again in the field, also stressed the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but is also well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It’s exceptional that we all got fit in December, that all players are physically in a top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now we want to "go on step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks "at this level until the turn of the year".
Next on Wednesday, in the course of the English week, a away game with Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30 p.m., Sky) will be on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent back to me directly or do I have to wait until the money is returned and place the order again?
Would for me then unfortunately mean that I will not order again because it has taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Handball women's cushion before quarter-finals against Spain
Germany’s handball women crept from the parquet after the humiliation against Denmark with hung heads and empty glances.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB team scored a near defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now run against host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were far too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," said German coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we have to act differently.
After the first loss in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a pity that we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game for all of us that we have to delete,” said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to enter the semi-finals against the 2019 World Cup seconds on Tuesday, a significant increase must be made to keep the tender dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was the back room player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," admitted backroom player Xenia Smits, demanding: "We have to look forward now quickly."
From front to back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on top with the whistle.
Fouls and technical flaws in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was achieved by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-shoot.
However, this was not the initial ignition hoped for.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly stage themselves - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game had run early in the 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since back room player Mia Zschocke shortly afterwards saw red due to a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she will be able to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and until the break at least five goals.
The already quiet hope of a catch-up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groeners sinned in all areas, making it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer stand up to an increase in performance and went off the parquet as a clear loser.

The title pretends that I am working as a vaccine doctor in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be finished for a large part, then part of it goes on in vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are personally related (e.g. "I take medicine X, this is compatible with vaccination.").
My task is to educate about the vaccination, the position of indication (the person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccine Regulation and no reasons to oppose it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In vaccine teams, however, we often have none, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, but who can not carry out vaccinations (must?), so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
"Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What, please, is a "huedler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, there has been intense reflection in the BR television program "Wir in Bavaria".
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time remained unspoken by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one who "has to go fast".
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg communicated the solution to and thus probably caused astonishment for many of the Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer," the spectators learned, "is a cloth with which someone wipes out the furnace."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian Television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this was a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known word "Houdern".
Which closed an educational gap - probably also with some who have lived for a long time in the Amberg area.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice on road bike - really so breakdown-proof?
This morning I woke up full of urge to do something because I wanted to work out at least a bit to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I drove off with my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then happened what lurks in every downtown (this time: thank you Krefeld!)
Glass splinter on the track.
Zack, hissing loudly and my rear tyre didn’t want to go the rest of the track anymore.
Due to the weekday, I had no real opportunity to get a spare coat and a spare hose, so I had to turn around and take the first train home with half a bad mood.
Then it wasn’t all that bad in terms of mood, maybe it’s even better if I practice this with the tire change again before the bike tour.
Now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance ahead of me for several days, I would be extremely unwilling to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since also the old tyres of the previous owner (very nice old man, the day I came to pick up the bike to 14h 120km!) and who had already called these as suboptimal, because he drove with them for several years on roll.
But if I think that I have to make a tire change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who wondered why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; they should be unplated.
Now, of course, it all sounds very tempting.
But are they really so unbreakable?
I don't want to spend 40€/tires now, just to be disappointed.
At the moment, I think I have 25x622 on the road bike.
Although there are also (apparently?) Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on a road bike in general to other tyres?
The Schwalbe page seems to me to be absolute! LaieKnowledge rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and greetings!
Car Throws at Tree: Driver Deadly Injured
The 53-year-old had collided on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained cause against a central island and then came onto the counterroad, as the police informed.
There, there was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old’s car was then thrown at a tree and the man was jammed in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would again get offspring.
SOLO 15 is called the new sprout and visually recalls the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitable designed foot directly to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but to sound an exceptionally high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned to tonal with a slight high pitch.
This is generally common for wide bands in order to optimize the bundling which is greatly increasing too high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the hearing area, the SOLO 15 impresses with a very clear and fine sound.
Easily rotated outwards, the high tone range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure an enemy dynamics that its same looks for.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning to plan corresponding changes in the construction.
If you want to veneer the housings, for example, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer again applies material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to carry out the cable there without problems later.
With the help of an upper milling cutter, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be inserted flush.
On the rear side, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel in order to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the bead, as shown in the picture "Detail Bead".
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
These are now glued to the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor.
The three stiffenings should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in material thickness if required, for example if you want to use finished strips from the construction market instead of producing them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
After that, all the panels of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front, follow.
The installation of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall, is facilitated by means of a suitable perforated circular saw or a forest drill.
A round cutter is then used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded off.
Subsequently, the foot plate is glued firmly to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
The following is the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blow out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
The entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, the cable is led to the speaker opening and let it hang out there also loosely.
Subsequently, the frequency switch is prepared and used.
The design plan of the switchgear, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document:
If the switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is followed, which is not yet completely closed.
Thanks to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and close it.
Due to the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, it is possible to check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the attenuation according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) has to be soldered at the plus pole of the loudspeaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept open.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> Finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> For known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per shift, so we will be following the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we’ll do everything we can to keep the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Get cold drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
