Rapidly progressive cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare more for an outbreak of COVID-19 patients who will need care and, above all, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a portion of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom and compared them with those in the Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of that country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, cases of COVID-19 had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between December 31, 2019 and the date mentioned above, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, is updated every day at 8 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day shortened incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, during the period from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of reported cases from each country until March 15, 2020 at 8 a.m., and compare with Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom in general followed those in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
Overall, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar trends of increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of March 15 at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are in different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and, possibly, different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that should be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including testing for updating.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on COVID-19 hospitalization and/or ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data with a focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and semi-intensive treatment beds for a population of 100,000 between 2010 and 2011).
Modeled scenarios related to health system capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a 90% higher risk of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases so far have been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example from Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who will need medical care, mainly intensive treatment, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid increase in the number of cases anticipated may not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, accept and adapt their actions properly, if not implemented with antecedent.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to step up their control initiatives to lessen the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and lessen the pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus disease 2, has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous SARS-CoV virus, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than younger people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the rapidly developing research object.
We will deal with the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
While many questions still need answers, we hope this study will help in understanding and eradicating this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to stay confined for the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease was called CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients killed.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one public enemy,” and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequencing of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by VOC, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we find twice highly pathogenic human VOCs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, current COVID-19 is the third VOC epidemic in the documented history of humans.
As shown in Fig.1,1, a portion of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were initially reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019, to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the VC sequencing was published.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the contagion of health professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the place of onset of contagion by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
To date, the disease has spread to China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation is rapidly deteriorating, the scale and final severity of the epidemic must still be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a study of several centers with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the age group of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, some were under the age of 20, and only 14 infected were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in groups, mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The baseline reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people infected grew exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the massive transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain sense.
They can be divided into four genera, namely: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are known to infect humans.
The glycoprotein spike (S) of the envelope binds to its cellular receptors of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and, in sequence, membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms vesicles that contain virions, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, the particles of SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in ultrafine sections of the epithelium of the human airways.
Human ECA2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein S binds to human ECA2 protein weaker than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ECA2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for recognition and infection by CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like bat CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross species barriers and infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes carry the virus from bats to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that pangolins, elongated-nose mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the 99% genetic homology between a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% in two genomes is a big difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence are awaited (Fig. 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are for the most part still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days below 20°C with humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and 56 °C heat for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can consult only previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host by means of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including lectin type C receptors, Toll type receptor (TLR), NOD type receptor (NLR) and RIG-I type receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV protein N may help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
Collaborating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including complements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects more elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a higher chance of being infected than other people.
The average estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and, for the most part, 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases demonstrated that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, demonstrates that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people from transmitting the virus to other people without symptoms.
As usual, individuals exposed to or infected with the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rash, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in lung imaging, should undergo screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilatory support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which consists of the higher mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was needed for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Comparatively, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the baseline reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.71 to 7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 ranged from 2 to 4, only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with respect to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a grouping of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of traveling or residing in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients within two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms, and healed patients who have been discharged from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm to extend the quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte counts below 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was elevated, and the number of lymphocytes was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities in the chest X-ray are present in most patients with COVID-19, and present with bilateral irregular shadows or matt glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the exchange of gases.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most severe chest X-ray results usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumotic peeling, hyalin membrane formation, infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncytial cells into the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of the polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which came to be not only derived from RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of use of the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 x 10-18 mol/L at 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter input) using a complex measuring rod in less than one hour.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new VOC, doctors can provide, at the best of their ability, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients, while attempting a variety of therapies that have been used or previously proposed for the treatment of other VOCs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ACE2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high-flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an alternative modified cardiopulmonary technique used to treat severe heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine cascade results from the exacerbated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the cells of the immune system to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, are being used to treat the cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include modulation of immune response directed to T cells; blockage of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; JAK inhibition, blinatumomab; cytokine signaling suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
They can cause serious side effects, mainly avascular osteonecrosis, drastically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of treatment with low to moderate dose corticosteroids have been recommended for caution in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-tape RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has provided the compound to China to perform some tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are long awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma of healed patients and generation of antibodies
Blood collection from patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contraction of the disease has a long history.
In fact, healed patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who healed from COVID-19, and was injected into 10 severely ill patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be cautiously considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is great for treating patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat an epidemic of world proportion.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or do a screening for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, TCM, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most of the effective components remain unknown, or are vague, as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimum combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it has been found that capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen are effective in treating COVID-19.
The best cure rates of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were considerably shorter in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than only in the group treated by Western medicine.
The rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower in the Western medicine and TCM group than in the Western medicine alone group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the Western medicine and TCM group than in the Western medicine alone group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await more properly controlled tests on larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel great fear of the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, symptoms of psychosis, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of public health system actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and the stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to people suspected of the disease and to people who have had contact with them, as well as to the general population in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission of animal reservoirs and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives have been taken to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before the start of a clinical trial.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and MERS outbreaks continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months, on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and variations in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognostic model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between the ages of 30 and 65, with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive care (mean age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive treatment are more likely to suffer acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have a strong correlation and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential prognostic factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also aid in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are present expressly in various organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or liver dysfunctions.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues for the prediction of COVID-19 outcomes/complications.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants typically used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from vascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low dosage and for a short period of time in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and witness the deaths of loved ones and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from the characteristics of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 is able to replicate effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the early stage of infection (or only causes mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or in the incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty for the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Great efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continued quarantine of nearly the entire population, hoping to halt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic will end by March, and the slowdown phase lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and mid corneum smears of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic flu-like episode.
However, promising indications have occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with rigid quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally kept under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, may become weaker in its infectivity and at some point become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS can be found below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing and sneezing and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which generates a new possibility: that of oral-fecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, co-workers and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected individual from being carried in the air or sticking to the surfaces of objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only N95 masks (series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation of virions with sizes from 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series No. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, health professionals should wear insulating robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent face protectors or protective glasses when caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay at home in isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
One meter is considered a suitable distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a major warning for China, based on its recent history with the 2003 SARS epidemic.
However, only on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus has a low rate of contagion and limited reproductivity among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left people more relaxed, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the containment of the disease in Wuhan on a minimal scale was missed.
China’s disease control agencies can take advantage of this harsh lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, such agencies should: (1) be more cautious in making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information coming from hospitals, rather than waiting for formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic from the public’s early stage and to improve the public’s awareness; (4) be more conscientious and more conscientious.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a sense of SARS return.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects the elderly more than the young, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in the elderly than in the young.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which causes a greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in parts, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, healed patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic counterpart was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from the bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to effectively cut the transmission, and the epidemic may recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a worldwide pandemic, disappear like SARS, or have seasonal recurrence like the flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and so many others.
However, regardless of the efforts required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the coevolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild disease, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) changed what was thought about CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating a HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put the SVCs in the spotlight again and surprised everyone with their high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of enormous utility.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigation of VoC host interactions in animals can also provide important information about VoC pathogenesis in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information on the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we make comparison and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current epidemic of CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of encapsulated viruses, positive polarity and single-tape RNA.
These viruses that have the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their corona morphology when observed under an electron microscope.
As for structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two overlapping open-reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
The polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genus contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, VOCs have constantly crossed species barriers, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively higher number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the flu of patients with a common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of today and infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding, and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic poses enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework to understand the natural history, the driving force, and the restrictive factors of the virus’ migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that parental viruses of HCoVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the trend of evolution of HCoV, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal VOCs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the coryza of patients who contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, mice, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in lung cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of the cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
Overall, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study in human volunteers, healthy subjects infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented HCoV pandemic in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superspreaders", it was estimated that each contaminated person can contaminate approximately two more, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by later symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients need, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of the zero patient travelling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old infant in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found that the virus was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old infant suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered all over the world.
It was estimated that HCoV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
All four community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to remain continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar to MERS, among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
Half by the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which was retrospectively known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and has also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4 percent.
It should be noted that the lethality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside that city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, in the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with the presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high 82% homology in the nucleotide sequence, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they may contribute to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveals similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and duration of the progression of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four community-acquired HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presence of non-specific, mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in community-acquired HCoVs and in SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing on to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies whether oral-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out if SARS-CoV-2 can exhibit seasonality, as in the case of community-acquired HCoVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after its passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious illness in humans and people who develop serious illnesses of HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize the restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If the adaptation is adequate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Several years ago, the four community-acquired CoVs circulated in human populations, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to humans, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seize the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as community-acquired HCoVs, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will fully adapt to humans and circulate between us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it houses a direct-relationship ancestor, sharing high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Likewise, a reservoir host houses the HCoV continuously and lastingly.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adapt adequately to the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmit it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
An HCoV may have the infection stopped if it is unable to sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the SARS patient zero had a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a guaxin dog in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the slaughter of all civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild masked palm civets or farm civets without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could only be the intermediate amplifier host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals may serve as intermediate SARS-CoV amplifier hosts cannot be excluded.
All of these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a close-relationship bat CoV, named Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoVs, with the exception of the so-called WIV1, can be isolated as live viruses.
The angiotensin-2 converting enzyme (ACE2) in humans is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from faecal samples of bats has been shown to use ECA2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor for entry into cells.
It is intriguing that the serum of SARS convalescent patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groups the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of bats and the CoV-HKU5 of bats.
The CoV-HKU4 of bats and the MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences are phylogenetically closer to the homologues in betaCoVs of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 of the bats, share only 87% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are HIV-positive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, in the same way as Middle Eastern camels in several African countries.
Living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal dromedary smears, increasing the evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that generally mild symptoms, but with mass transmission of the virus, were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is remarkable that infected camels transmit viruses not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses in bats.
However, responses are still lacking, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which can be plausibly attributed to transmission between people or to transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that house MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a rat ratg13 CoV, isolated from rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RatGT13 is too great to attribute a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless nearly identical CoVs of bats are discovered in the future.
It is presumed that intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be configured between wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Sea Fruit Wholesale Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of transmission from animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbor ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to RaTG13, with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into SARS-CoV-2-like virus underlines in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity in the amino acid sequence.
In a huge contrast, the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are more divergent, although they exhibit a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study of patient pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences from lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual curation to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs from pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs of pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolim, betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 share the highest broad genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of the pangolin-related betaCoVs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 derives from the selectivity-mediated converged evolution.
A contrary argument counts in favor of the recombination between the betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and the RatG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is very present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat CoVs, while parental HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses were discovered in rodents.
A CoV of bats named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the U.S. tricolor bat was reported to have a direct relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat Vo, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and camels are also suspected to be its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the current knowledge on the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlfaCoVs from bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been discovered.
Among them, there is an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the bat virus to humans.
First, humans, but not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, alphaCoVs from HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphaCoV caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphaCoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain from humans the alphaCoV related to HCoV-229E.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as the genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by later results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, colonies with high density, narrow social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV in dromedaries dates back decades.
He is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a stable natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a mild disease and sustains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and humans remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, since their transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Specifically, betaCoVs from pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be a terminal host for SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs, similar to civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts, in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is needed.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating VOCs to cross species barriers.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-ribbon RNA viruses, estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered from "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with a review mechanism, the exclusion of which results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir suppresses CoV replication by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the rate of mutation is usually high when the VOCs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host who maintains contact with humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and encoded protein functions relative to the last three inches of the end of the genome.
Third, CoVs exchange models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique "copy choice" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing container, the ribbon exchange occurs frequently during transcription of the VoC RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs, such as SL-CoV of bats and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between SARS-CoVs isolates from humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the DLR of S protein.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in amino acids 318 to 510 in fragment S1, which binds to human ECA2 as well as its co-receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is capable of recognizing the ECA2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, mice and guaxin dogs, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral and civet isolates in DLR, and four of them are located in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S unit implies that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electron cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times greater than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be useful to determine if any other coreceptors may be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of protein S.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They could also respond for the effective adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence on the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp the dependency factors with the host and subvert the host restriction factors for effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in this important area of the virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-biased screening at the genome level of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero stake
The diversity of CoVs of bats provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, the CoVs of bats serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated, but it has been found that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A nucleotide 29 exclusion characteristic of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs lineages, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV underwent recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from the relief of the selection pressure exerted on the viruses, such as the pressure of the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alphaCoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a change in frames.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure on their reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It is likely that bats are well adapted to anatomically and physiologically VOCs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminating cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the NKG2/CD94 receptor inhibitor of natural exterminating cells, and the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ERO) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress CoV replication and affect exorribonuclease review, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of proteins or new protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
VOCs are non-pathogenic, or at most cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without provoking an elevated host immune response.
This document explains the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of severe cases in human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the overactivation of the immune response and the cytokine cascade, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was disconnected from CoV replication.
The same immune response shutdown strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it was discovered that the betaCoV of bats shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a CoV of bats that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in the markets harbor viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology to SARS-CoV-2, have been discovered, indicating that pangolins may serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or betaCoVs of pangolins may contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by man accidentally or intentionally.
CoVs have returned to worldwide attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of VOCs in bats and other animals drastically changed our perception of the importance of the zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in transmission between humans.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in the bat and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civets in markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in those markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple pangolin betaCoVs strains closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and the mode of this transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels for MERS control, as was done in the wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurring MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, VOCs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities for these zoonotic VOCs to evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new VOCs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crisis, a better response and preparedness plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin puzzle are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide to the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 new coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV). This guide conveys our experience and constitutes a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially dubbed 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is dubbed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted excellent attention since publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in context in some.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple scoring proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We endorse your significant work and express our gratitude.
However, her work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological history with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to comply with three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or other respiratory symptoms from Wuhan;
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the early stage of symptom onset.
The confirmed case diagnosis should be based on a suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequence showing high homogeneity with respect to new known coronaviruses; (3) positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or any change from that SARS-CoV-2-level upward positive to the higher Ig phase; or higher Ig
We can note that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples was added to the second and third editions (from January 18 and 22, 2020, respectively).
Pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth and fifth editions (January 27, 2020 and February 8, 2020, respectively), and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the continued work of researchers in the search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasingly evidence that reminds us to look out for symptomatic and asymptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more studies and clinical practices.
To conclude, we look forward to the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that you check and comply with the latest guidelines from your home countries.
Our team will also update our guide in a timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh Reports Five New Deaths Due to COVID-19, Highest Daily Number
Bangladesh confirmed five more deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic on March 11.
A hospital officer told the Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, which was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, the Bengali minister of road transport and bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be paralyzed for longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport shutdown began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
By March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 surpasses one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections worldwide surged from one million, data from Johns Hopkins University said.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea said it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections until Thursday.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been reported, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that the Russians would continue to be paid without attending work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days. The vote was approved by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the duration of the curfew in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for the entire day. Previously, this duration was only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Australian stores reduce toilet paper limits per transaction
On Saturday and Sunday night, Australian store networks Woolworths and Coles cut restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper, respectively, to two packages and one package per transaction at every store in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a package limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Out of fear of COVID-19, buyers were supposedly stockpiling in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of home-delivery toilet paper to one package per order.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, said that even with the restriction of four packages, “many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery” and called the demand “unprecedented,” while ALDI called it “unexpected” in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales saw a "spicuous increase" last week, according to a spokesman for Woolworths.
Costco’s Canberra store also limited the allowable amount to two packages last week.
To ease the shortage further, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra inventory, while ALDI pre-ordered inventories of a promotion planned for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but that restrictions by the local board on the frequency of deliveries by truck make it difficult.
It expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to carry out the Wednesday promotion.
In a report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores replenish inventory every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that when sold out, it leaves many empty spaces on the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion that if there were an abundant amount on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be [purchased] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday they would be out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces the Sorbent, stressed that they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to a report from News.com.au.
The real estate website domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to early auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being held with buyers entering off the extended Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily print from Darwin, included an eight-page insert to be trimmed and used as toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares a COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — is a pandemic.
While the word “pandemic” indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO stressed the need to push governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and severity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is an “unprecedented” pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that “apart from influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been monitored from the onset to continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we have never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus."
“And we’ve never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO’s January decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the outbreak, “in short, will get worse.”
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuing pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was declared an international public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a distance from people and monitoring and isolating people with suspected infection.
Authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures of establishments.
The pandemic has caused a severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic-triggered purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
In large part, the cases were related to the Huanan seafood wholesaler market and, therefore, the virus is believed to have zoonotic origin.
The outbreak-causing virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has a close link with the bat, pangolin and SARS-CoV coronaviruses. The first person with symptoms of the outbreak became ill on December 1, 2019 and had no visible connections with the later seafood market group.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that one case pointed to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei province, which may have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that as the new cases reported declined in China, but suddenly increased by the first time the number of new cases out of China had exceeded the number of new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK’s top scientific consultant Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive according to official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries adopted official policies not to test only people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection in 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic number of reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being 14 days the most common.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official COVID-19 pandemic death count typically refers to people who died and who had a positive test for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without having taken the test, for example, who died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Italy’s partial data showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that “we know [the official death toll] is underestimated,” a statement corroborated by episodic reports of underreporting in the U.S. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the January H1N1 swine flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan, 9
The first death outside China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
By February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Various measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and by the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given range.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) until April 10, 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, death coefficient estimates dropped from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms between January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die due to a disease, and the mortality rate of non-symptomatic (IFR), which represents
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific population of the infection through the resolution of the case.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the mortality rate of the infection for the pandemic, in general, is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the CFR estimates.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change depending on the location.
Maciej Boni, of Pennsylvania State University, stated that "without proper control, infectious epidemics usually reach their peak and then decline when no more hosts are available for the disease.
But it’s almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when this will occur.”
The Chinese government’s senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, argued that “it can end by June” if all countries mobilize to follow WHO’s recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine declared that SARS-CoV-2 “probably will continue in circulation for a year or two.”
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary “until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, as it is highly transmissible" and "that it could become a seasonal disease, recurring every year."
The virulence of the reappearance will depend on group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unspecific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretion (catarrho), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. The WHO states that approximately one in six people becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms are persistent difficulty breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips with blue coloration. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The progression of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, ophthalmic discomfort, acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming the infection, so researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a person with confirmed infection be monitored and examined closely to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but usually is five days. As an example of the uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their olfactory sensation was initially 30% and subsequently dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is disseminated mainly by close contact and by small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or talking, with close contact being considered 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause droplets to reach from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing droplets can also be produced during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
The droplets may land in the mouths and noses of people close to them or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in airborne spread.
Spread can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their own eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the stool, the risk of this happening is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oral-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There have been positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day in cardboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to humans. However, British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus resemble those of coronaviruses related in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same lineage are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, across the genome level, to other coronavirus samples from bats (BatCoV RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolin virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the entire genome, so far, has found a maximum of 92% share of genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms. The definitive confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography (CT).
A study in Wuhan, comparing rRT-PCR to CT, suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its imaging characteristics coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that “CT should not be used for screening or as a front-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.”
The WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually made available from a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is performed on nasopharyngeal rubbing, although throat rubbing is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting the antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these had proved accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Particularities of X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral matt glass opacity and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is assembling an international online database of imaging results in confirmed cases.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as that by adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of thoracic CT to those of PCR and showed that while the image is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed for the detection of imaging characteristics of the virus with X-rays and CT.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper handkerchief, and placing this handkerchief directly in a waste container.
Those who have been infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and some community members do not know where or how they were infected. Health professionals who care for individuals who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
Governments’ use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits to this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been deployed or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts on how to prevent infection have circulated, such as rinsing their nose and gargling with mouthwashes, which has already proven ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working towards developing one.
Washing your hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty. They should also wash their hands before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol, when soap and water are not readily available.
The WHO advises you to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2–7.5% iodopovidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in a location such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the elbow bent or with a paper tissue when coughing or sneezing, as well as immediately discarding any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of displacement of expiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
The WHO has published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing masks can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene."
The WHO has recommended wearing masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people not touch their own faces.
In several countries, the use of face masks by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face mask made of cloth. China specifically recommended wearing disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming in close contact with another person (being 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a surgical mask when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.
Thailand’s health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks from cloth at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is prohibited to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that everyone wear face mask when leaving public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that anyone entering supermarkets wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has demanded that passengers on intercity trains and buses wear face masks as of April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to wear face masks when going out on the street. At the same time, the production of masks at home was recommended for those who cannot buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves actions of infection control aimed at slowing down the transmission of the disease, by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
Social distancing methods can be applied by everyone while staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping distance from others.
At the moment, many governments are compelling or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in one region) to 50 people and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned social public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face higher risk of serious illnesses and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic. By the end of March 2020, the WHO's "recommended" to the "socialist"
The use of the term "social distance" led to implications that social isolation was needed altogether rather than encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspect they have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have demanded or recommended autoquarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive instructions for autoquarantine have been issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with large-scale transmission were advised to do 14 days of self-quarantine from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
The containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as present other measures of infection control and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce it: the measures taken now serve to slow the speed of the spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time, in combination.
The suppression demands more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic at a basic reproduction rate below 1. The management of an infectious disease outbreak, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. This, we call "elimination of the epidemic curve".
Thus, the risk of overloading health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not of a pharmaceutical nature and that can manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand sanitization, the use of face masks and auto-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of events that lead to agglomerations; community involvement, in order to encourage the acceptance of the situation.
Other countries have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, presented mass screening and localized quarantines, and the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they performed the autoquarantine, and for those who did not, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, the production of face masks has increased and those who stockpiled medical supplies have been punished. Simulations conducted in the UK and the United States show that the reduction (decrease in the speed of contagion, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (i.e., the reversal of the growth of the epidemic) present great challenges.
Optimal reduction policies can reduce the peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half, yet this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, overwhelming at the same time health systems.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as there is circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is the availability of a vaccine, if this occurs earlier. Otherwise, the transmission occurs again as soon as the relaxation of the measures occurs.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug that is specific for COVID-19. However, there are efforts towards drug development, which include testing existing drugs.
The use of cold medicines that do not require a prescription, drinking plenty of fluids and resting can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, the use of oxygen therapy, intravenous insertion of fluids or respiratory aid may be necessary.
The use of steroids can make the condition worse.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some “home and traditional” medicines can alleviate symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
The WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as key measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidance for available hospitals and primary health care services to move their resources at various levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the cancellation of non-mandatory procedures, and the separation and isolation of COV patients for positive testing.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case in the new coronavirus dates from December 1, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian, at the Dobei Provincial Hospital, the next day.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a “SARS-type coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for setting the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, on December 31, made a statement to the population and informed the WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, facilitated by the Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub, as well as a main rail connection point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Subsequent official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy, with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted free movement and established border controls.
Reactions from countries have included containment measures, such as quarantines, 1-million-South Africans are confined (also known as house confinement orders, house confinement orders or lockdown) and curfews. On April 2, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are somehow confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case, November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on Dec. 26. Her hospital reported the Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control on Dec. 27.
Initial genetic tests, on December 27, 2019, on samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronavirus.
A statement to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan doctors were warned by police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed there was no “clear evidence” of transmission between humans.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a “people’s war,” to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a sanitary cord was announced on January 23 to interrupt round trips to and from Wuhan, which has been extended by 15 cities of Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebrations on January 25 have been cancelled in several locations.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to serve more patients.
Along with the newly built hospitals, China has converted 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention centers and stadiums. On January 26, the government launched more measures to curb the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travelers and expanding the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were made in and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
The control of public movement was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) went through some kind of exit restriction. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers arriving in the city. On March 23, mainland China had only one domestic transmission case in five days, in this case, through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had basically been blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China’s Foreign Minister announced on March 26, 2020, that entry of individuals with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details as to when this policy will be terminated.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to companies. The Council of State declared a day of mourning, beginning with a moment of three minutes of silence across the country, on April 4 at 10 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked families to pay their physical tributes on-line, noting
On January 20, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country’s national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On February 22, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The schedule of airlines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world in terms of screening the population for the virus. The country also isolated the infected people and tracked and quarantined those who contact them.
The screening methods included the mandatory individual reporting of symptoms for those arriving from international travel through a mobile app, drive-thru virus testing, with results available the next day, in addition to the increase in testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
The South Korean program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it has not quarantined entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment on the allegation of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was announced that as of April 1, all new arrivals from abroad should be quarantined for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with testing the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantined areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities before the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
Amid allegations of cover-up of the extension of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries traced their cases related to Iran on February 28, indicating that the extension of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government so far.
The Iranian parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members testing positive for the virus on March 3.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch strongly urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The agency said there is a greater risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions such as detention centers, which also suffer from lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number since the outbreak began in the country.
At least 12 current or retired politicians and government officials died as a result of the disease by March 17.
As of March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five times more cases in Iran than is being reported.
It is suggested that U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country’s financial ability to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be alleviated for nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to escalate sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, “In the outbreak areas, people are prohibited from entering and leaving.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On March 4, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities across the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, have to be held behind closed doors by April, but on March 9, all sporting events have been completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding screening protocols that could be employed.
On March 19, Italy passed to China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths related to the pandemic.
On March 22, it was announced that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical supplies to Italy.
As of April 5, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus until then may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the mildest of the affected countries, and by March 18, 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the acknowledged lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement advising the interruption of all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work from home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and academies, should be closed as soon as possible, and committed to pay 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distancing measures, preventing the necessary free air travel with more than two people and resting.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police through the issuance of fines and scattering of agglomerations.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with exceptions for businesses considered “essential,” including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and auto shops.

Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start to testing, which hid the true extent of the outbreak at that time.
The test was marked by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal government approval for test kits that were not from the government (from academies, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to be tested by the beginning of March (a medical request was subsequently required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been performed.

On the other hand, China’s aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid panic near the lunar New Year festivities."
On January 23, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea stated that the first ICHI measure since 2009 was "that was certainly not a WHO recommendation" and it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On January 30, after the confirmation of the transmission among humans outside China and the increase in the number of
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was invoked due to the “risk of global dissemination, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and displacement."
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency of assisting these countries that "do not have systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it arises."
Tedros later made statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community to "invest now or will have to pay later." On 11 February, the WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros declared that United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to provide “the power of the entire United Nations system in response.”
The United Nations Crisis Management Team was activated as a result, enabling coordination of the entire United Nations response, which the WHO declares will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and developmental implications resulting from the outbreak.”
On February 14, a Joint WHO Mission Team with China was empowered to declare a phase of "declaring that the international experts and the WHO on the ground in China would provide much assistance in domestic management" and to assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through workshops and meetings with leading national-level institutions and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the levels of provinces and municipalities, including the urban and rural panoramas".

Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready,” insisting that the right response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan also stated that the current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that “we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said the WHO was “deeply concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction.” The WHO faced much criticism for what was seen as an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a petition to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to present his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, the UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for managing the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Administrators at the provincial level of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been fired because of their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian rejected an early recognition of the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese Virus” or “Wuhan Virus” saying that China’s censorship “overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and “a way to deflect the administration’s failure to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained from a U.S. government cable a detailed communication ploy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being cited as "This has everything to do with China.
"Channels such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have indicated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus is part of propaganda for global influence.
The head of foreign policy of the European Union, Josep Borrell, warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a biased viewpoint and 'politics of generosity".
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and trustworthy partner.”
China has also called on the United States to suspend its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending aid to those same countries.
Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.

This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous “high-level political source” that 80 percent of Russia’s supplies were “useless or of little use for Italy.”
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The President of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good state, they would also act reciprocally if necessary.”
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be maintained on a small scale.
The Secretary General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders calling for help on March 14, 2020, saying his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has prompted the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care and paid family leave.
Political analysts have anticipated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of reelection as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan’s ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated locations.
South Korean society was initially polarized about President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment of what they called improper management of the outbreak, or praising his response. The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency laws in response.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those deemed to have spread false news about the virus and the government's management of the crisis.
The Coronavirus outbreak has been to blame for several cases of supply shortages, resulting from increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of factory operations and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and supplier interruptions.
Several locations also experienced the panic-motivated shopping event which led to empty shelves of essentials such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortages of supplies.
The tech industry in particular has warned of delays in shipping electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protective equipment has risen 100 times.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that it would put workers’ health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of baby formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and in the Wuhan region, and the resulting high demand for food products, both areas were spared from an acute food shortage.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding the acute food shortages that have been predicted in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not observed a large reduction, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released reserves of pork to ensure adequate feeding of the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China was hit heavily in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to curtail the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5 percent.
As mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist’s intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of possible outcomes emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the epidemic’s economic impact on global growth could outpace the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate from an expert at the University of Washington at St. Louis indicated a $300 billion impact on the world’s supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly "confused" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the Coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock market indices including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones industry average demonstrated their most expressive drops since 2008, with the Dow drop by 1,191 points, the biggest drop in a day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three other indices ended the week with a drop greater than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH asserted China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again based on concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest drop on March 16.
Many consider it a likely economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the states and central banks’ timely emergency measures.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, the closure of public places including sights, and the recommendation of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry has been of an unprecedented level.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year’s festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass crowds, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, officials extended the New Year’s holiday to February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen by this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its level of infectious disease response to the highest level and declared emergency, closing schools by March and cancelling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.
Reseller visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Resellers in North America and the Middle East saw a drop of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43 percent drop in pedestrian traffic to malls in March compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as greater cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers were abandoned at home in inland provinces or imprisoned in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government help.
The Coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States in 2020 and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily pay) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of the Canadian households have lost the job in the United States.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment aid and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit program. Nearly half a million companies in Germany placed their workers under government-subsidized reduced-hour work programs known as Kurzabeit.
The German reduced-hour remuneration program was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as people – both employees and independents – worldwide.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritages to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and help artists where possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have taken place to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerating repercussion of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion events.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week rites in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the Christian Lenten period, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have advised elderly Christians to stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches have made church services available via radio, live streaming online or television while others offer drive-in-style cults.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter’s Square empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran’s health ministry announced Friday’s cancellation of prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and sanctuaries were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned entry of foreign pilgrims as well as their residents to sacred sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to start in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled for a date after 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021". Casinos and other game venues around the world have been closed and face-to-face poker tournaments have also been postponed or canceled.
This has led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with several music groups suspending or cancelling their tours.
Many great theaters like Broadway have also cancelled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work online as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live-streamed shows or creating online “festivals” for artists to perform, share and disseminate their work.
Online, several memes on the internet about the coronavirus are propagated, as many seek humor and entertainment amid uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism directed at people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people from focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, mistrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February results (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserving of the virus or being given fair punishment for what they provoked.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is targeted at those in the areas affected by the virus.
Following the advance of the outbreak in new outbreak countries, citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pushing for the ban on the entry of Chinese countries into the country.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to Twitter Trending Topics.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuated Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which borders China, and students in major cities in India have allegedly suffered persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the unit in the Bharatiya Janata Party state in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese destroyed nature and "that's the reason why God turned against them."
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, who called it "mistakers". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign garbage" and "discard" targets.
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them from some or all of the coverage on the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have made available scientific articles related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and developed only to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (sorology) can be used for population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who became asymptomatic.
An accurate rate of disease mortality and herd immunity level in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests performed in countries.
This variability is likely to still substantially affect the mortality rates of recorded cases, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharynx smear or saliva sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours or in 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharynx smear is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternatively, sample material can be removed from the bottom of the airways by suction catheter or sputum expelled material (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the public RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive approval for emergency use from China's National Medical Products Administration for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Center for Control and Prevention of Corona-CoV-2 is distributing its laboratory for real time.
One of three genetic tests on older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests for faulty reagents, and a test impediment at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout the month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then were local and state laboratories allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for RT-PCR-based COVID-19.
Quest Diagnostics has also made COVID-19 testing nationally available as of March 9, 2020.
No quantity restrictions have been announced; sample collection and processing should be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Sanitary Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (U.S.A.) to Abbott Labs for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S. FDA test for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology, rather than PCR.
As it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and specifically binds it to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "thorax x-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, may be present even before the onset of symptoms."
Typical characteristics in CT include bilateral multilobar opacities in matte glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging aspects coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for an initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals started 7 days ago or soon after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to monitor the population. Assays can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by means of remote laboratory tests (PoCT).
High productivity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by cutaneous puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection step is not required before the test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency as required, and from now on they are able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
The testability is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
Antibodies are normally detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the UK considered that none of the acquired antibody test kits were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which suspicious patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sampling tube to the patient", they must expel saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result shortly after. The British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test the suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they go to the hospital or need them.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea perform some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, of which 10,700 had been tested the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several major cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that from the 12th week of 2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were sampled by the B-tested by the B-tested by the B-tested by the B-tested by the B-tested by the B-tested by the B-tested by the B-tested by the B-tested by the B-tested by the B-tested by the B-tested.
With the construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled had this test capability not had online access.
The Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by the Huo-Yan laboratories in in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily yield was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed models released by Origami Assays were released as capable of testing up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19, using only 93 assays. These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic manipulators for the liquids.
In March, shortages or insufficient amounts of reagent became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the US.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols involving heating the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was reported that the UAE is now doing more per capita testing in its population for the coronavirus than other countries, and would be on track to increase the level of the coronavirus.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capability, and acquisition of a population-scale mass processing laboratory of Group 42 and BGI (inspired by its “Huo-Yan” emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to operate outside of China.
Different testing methods for different components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method for the manufacture of kits shipped to low-income countries that have no resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Center for Disease Control was not available until January 28, there was a delay in testing available to the U.S. and China, and the U.S. faced problems with the reliability of test kits right at the start of the outbreak.
In contrast, experts say South Korea’s wide availability for testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The test capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs as the best way to slow the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private U.S. laboratories, and the supply of cotton swabs and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems accurately in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a failure to collect samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The minister of Spain said he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China generated incorrect results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million test kits from China considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that it would not "use them". The UK acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not useful.
Testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and monitoring of those with whom SARS-CoV-2 positive people had contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two stages of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases found were quarantined.
With the shift to the restricted commune, this eliminated new infections altogether.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 in Singapore has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as mandatory closure of restaurants and sales outlets.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began seriously advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened within schedule after the holidays on March 23.
Many other countries have also administered the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that the countries that performed the most tests in relation to the number of deaths had more lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect those with no or little symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have test capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" is influenced by the test policy of the countries.
A country that tests only people in hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand sanitation, is the act of washing hands for the purpose of removing dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Hand washing with soap constantly at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as the flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap are important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child’s butt or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, frank or fish.
If soap and water are not available, the hands can be sanitized with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand sanitation:
Before, during, and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, feed or animal waste.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main purpose of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and decreasing the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study found that best practices for handwashing can cause small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to poor areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes may be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), such as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main IRA, is the leading cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhea deaths by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections in one room.
Handwashing is usually associated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin injury due to dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a condition of peeling and skin irritation known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Frequent hand washing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (watering, defecation), after cleaning a child's butt (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other situations when the correct handwashing technique should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cut or injury; after sneezing, coughing or nosing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of children had the habit of washing hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest index with 97 percent; the United States was close to the average with 77 percent; and China with the lowest index with 23 percent. Various methods for changing hands in the hands in the countries with the highest rate of washing.
The “Essential Health Services Program” implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large-scale action to promote children’s health and education.
Deworming twice a year, complemented by washing your hands daily with soap, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleansing agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic dirt, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated bar soap concluded that transmission is unlikely as the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic dosing commands is preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been widely disseminated to the health-conscious public.
To date, there is no indication that using antiseptics or recommended disinfectants can lead to the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, the complex formulas can contain final consumer acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts remove). A comprehensive analysis of the effective anti-acetic acid, ascorbic acid, anti-lactic acid and anti-lactic acids.
Warm water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37oC).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove the natural oiliness that retains dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous base hand sanitizing agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-aqueous base hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, antiseptic hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as the carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a humectant, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers that contain a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to the 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands, 30 seconds after their application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after their application. Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost totally ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptics or alcohol-based sanitizers can be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The backs and palms of your hands, between your fingers and your ends, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed, being rubbed with both palms. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with hand sanitizers, especially when the hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid exterminatory action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause skin dryness, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less irritation and dryness on the skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives present in alcohol-based hand sanitizers rarely occur.
The lesser tendency to provoke irritative contact dermatitis became an attractive one when compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous base agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water for preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of hand sanitizers without alcohol is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and has historically fallen far short of alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford a soap and instead use ash or earth.
Gray or earth may be more effective than pure water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash are contaminated with microorganisms, the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands with cold or hot running water.
It is advisable to use running water as fixed sinks may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem to be relevant.
Rub your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap instead of pure water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for a longer time removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Washing in a sink can recontamine your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let it dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are most easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chiped enamel can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep your hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or bar with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "improvised taps" and other options.
An improvised faucet is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a lever driven by the feet to pour a small amount of water into the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand sanitation process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
A growing volume of research suggests that towel papers are far more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by paper towel, hand dryers with heated air and the most modern hand dryers with air jets.
After washing and drying hands with heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the area of the palm near the fingers and 254% higher in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air-jet dryers caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the area of the palm near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the area of the palm near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. The researchers also conducted tests to determine whether there was potential for cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air-jet dryer, which projects air out of the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the unit potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment within 2 meters away.
The use of hand dryer with hot air spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towel.
Hand washing with moistened hand sanitizers is an alternative to lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical handwashing became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind the hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
Clinical hand washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to soap and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the entanglement of the fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents the recontamination of the hands by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that lack of handwashing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can lower the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and friction in the health system sectors.
The draft guidance for the hygiene of the hands of the organization can also be found on this website for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soaps "medicinal" or "antimicrobial") confers an exterminating action on a hand washing agent.
Such an exterminatory action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" your hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, some antiseptics of chlorhexidine or iodine, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water on the forearms should not drain into the hands.
After hand washing is finished, the hands are wiped with a sterile towel and the surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after attending a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and a little significant additional benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Common soap washing more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap.Comparing hand sanitization with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds for each revealed that the antibacterial hand sanitizer in an alcohol-based 2
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands. Interventions to increase hand sanitization in hospital settings can involve team awareness about hand washing, increased availability of hand sanitizers and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most efficient in different health facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable water sources, soap or handwashing resources in people’s homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the achievement of the universal practice of handwashing.
For example, in most rural Africa handwashing taps near any public or private toilets are rare, despite cheap options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates can instead be the result of rooted habits rather than the absence of soap and water.
The encouragement and advocacy of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of handwashing and provoke a long-term change in the behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF’s “Three-Star Approach” that encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among others.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the top three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations may be part of the promotional campaigns for handwashing carried out with the aim of reducing disease and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that tries to bring about a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF announced the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries relative to DALY classification.
However, one analysis suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health - especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors to hand sanitation: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand sanitation as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "proper handwashing techniques" were hung next to handwashing sinks in public toilets and in bathrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression “washing your hands” means declaring a reluctance to take responsibility or to be convicted of something.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a more general phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and usually attach more importance to handwashing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of "cleaning", such as volunteering.
The symbolic handwashing, using water, but not soap, to wash the hands is part of a ritual handwashing characteristic in many religions, including the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, the Tevilah, and the netilat yadayim hands in Judaism, the abgic basin in Christianity.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam authorize handwashing after toilet use.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam authorize handwashing before and after meals.
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational health and safety methodologies for hazard controls for the prevention of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Appropriate hazard controls in the workplace depend on the workplace and the work itself, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 contraction.
According to the Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), functions with lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory label, and a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Functions at average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or direct contact with people about whom it is not known whether they are contaminated or suspected of COVID-19 contamination, but may be infected due to existing community transmission or because they have travelled abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public such as in schools, high population density workplaces, and in the large-volume retail market.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with used high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and provision of personal protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that health care workers who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures on people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 aerosol generation and collect or handle specimens from those people.
Suitable hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they become ill, because they have to take care of other people, or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which products are in demand and the means of purchasing those products (such as shopping outside peak hours or for delivery or drive-through services).
Finally, the dispatch of items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors for individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the necessary controls to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action and preparation plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Targets for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission between employees, protecting people who are at higher risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a framework widely used in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls for effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, ultimately, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and may be the most cost-effective implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes to the work policy or procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected on the basis of the hazard to the worker, appropriately adjusted as needed (breathers, for example), used appropriately and continuously, inspected regularly, preserved and replaced as needed, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of appropriately to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), jobs with low risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, and the use of the respiratory label, including covering the sneezing and coughing, preparation of containers for tissues and common garbage, preparation for the working and other work environments, and cleaning of the worker’s work and of the stepped-outs.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they have no more fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or alleviate other symptoms, and also recommends that an employee’s home leave policies be flexible, allow them to stay at home.
According to OSHA, jobs at average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known to be confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to current community transmission in the company’s locality, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad, in a country with high COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who have contact with the general public such as the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours and of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours of the working hours.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolating the sick person from other people by a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer him a face mask, or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with coughing or sneezing wipes.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a biohazard waste bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other vessels with passengers, hazard controls include postponing the journey by the sick passenger, self-isolation, and immediate communication to the onboard medical center if someone presents fever or other symptoms during the journey.
For schools and childcare centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large groups such as physical education classes or corals, or meals at a diner, increasing the space between the tables, stricter arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using a separate health care facility for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, prolonged school dispensations may be considered. For law enforcement authorities that carry out daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who come into contact with individuals with suspected COVID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during the seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common cleaning spray or cloth and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain workers in the health and mortuary sector to be in high or very high exposure risk categories.
Functions with high risk of exposure include drug delivery, medical care, laboratory and medical transportation workers, who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive collection of specimens.
Work in high-exposure morgues include workers involved in preparing bodies of people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease, including when aerial generator procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure may be appropriate in some scenarios of nectars and in the health area.
Specimens should be handled with caution of biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering the hospital be separated into two distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals working at a distance of 6 feet from patients with confirmation or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 particle-filtered facial respirators, approved by NIOSH or superior quality respirators, should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend wearing overalls, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
The WHO recommends only a surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
For professionals collecting respiratory specimens, treating or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol generation procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial protection, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 respirator or FFP2.
Since the overall supply of PPEs is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPEs through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care for patients to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing the PPEs while treating multiple patients with the same PPE.

We are in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Their challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and community building, which are the foundations of this organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a remarkable validation of the amazing human beings with whom we have the privilege to work.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have you all as co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
This person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful it is that this essential feature remains online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible because you keep workplaces active, pay our co-workers, and keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but the way we do will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the coming days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we think is an appropriate action to what we are experiencing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this period.
We want to end stress and support our mission in the long term.
If you need to be away for a while, no problem.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily work expectation will be 4 hours, or 20 hours per week, until otherwise provided.
We're not declaring a holiday. If you can work at normal hours, it could be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy groceries or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
This rule would not even need to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
No attestation or paid leave is required. Just tell your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification sector so that his or her sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention.)
Personnel who work on an hourly basis will receive full payment.
We have said this before, and we are committed to honoring our commitment to our contractors and employees who work on an hourly basis.
Everyone will receive their salaries based on their normal work record under normal circumstances.
Wages depend on whether you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give full support to you.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remember that your well-being is more important.
We only ask you to communicate to your manager, so that we know what to expect and can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to carry out.
Site Reliability, HR, Reliability and Security and Fundraising (among others) teams perform essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is a lot to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us in the future.
We have no intention of “double work to recover lost time” after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and that employees prioritize essential work, personal care, and care for loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a shorter journey in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual planning team for their leadership in this process.
Office Status, Exposure and Cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our co-workers in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, as a precaution, we employed an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and all the elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is employing its own due diligence protocol using products that are safe for its visitors.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located at a WeWork, which shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all Washington employees.
Last week, our Washington office moved to a totally remote setup, in line with the San Francisco shared guide.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing the lease of an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
Limit the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider dividing them into several days.
Define the meeting, have a schedule and send in advance materials for reading.
Use videos as standard, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom for easy collaboration and real-time connection.
Have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone to monitor questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency aids to buy snacks.
Join the #remotes channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to help increase remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the editing marathons, until the WHO declares an end to the pandemic.
We warn you that we understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete your agreed subsidization activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying their goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The overall feeling in the world community seems to be sadness with the shutdown, but also relief with the clarity and ability to keep focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Staying up-to-date on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with employees.
We will use that time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with whatever it takes.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company wiki.
The Communication Resources team will update these pages and all information in a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees who live in countries significantly affected today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, be sure to notify you and work with the communication resources team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, email Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations at HR.
None of these changes should be seen as abandonment of our work and obligations.
They are, however, an acknowledgment that at this point our work and obligations will probably need to adapt in a way that we haven’t adapted to in the past.
These are the steps we believe are needed as support right now, so we can keep working, providing our movement with the support it needs and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and make room for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months to come.
We need all of you for this to happen, so we need all of you to take care of yourself and your family so that they are in their best condition when needed.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug aimed at treating cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also functions as a point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 is a metalloenzyme that contains zinc located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and a C-terminal amino acid and collectrin transporter domain in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-pass type 1 membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of major pulmonary alveolar type II cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
Expression of ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE cleaves the hormone angiotensin type I into angiotensin type II causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn cleaves carboxyterminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-H-Ile-Pro-Gist-O).
ECA2 also cleaves several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and was implicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the main point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike protein S1 to the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the serine-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to hypothesize that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing with the ACE inhibitor standard and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls.”
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Human recombinant ECA2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and it appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with a lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications to assist monitoring in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures for creating contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues have been raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographic location of the users of the application.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with a person with COVID-19.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be ceded to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and offer a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government declared that the contact tracking app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar app is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand plan applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential absence of efficacy if app acceptance is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful “coronavirus” apps, Apple sets limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them only to “official” or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
Surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have suspension clauses;
the use of the data should be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid the aggravation of discrimination and marginalisation;
any data sharing with third parties should be provided for by law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking engine from its device operating systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy-conserving systems have been created to use central servers only for intercom (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a unique app, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate text message alerts to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also made location information publicly available, which is allowed due to comprehensive changes to information confidentiality laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralized one.
Until April 6, 2020, details had not yet been disclosed.
Contact tracking preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography dating back to at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-friendly solutions, with the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that encompasses centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized privacy-Preservation Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) and other Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (ACT).
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during the collection and use of location or cross-path data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication "Applications play dirty: keeping personal privacy in an epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a company that develops privacy technologies and originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and managers, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that came together around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of alerting and tracking applications, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the government’s official app, became open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system provides for implementation in three stages:
Development of tools to enable the government to create official coronavirus tracking applications while preserving privacy
Integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to address persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system for system updates in operation, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug reproposal, reperfilation, reassignment or therapeutic substitution) is the reproposal of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research targets include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 druggable proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these binding points provides the reasonable design of effective antiviral drug development against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that he then perfected and analyzed for their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in his preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a drug against malaria that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an Emergential Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised through the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who are unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors said they are using the drug when “there is no other option.”
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are ongoing at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 pneumonia patients, half were treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency has reminded the population that the existing evidence to base the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to stockpile it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for the Trump administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about targeting resources to reproduce drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later found that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against phylum, pneumonia, paramyx and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which can cause transmissions or more serious diseases.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate illness and one for those with more severe illness.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for people hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19: two of them are placebo-controlled (in China and Canada), while the other does not present a control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial of Alvesco (ciclesonide), from the company Teijin, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with an angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the efficacy of the treatment.
At the moment, researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are researching the role of colchicine in reducing lung complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, which did not have to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women who are breastfeeding or who do not use effective contraceptive methods were not included in the tests.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin, low molecular weight, is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which has prompted the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study, with 300 patients, is examining the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and in therapeutic dosages. The study was announced on April 14, in Italy.
Due to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable to give new purpose to antiviral drugs approved and developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as capable of receiving a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus disease vaccine (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with clinical trials completed, there are several attempts underway to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A large spread of the outbreak occurred in 2020, which led to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, declared in April that the needs for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 diverse technology platforms being researched and developed during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The goals of the major platforms that have advanced to Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute).
A Phase I-II test performs the preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (follow preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular staple, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, with the goal of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at China’s Center for Disease Prevention and Control on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotech partner Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine with technology similar to that used for vaccination therapy against neoantigens.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and were starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immnuno-Oncology, announced that they were initiating a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a candidate for the vaccine that could be tested on humans "in the next 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington at St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for pre-clinical testing and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, India’s Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated pace, it would take at least a year and a half and two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in research in the lab, with human testing planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian stated that U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac “large sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine” in protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, a candidate mRNA-based vaccine, currently in preclinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could go for human testing in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a research consortium for the COVID-19 vaccine involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, taking CEPI’s total $29 million investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.
The other investment partners of CEPI for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun testing animals on six different candidates for the vaccine.
Researchers at Imperial College in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receipt of the China sequencing.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced $192 million specifically to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other outbreaks of the Coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in rats, stating that "MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines that elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses [in the mouse] that were evident to be initiated 2 weeks later."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a candidate for a DNA-based vaccine as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities joined forces to access IBM supercomputers in combination with cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means they can have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A subsequent randomized test in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine using specimens of animals specific for COVID-19, such as the transgenic ACE2-mouse, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates a need for Level 3 biosafety containment measures to handle live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have already been tested on non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful model for vaccine development and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that completed phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three other vaccines in progress, all of which are virus-vectored vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other Coronavirus strains such as the Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some evolve to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have already healed themselves. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced when they exhale, they usually fall to the ground or remain on surfaces instead of remaining infectious over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first 3 days after onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
Wearing masks is recommended for people with suspicion of the virus and for people responsible for its care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others require use.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries by all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty staying awake, bluish face or lips.
Less common, upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease can evolve into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop the symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role these asymptomatics play in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people without symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking loudly releases more droplets than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally carried by air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that transmission by bioaerosol may be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside people’s rooms contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore airborne.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through the stool, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to be transmitted before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, usually one person infects one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in 99% copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Products with soap degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, deactivating it, as well as removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, while the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells through the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in the alveolar cells type II of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spice" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is most frequent in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high thanks to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsy of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for respiratory tract epithelial cells expressing ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic T cells that secrete GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with recruitment of IL-6 secretory inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrators have also been reported in necropsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or catarrh sample may be used.
The results are usually available in a few hours up to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, tests using antibodies (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience with the test has shown that its accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University’s Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in bilateral multilobar matte glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common at the onset of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (thickened lobular septums with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypical large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands without washing.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, as well as covering your mouth with the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC has recommended wearing cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public meetings.
Distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from each other.
Since the vaccine should not be released before 2021, a key point for controlling COVID-19 is to try to decrease the peak of the epidemic, also known as "curve curving".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using alcohol-based hand antiseptic with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where commercial hand antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity occurs through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepty".
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are with the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under analysis.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms and in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive doctors and pneumologists from the U.S. have gathered treatment recommendations from various agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risks of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures are being performed that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with airborne infection isolation (SIIA) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions and aerial precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blanket, respirator or face mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to wear respirators instead of face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has approved the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (U.S.).
They are designed to protect against aerial particles such as dust, but their efficacy against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undescribed uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be prevented with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure at two levels.
Whether either of these two leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the aerosol particles to spread, compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in the elderly (those over 60 and especially over 80).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of the health system to cope with the sudden escalation in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China noted that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans that have pressure control mode and high PEEP level are required to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung and pneumothorax injuries associated with ventilation.
High level PEEP may not be available on older fans.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials are being conducted with various antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
While new drugs may take until 2021 to be developed, several of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are in the advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral medication can be tested in people with various diseases.
The WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in the testing of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has given temporary authorization for the use of plasma from convalescent people as a treatment in cases where the person’s life is seriously and immediately threatened.
The necessary clinical studies to show its safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been carried out.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to provide their name and ID number.
The application can detect the "near contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities. Big data analysis of mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people they have had contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who are allegedly coronavirus-infected.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect people who may come into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect who fails to quarantine.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that “40% of people continue to circulate anyway.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackaton over the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience quarantine difficulties, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “The increase in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may have a mild progression, with few or no symptoms, appearing to be other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as a cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness can take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 data is lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of hospitals with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the median manifestation of initial symptoms until death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of lung post-mortem samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic alterations have been observed in pneumocytes.
The lung imaging examination looked like acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission, heart damage was detected due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
Comorbidity mortality estimates vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The underreporting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die, compared to nonsmokers. Concerns were raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authority found a 20 to 30 percent drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who have recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as probable, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worsening of a prolonged infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and animal-derived, through overflow infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of symptom onset was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of symptom onset as December 8, 2019.
Various measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency disease codes ICD-10 U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given range.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) on April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the rate of lethality by case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the rate of lethality by infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not restricted to time and follow a specific population from infection to resolution of the case.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 should have been formally recorded as such.
Moreover, the German health care system was not overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3% can have antibodies, as seen in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had confirmed death from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in their 50s, with the difference between men and women only approaching their 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to sex, lower prevalence of smoking women and the development by men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data from sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, mostly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020, that the disease’s official name was “COVID-19.”
The head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, explained that "CO" is from "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", of disease and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 has been called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “the COVID-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19” in communications to the public.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called the "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronaviruses" and "Wuhan coronaviruses".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV" as interim names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 guidance against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal hoaxes and respirator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on the required schedule, a local startup reverse engineered and printed the necessary 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is ongoing in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY Trial” to assess the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with most likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the integral virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the protein in the spicle that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There have been more than 300 clinical trials underway since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs makes up most of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries due to a report from late April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There has been an attempt to prove the efficacy of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir by compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for a parity review of the survey.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be further studied in vivo after having demonstrated low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicle protein in preparation for serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have great limitations that prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-storm properties of cytokine. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the conclusion of a small study.
A non-randomized phase 2 national-level test is underway in Italy, having demonstrated positive results in people with the severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of death for some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people in need of them is being investigated as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of recovered patients’ blood and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus Diseases, a group of strongly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
