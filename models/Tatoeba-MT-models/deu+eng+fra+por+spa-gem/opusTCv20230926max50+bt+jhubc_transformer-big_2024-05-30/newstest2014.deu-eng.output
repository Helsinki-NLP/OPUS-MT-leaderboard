Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian ramp at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - in sight of the older city hall temples.
Two installations so close to each other: intention or shield citizens coup?
That question was clearly answered by the mayor of Gutach yesterday.
“The city hall was installed at the time because it secures the school path,” Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9>.
"For their safety, the high traffic and pedestrians had to have another traffic light," Eckert said.
Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg also confirmed this.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," emphasizes Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is just going to happen here," Arnold said.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, a roundabout was also envisaged, but due to the narrowness in the intersection Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was tested beforehand when choosing the location of the traffic lights: "We tested whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without bending the traffic lights by means of an extra truck loaded for us with particularly long logs".
The traffic light system itself, which costs around 15,000 euros, is "the most modern thing currently available on the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that are so bright that the lights can be easily recognized by the drivers, for example, even when the sun is at low.
And it is also economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per driving direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
“If a group or people with walking disabilities are to walk across the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone is safely coming over the roadway,” Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver must think here as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: the traffic lights for pedestrians barely showed green, a high-class vehicle roared through - with bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the tendency to raw violence and blunt sexuality, the tightness and joylessness - have been described by the Carinthian poet many times.
The Büchner Prize winner is best known as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from prose texts Gerhard Fresacher compiles a collage of prose texts for his performance "Weather lights at the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in Garage X at Petersplatz.
The theater maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prerequisite: a crushed sofa, on which is implying copulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance covers the template with an abundance of directing incidents, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses get involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, dipped with their head under water, patched to the wall with their evening robes.
Entrained in cellophane or bodice, they stake on dangerously high studs through the staging, either monologize loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly conveyed in this strenuous way.
The best moments are when the evening is sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the overturned performance come to rest a bit, and Winkler's just afterwards absurd humour flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits in the dashboard of every car.
The devices that record every mile driven and report the information to authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have teamed up with environmental groups and advocate that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres it has traveled – and possibly where they have been traveled – and then use the information to calculate tax bills.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
However, while there is no agreement in Congress on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently considering how to switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’re only potentially going to use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record miles driven by all California drivers in the state starting in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes Americans pay at the gas station, is bankrupt.
But in America, there is not as much fueling as it used to be.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per liter) has not risen in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by a cent at high fuel prices.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful alternative in the long run,” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is appealing to urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in a way that reduces congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
The California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally enshrined climate change goals.
But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also fascinated by the idea of having drivers pay for the distance they have traveled.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move toward mileage-based billing.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would include 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of deputies from rural areas, who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most engaged is Oregon, which is currently hiring 5,000 drivers for the nation’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the petroleum tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical about thinking that the government could track any of their movements.
“Concerning Big Brother and things like that were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and earnings management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
As the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website, “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult monitoring devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is among a number of states now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to track the miles it has traveled, but not exactly when and where.
This, Khan said, would also be more reassuring to the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not appear to help states in the taxation of drivers.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay based on the miles driven.
But the devices she tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information, which is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all the residents of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation that can also be used to pay parking fees, have to pay insurance only for driven kilometers, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
“Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits that the system offers,” the city’s planning document states.
However, some traffic planners wonder if all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction maneuver.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for surgery if an aspirin is enough,” said Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats themselves sharply
The volunteer fire brigade handled their main autumn rehearsal with bravery despite a shortage of personnel.
Only 11 people participated in the exercise.
Division Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Straße in his practice acceptance.
There is said to have been a short circuit during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respirators of the Wehr made themselves ready to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead them out into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw bales in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first releasing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was carried out via an overflow hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now three clearance attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what can be achieved with little available staff.
In the event of an emergency, support is provided through the Königsfeld Tageseinsatzgruppe.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow come from.
At the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he investigated this important issue together with the managing directors of the Vocational Schools as well as the district high school and the chairmen of the parental board.
"Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and Berufsschulzentrum in the Waldstadt.
He also praised family friendliness in the county.
"It is important to keep an eye not only on the family phase, but also on the phase of caring for relatives due to demographic change," Wolf said.
In addition, he said that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to a termination of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned about the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, often remain in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the president of the Landtag.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
"Stay persistent and ensure that public transport is improved," he told the local politicians.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For the past 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then a Vesper.
In the past, the older citizens were accommodated in the resting place.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place at the St. Josef nursing home.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
With popular melodies, Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were entertaining.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old school courtyard before the renovation to the church road is to be put again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angular wall was installed during the first works of renovation of the front school yard, to stabilize and static relief of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further procedure envisages incorporating the Landdenkmalamt in the planning and creating a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be made by experts, which will then be placed on the table to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made as early as next year.
After the refurbishment, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the foreseeable follow-up action is to be renovated from the ground up and put on new substructures.
The historic, one hundred-year-old boundary wall of the old school courtyard to the church road is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, in need of renovation and has a bow inclination towards the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, however the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use schoolyard, which has been achieved by the current fortification work.
The renovation of schoolyards was originally planned in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenses brought a shift.
An important word in the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be spoken by the Landdenkmalamt.
Should specifications come from this site, then the city of Bräunlingen is hoping for grants from the monument protectors.
The students of the Bräunlinger Elementary School, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new classroom, will soon be able to use the old school courtyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has now also been involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir told the Stuttgarter Nachrichten.
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz venue Stuttgart.
Özdemir, who is considered to be a favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, opposes the Green-Red state government.
Based on an expert study, this is forcing a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, among other things, the degree programme Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
U.S. border: 'Super tunnel' to drug smuggling discovered
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a “super tunnel” for drug smuggling.
According to U.S. customs authorities, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
The tunnel was reportedly not yet in use.
"These cartels are stupid when they think they could dig under the radar," U.S. District Attorney General Laura Duffy said at a press conference outside a warehouse in San Diego where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Duffy said: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the U.S. authorities and Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated wagons could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened with life imprisonment as a maximum penalty, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, the San Diego press conference said.
This is the first time cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Usually, cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts rather than through tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have been cut, said Bill Sherman of the drug investigation DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were disclosed about the detainees, at least one being Mexican, it was said.
You will have to expect prison sentences of up to 10 years.
2014 is Geisinger festive year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in eight weeks, the anniversary year is over.
Geisingen and church houses were mentioned for the first time in 794.
In churches, a document has been issued in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15th there will be an official kick-off to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be held in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July the 1250.
Celebrate the return.
On Fridays with a festive act, on Saturdays and Sundays with a feast around the church halls.
This holiday weekend is also the Church-House Church Festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commission composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Club, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger Stadtjubiläum, a new chronicle will also be released.
"But it should become a chronicle not only of Geisingen themselves, but a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the singing of today is also celebrating 2014 birthday, in 1974 the current spatial dimension was completed with the congregations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on November 21 or 22 in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is another year with many anniversaries.
Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 and has the festive banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Fountain Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first documented in a gift certificate, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was produced in churches (houses), which at that time was the courthouse.
Both municipalities are mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year-old in 2014 is also 40 years old.
Council targets track systems
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be elaborately rebuilt to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the councils have decided.
Schiltach has to pay 220,000 euros for this.
Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety at railway crossings is to be increased - regularly collisions of trains with other vehicles occur nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they have to share with a third of the costs, the rest share railway and federal.
Schiltach city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality council the special features of the Bah transition "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the level of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track.
There, larger vehicles, for example those that transport long timber, could also stand in counter-traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grieshaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could widen the adjacent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed controversially in the municipality council, as some councillors doubted the need for street spreading: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, drew the mood of critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money in hand because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-wood transports.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partially transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition, the route serves as a redirect for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
Since it is foreseeable that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and rehabilitated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic importance for a longer period.
The councils agreed to have the cost of expanding the road investigated.
Nevertheless, the majority agreed to the reconstruction of the railway crossing on the condition that the required support wall is built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" if necessary for encounter traffic to around 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access in the strongly rising "Groltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had had the railway’s reconstruction plans examined by the engineering office of Breinlinger, since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Weg would then be possible without further delay.
The investigation concluded that it cannot be ruled out that the inclination of the road could cause longer vehicles to sit on the road.
The city, in turn, is responsible for this as a road load carrier.
The reconstruction could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the removal of wood and the bending functioned in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, argued Haas.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is considerably lower than at the other railway crossings, because there is directly adjacent to the stop point center to which a good visual connection exists.
Even trains from the main train station would have to be slowed down at this point so that no collision could occur.
The majority refused to accept the reconstruction of this railway crossing, as the city of Schiltach would have to "bath out" the problem with seated vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work has been completed.
The panel considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" to be unproblematic, for which intersection agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - European Space Agency experts must now agree on two major projects they want to start in the coming years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already been found by astronomers.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should we look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These questions are being asked by the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are designed to drive research forward decisively.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros in each case.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were debated, five of which have now come into closer election.
Numerous committees review the proposals, hook up with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the scientific programme committee.
In total, Esa has selected four major questions to be answered by the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme initiated in 2007.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds – and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars – are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To address this issue, in 2017 the space telescope "Cheops" is to be launched, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity will be investigated in more detail.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, thus searching for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
In the end, this question should also provide information about the prerequisites for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field, as well as the particle radiation emanating from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined exemplarily.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved an M-Class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the Sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
Esa is the first of three L missions in the Cosmic Vision program.
The spacecraft Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its voyage in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and aims to investigate the planet’s atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europa, Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Space offers many ways to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory under which all the known laws of nature can be united.
How was the universe created and what is it made of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter common to us, consisting of stars, planets, and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxy clusters, and dark energy, through whose action the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first few seconds of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", Esa has already approved an M-Mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
Using a special telescope, the probe is designed to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe over the entire sky for the first time, allowing conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
The best chances of getting a permit as an L-mission, according to many experts, has "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
This includes changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission includes a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
Unlike systems on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that emerged during the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is meant to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", the Earth-like planet.
Proposals for sample transport back from Mars, for exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, and for solar physics have already been eliminated.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence service, has declared he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented by Ströbele to the media in Berlin on Friday, Ströbele wrote: “Although the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government continues to treat a deviant opinion as a breach of fidelity and tries to criminalize political expression with a penal threat, in which no defense is possible.”
To tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community could persuade the American government to drop the charge against him.
The indictment brought by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to make that possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained by claims that the NSA had listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that one should seize the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness, if possible, “without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Greens MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied during his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Ströbele said Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden speaks in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “safe” there.
Snowden said in his letter that he was facing a “serious and ongoing” campaign of persecution that had driven him out of his homeland.
However, he was touched by the worldwide response to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities to cooperate “when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved”.
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers are likely to keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier explained that you charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who only paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee aims to move travelers to take care of payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate that amount,” she explained.
In 2008, airlines began charging fees for the first and second checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore stuffed as much as possible in their hand luggage, which results in the luggage compartments above the seat being often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who would have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry one piece of luggage free of charge at the gate of Frontier, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O’Malley said Frontier’s website and check-in procedures would be changed so passengers would be informed of the fee before they arrived at the gate.
The new Frontier hand luggage charge will only come into effect in the summer, there is no precise date yet.
Passengers often complain about luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transportation of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking in enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most have so far left their fingers on fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first claimed fees for hand luggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airliner, followed.
The only other airline with such a charge is Hungarian Wizz Air, airline consultant Jay Sorensen said, following the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit hand luggage charge will bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate if passengers were faced with the company’s unusual hand luggage charge.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve experienced in my aviation career,” he said.
I expected to see gnashing teeth and handy discussions at the gate.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding was lubricated.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company said passengers who bought lemonade or juice were allowed to keep the whole can and refill coffee for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major company had moved in.
Frontier’s move to levy fees for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of via an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut again to 25 percent of the flight route.
For this reason, a flight with Frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third-party provider will only earn customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively for direct purchase on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity shrunk nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to control Frontier's finances as part of the company's sale.
Proverbs come from the Bible
Around 40 women attended this year’s last women’s breakfast in the Protestant church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the congregational house was "Sprowers from the Bible" and "Redemptions from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, gave a lecture on the biblical proverbs after breakfast.
“Proverbs contain life wisdom, regulations, or warnings,” she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding scriptures and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as: Wooden eye be watchful, like scales fall from eyes, an eye on someone whom the Lord gives in sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker had her listeners advised what proverb it was.
The church councilwoman Christel Dehner took up the phrases from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, make blue, cut something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges to the past".
At the end, a tombola was lost.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously outlined before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round was also mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unlearned tourism
At the Mecklenburg Lake Plate, they started a pilot project for the tourism industry.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unlearned in the industry are to be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New to this is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are varied: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA declares an “internal error” and not hackers are to blame for website crash
The shady National Security Agency said late Friday that an error had paralyzed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable tonight for a few hours because an internal error occurred during a planned update," the spy agency said in an emailed message.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and is still not available for some users.
A spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way compromised.”
Secret information is not at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cybertactic is relatively simple and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency, is now in the bright light of the public and is exposed to sharp criticism after the revelations made known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data released by the desillusioned Snowworkers and former NSA.
The growing controversy over the intelligence service sparked initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without a job dropped slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the share was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy managing director of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
Because so far many companies have reacted to attitudes.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We have hardly any specialists in crafts, healthcare and elderly care."
Due to seasonal seasons, job vacancies for staff in the hotel and restaurant industries have also been available since September.
The winter season begins in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Bombardier lost profit after drop in delivery and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday after being put under pressure by declining orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could be commercially used in September, according to the ambitious schedule.
So far, only three more launches have followed the test aircraft’s maiden flight one and a half months ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is proceeding as planned.
Results lagged behind forecasts and led to a price drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his valuation from “outperform” to “sector perform” in view of the stock’s limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"While weaker delivery figures were expected for aircraft as much as possible, we are clearly disappointed in the margin development in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries at 177 are moderate, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet airliner are true.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The company’s management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft has not stayed on the ground any longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that during the aircraft's service life, ground tests and software updates had been scheduled.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, which we also did.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the next few weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical about whether twelve months after the maiden flight the first customer can take a CSeries aircraft into operation.
Bombardier said it will review the commissioning planning (EIS) and update it in the coming months.
“The slow progression of the flight test – although obviously in line with Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share of $172 million or 9 cents per share the year before.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
Revenue declined slightly and fell from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order inventory in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on 30 September, unchanged from 31 December.
“In the aerospace sector, the results were within our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that revenue in this division has increased by just under 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The inventory of orders in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on 30 September, slightly higher than on 31 December.
The margin of profit in the transport sector was affected by resolution problems in some large contracts.
According to company management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share declined 8.5 percent to $4.83 after it was also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would move to the Board of Directors.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.

Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, shared information with underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction could be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld magnate Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his investigation into drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash", was detained in his home in 2011 after police supervised Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after police secured 1.5 million pounds of heroin and cocaine and 200,000 pounds of cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, shared information with the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two counts of impediment of justice.
He admitted possession of cocaine in a previous interview.
The lawyer was convicted after police found out in their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigative officers followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta’s house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer’s trash can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it became known that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests found class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said he had spoken with the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that their discussion was subject to “lawyer secrecy.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
At the police interrogation, he stated that he operates an office both under his private address and at work and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it became known that he had called key players in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed investigators about what he knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “A criminal prosecutor should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of misuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the advocate of these persons.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered police investigations as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus discredited his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed all misconduct and claimed, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal the moment he started acquiring drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who commissioned him to gather valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has betrayed that trust and tries to hide behind the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation of Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for cocaine possession and impairment of justice, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can evade the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to trafficking heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta posted a question-and-answer section about himself, stating that his dream job as a lawyer was to represent clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and unequal opportunity was the motivation for his work.
The Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To conclude the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Dunningen Song Crown will frame two services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled viewers this spring, the song wreath will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German Fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26th, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19th during the Evening Mass in the St. Martinus Church in Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27th, from 10:15 at the service in the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Songs to celebrate the holy sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is performed as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass band of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Scepticism gives way to confidence
With the 2015 elections to the parish council, for example, fundamental changes will be made in the pastoral unit Haslach (SE).
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
The basic decisions of the diocese can no longer be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new is hesitating but increasingly confident.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the highly constructive discussions of the six committees with the main officials of the pastoral care team ranged.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
Afterwards, the SE Haslach as a parish will form a public law body that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual parishes so far.
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council in which the parish priest Kraft is represented.
At least two elected members shall be represented from each parish, and so-called community teams shall be formed in the six parishes.
In the future, your task will be to promote church life in the locality.
The question of the finances of the individual parish community then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations stipulate that accumulated funds in the parishes will be preserved in a dedicated manner.
The liabilities, on the other hand, go to the community as a whole.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which then meets all parishes, there were great concerns.
"In the past, too, only projects were invested that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," relativized Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint board for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the Schutterwald-Neuried pastoral unit.
In 2006, they had set out to “become one, stay five” and had to find that it wasn’t that easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher Pastoral Unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be concretised in further meetings and decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is becoming more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year for a family of four in Pfullendorf.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5,277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
In October each year, the four operators of the large power lines re-impose this levy.
These estimate the additional costs incurred by them as a result of the energy transition, which they can levy above the electricity price.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf forms the last link in this chain.
The energy company’s supervisory board had even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
“We assume a 1 cent plus x increase,” Bias says, with the number more likely to be close to 2 cents.
Lights on permanent red: pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What do you do when you are red?
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue to drive, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to persevere for at least five minutes before expecting a malfunction of the traffic lights.
Anyone who continues the journey despite red lights, however, must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped on green a little later.
A driving ban was spared because of the special situation - but the fine did not.
City Council is pleased with a solid budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal säck in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration no longer knows debts since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be booked as a full success.
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 financial statements.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was more than one million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around one million euro above the approach with about 1.8 million euros.
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the community share of income tax.
The asset budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned €1.5 million, it amounted to €2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher inflow from the administrative budget," Rothmund said.
As fewer investments than planned were made in the financial year 2012, the inflow of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You can't just shake a work like this out of your sleeves," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the council were clearly pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good numbers that could soon cost citizens a lot.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has in the past been able to forego high lifting rates.
However, according to Gerster, subsidies have been cut more often by the country.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various compensatory stations.
Among other things, cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain raise rates.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting, as investments are pending in the coming years, for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
At 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the Cäcilia men’s singing club is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, during which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his men’s singing club.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir, which is now more than well-loved.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and loyalty to the association he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers handed him the certificate of the German Choir Association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival took place in usual ways: with the MGV Betra, the song wreath Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmariners had loaded a colorful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Fustig, ihr Brüder".
They prepared for their honorary singer Hubert Wermter a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you go through the valley".
The song wreath Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "impuls schoor" - ensured the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the "impulsor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned with "Was ist der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" to the home countryside, where the Vollmariner Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Grandma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children were busy during the lunchtime.
Children's dreams come true
These days the kindergartens and daycare centers in the Zollernalbkreis receive post.
The Schwarzwald Bote, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and beautification requests.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, daycare centres and nurseries from all over the Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or embellishment desire for your decor, you can apply with this to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury composed of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb will select three wishes from all submissions.
What are the prerequisites for participation?
The wish should be realized with building materials worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide for many diligent construction helpers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and one can ask: what is it that prevents Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” read the newspaper, which considers the bill to be unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punishing and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new law “effectively puts the media in a throat” by the government, while The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered “a severe blow” and called the draft “draconic”.
The passing of the law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate mall in September.
The Kenyan media drew the anger of the authorities for publishing footage of security cameras showing how the units dispatched at the scene allegedly robbed the luxurious mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by recruiting two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even though the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possessions of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on what it describes as Kenya’s “living blogosphere.”
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation, who calls the Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
“Leaving politicians to themselves, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the time of the hunters and collectors,” he said.
The Kenyan legislators have already raised public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reinstated their decisive salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for the FC
Despite the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose anything about the importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone wished for a more pleasant hour of celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to participate.
So all those who came without an umbrella or couldn’t hold one for any reason had the look.
This happened to the musicians who framed the festivities, as did many speakers.
Wets therefore became FC Chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were first and foremost given to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was heavily involved in the implementation of the project, the Municipal Council, the companies involved and the members of the association who participated.
Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The busy retirees laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also commended by Member of the Landtag Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given to the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the Southern Baden football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation to the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn pitch in such a way that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, the first thoughts on how to solve the problem were given, when the construction of a third place at the venue of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee was thought of.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about setting up an artificial turf sports ground, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were initiated two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, pledged a cost share of 100,000 euros for the construction of the square and approved the country's funding of 104,000 euros.
In October 2012, the Municipal Council decided to take over the remaining 356,000 euros in the total cost of 560,000 euros, Klumpp summarized.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meters large artificial grass field began on June 4.
During the more than three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic meters of soil were removed, half of which was used to lay a dirt bike track.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of Home Affairs and Justice.
In addition, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, deputy suffrage and the federal police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, it should be about the issue of dual citizenship, in which both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its no toll on cars demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat for the multipurpose and thus ecologically counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator on the subject of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of evasion on roads that are already major accident areas.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be, from Pronold’s point of view, only a first step.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be removed at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing hair dryer wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When is it really summer?" was not the question on Friday evening on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was a tropical night in Stuttgart.

Driver seriously injured in accident
A 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday evening.
According to police, a 41-year-old woman from Müsch was driving her car on the Kempen outer ring towards Grefrath at around 9:15 p.m.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the 37-year-old’s coming car.
The driving tooth collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: locking after accident on the schanzlekreisel
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left turning lane towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer.
The 19-year-old VW Passat behind the BMW was also damaged.
A total of about 15,000 property damages occurred, the police said.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Proclamations like this will no longer be made at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker message thus falls away - the noise level should be reduced significantly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend by setting up messages that affect individual people.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already refraining from the noisy calls.
With the elimination of these messages - about 200 personal calls by the speakers sound on average in one day - it is expected to be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual messages were perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight departures or departure times are a bit lost here," Kleemann told the radio station.
Highlander Games at the Cold Farm
In addition to the brake trolley pulling with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swabish in the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't matter to the extent," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be dropped vertically, should once overlap and then just come to lie down.
This is evaluated with most points.
When throwing horseshoes, it depends on the target accuracy.
From a distance of eight meters is thrown on a pin.
The participants must demonstrate skill and strength when carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and quantity of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two can then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and single competition will receive prizes.
You can train from 10 a.m.
Matching clothing is desirable, for example, the competitors can compete in a Scots skirt.
But Swabian costume is also allowed.
For the "outfit", the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is plenty of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the music lovers come to their expense.
At 7 p.m., the Birabohmian blass music from Schömberg will organize the great evening of entertainment.
The chapel plays fleeting polkas and marches.
Their repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big-band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron, will be there for a while under the gutters.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the foolishness.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains the early bar, from 2 pm the Bauernkapelle Boffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then finish the festival.
The Stoppelacker party with DJ Ralf will kick off on Friday.
Other programme points on Saturday and Sunday include the Oldtimer- und Schleppertreffen, exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the maize labyrinth, the craftsman's market and the sheep shear.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw hop castle, tractor riding (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the multi-purpose club, the ski club and the tractor-friends "Zündkappenele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream is, for example, a quartz substitute.
The Vegetarian Federation also marks World Vegan Day on November 1.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on November 1, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt can be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Spotable plant cream replaces conventional whipping cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
A half crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple cider or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loose dough instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can also serve this purpose.
According to Vebu, around 800,000 people are currently eating vegan food in Germany, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, Black Forest High School students got to know the American city of New York.
After an eight-hour flight, we drove to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here already offered a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special charm in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but faithful to the motto "The city is not sleeping" the day was decided on Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty was reached by ferry on the second day and could be climbed on foot.
Then we went through the Wall Street financial center to the 9/11 memorial.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373-metre-high Empire State Building observation deck while enjoying the view.
Afterwards, we went through the hectic New York streets through the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to spend a short time in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and are experiencing school everyday at Weymouth High School.
This year too, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated on the day of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was said to be a rather ruthless hunter, who was converted by a vision and was later appointed bishop of Liège.
The Hunting Horn Blower Group of the Hunting Three Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth performs on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood of it) after ancient, originally French melodies.
The winds wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogs on tow hunts musically.
The solemn fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 a.m.
The redesigned opposition shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One who wants to make the name the program.
According to the dictionary, Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight of the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to remain the pure Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu feeling.
After all, the café with its beautiful name has exactly that objective: to make an actual stay not only thoughtful, but hand-held, recurring.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top pampers the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually decorated fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, already made a name for themselves before the opening of the ornate café at the Opschlag: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the opposition, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audience.
Not least through the university.
"We do not have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here want to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee treat.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew itself in the most varied variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more of an espresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright café.
Better to say one.
Because the harbour festival took place rather outside - the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the night of ringing.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds said.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a fan of event evenings because of this: "You can't make it right for everyone".
And with an event I always only talk to those who are interested in the special event.
This is why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to interfere with normal operation as little as possible."
Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the opposition in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many clivers, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu for themselves.

A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club hall of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious cooperation entirely in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the right festivity to celebrate honors.
This time writer Rolf Wagener was pleased with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"Not only did you write a lot for us, but you also shot so many rounds for us, our heartfelt thanks for that," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went this year to choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
5th place notary Artur Brückner.
A special thank you was addressed to the team of association economist Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again enchanted a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals always on Tuesdays at 7.45 p.m. in the club's venue.
"New voices are always welcome," Schlotmann said.
UN announces new targets in poverty reduction
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new targets to replace the 12-year-old Millennium Development Goals on Poverty Reduction.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Development Goals.
They have been included in the final draft of the document to be adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that the member states have agreed to undertake a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These targets will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realize our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, there is still a good mood among the handball superligists.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubts about this.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
I hope we finally win again.
"Because I don't even know how a win tastes like this," Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet cleared any trees, Malmon is warning in advance.
I have trained a lot of players myself in the A-Youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be very motivated against their ex-coach.
"We also have to wait to see if there is any reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to previous appearances.
Above all in the covering work and in the switching game, it was last but tremendous.
The exploitation of opportunities must also definitely be improved.
Therefore, I hope that my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to call for peace during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a t-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the independence square of the capital.
For the past two weeks, there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo almost daily, which are among the worst fighting since the peace accord more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by White-ruled Rhodesia and later by South Africa’s apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to fall back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have disturbed foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investments of more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the U.S. into the country over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on October 17.
The assaults on former rebels escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamos’ spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a “loser” who “will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid a war.
But concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
“Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously,” Mazanga said.
Earlier talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions sparked by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are knocking their heads together,” says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for election reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a sickening movement to obtain concessions and financial advantages from the government.
Renamos' election successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Mo<0xC3><0xA7>ambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza, whose resignation is due if his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made uneasy attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but is located in Beira, the port that mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga replied reluctantly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people have already been worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said the people simply wanted stability.
“No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks", and the Arthur legend demonstrates the importance of having a dream.
However, many of the myths are “by far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland called for a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who were “excessively didactic,” children would be “completely turned off” because in entertaining stories, the messages would be conveyed “subliminally”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally represented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were delighted by the extremely entertaining scene play.
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship until his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained contexts and bridged leaps of time from youth to near-retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob came home to his children's heaven, to his free-field.
And then began the scene play, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade as the great son of the city.
Stilecht he drove with the two-spinner and "Schwarzwalder Fuchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only greeted by the audience with much applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put himself into the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus completed the performance.
For the bestowal of honorary citizenship, Haslach’s mayor, Heinz Winkler, gave himself the honor, who, in the representation of the then incumbent Hättich, together with a part of the city council, made his attendance.
Their expectation then made the three-king singers, who prompted Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh how beautiful, there are again youth memories of my own three-king period come alive".
With their song "O Jesulein", they delighted the audience in the courtyard as well as the stork day children with their loud "O Jesuslein".
His criticism of the official church at the time had expressed the same as his concerns about the growth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
“A restless spirit had finally found its calm and had gone home forever,” the scene ended.
There was a lot of applause and a lot of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Giant is growing
The chances of remaining in the league of the sportingly descended Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar Giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project refuses to apply for a possible place to move forward.
“We will not participate in the wildcard process,” said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
However, there was no initial breathing from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure as long as it is not clear that Düsseldorf will not receive a license," Alexander Reil, Neckar's giant boss, told our newspaper.
Until May 23, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic suitability for the Bundesliga.
To date, the Rhinelanders have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Supper Church comes to the fore
As the city’s contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s Cultural and Tourism Office dedicates the last of its public theme tours this year on Sunday, October 27, to the Supper Church.
After visiting the Atomic Cellar Museum, the Haigerloch period is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning end is a visit to the Supper Church.
There, the leaders are told the history of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant church in a whole Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also has a view of the supper painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the other half-hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomic Cellar Museum.
Tickets are available at the cash register of the Atomic Cellar Museum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. spy affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by Interfax, citing not-specific circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally, it said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency said.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens extradition there, it said.
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams fought for the winning title at the clubs' tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had been given to the tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games on the plan per team, each playing against each other.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
Favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were on the same spot with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the winning ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the target straight.
Second place was double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team reached the bronze staircase.
In the late afternoon sunshine and coffee and cake, the tournament ended successfully.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwald Open-Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday programme for a colorful children's and family festival with numerous co-working events and events.
"Great and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release said.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, the right thing for any age is there.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop also works.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or centrifuges, the young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
Have fun too, the many old games, such as wheelbarrow races or stilts running.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, each at 12 and 2 pm.
On a railing tour, the children must guess which stories correspond to the truth or are lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with black forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward to the clown Otsch on Sunday, who drives his scabbard from 11am with the museum guests.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner is cosy and fairy tale-like.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 3 pm.
In addition, the children’s costume dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event, from 11 am to 5 pm, numerous craftsmen such as the broom binder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can look over their shoulders during their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum await a varied holiday programme.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a lovely chew because he set out to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt is not discouraged from his dream despite a heart defect.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he ships to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the haul.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal import, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind turbine logistics, among other things.
Black shimmers the charcoal in the warehouse in front of the dike.
Two huge blue dumpsters and rechargers distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With every movement of the envelopes, a loud warning sound sounds over the terrain.
“The signals are for safety purposes and are legally required,” says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, with unfavorable winds, this can be heard widely - and so there were already some complaints from people from the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to focus on open dialogue with his neighbours.
Matthias Schrell has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5-metre deep tub in front of the terminal, Capesize bullcarriers can also be handled here.
"This year we want to break the 3 million tonne mark in the envelope," Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the imported coal goes to power plants in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant goes into the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could generate up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first loss in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can prevent us from winning even against the best team in Europe of the past two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at Olympiakos' championship defender Piraeus.
We have sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
On their third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to turn a 15-point gap into a lead 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus again gave the game a turn.
"We fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made light-headed mistakes," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the Munich’s most successful throwers, who celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Nearly a hundred years ago, the varietal artist Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has been expanded, as has been the case at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up institution, this year’s festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they eventually became too familiar to perform in a club,” Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy benefit event for veterans at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians attending this year’s festival have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as shows on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironically slippery fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival’s biggest visitor magnets is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has evolved into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show titled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me when he's here, then he sometimes walks through the alleyway between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
Iran Satisfied with Nuclear Negotiations
One week before the next nuclear meeting, Iran is pleased with the five UN veto powers and Germany is pleased with the negotiation process.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will eventually come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Gamers with Machete
Two children in Uruguay have admitted the murder of an 11-year-old man.
The two 14- and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go on bird hunt with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
Afterwards, they played football in front of their homes in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger she had taken with her was supposed to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the gang in front of the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder mentioned, among other things, a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Pimps have to go to prison
Due to exploitative human trafficking, cocaine, threat, insult and dangerous bodily harm, the Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession in the context of a trial agreement.
According to the report, in five cases he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent against their will after a few weeks.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women, who for many years had been acquiring for him.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he suppressed women’s contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their revenues.
In court, the defendant first claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert suggested great doubts about mental impairment and thus a limited ability to blame, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any of the injured women.
According to a Kripo official, at least four more cases of human trafficking could be detected after a first announcement by telephone surveillance measures.
The interviews were marked by high levels of aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had spotted blemishes all over her body, has not yet made any statement.
It is a “completely broken personality” that considers violence and exploitation in this field normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has separated himself from these circles and wants to live a normal life after arrest," he said.
Oil price continues down to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns over a high supply overshadowed a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil grade for December deliveries fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in the late morning e-commerce trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange in Europe.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a 5.8 percent price drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that the U.S. supply had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was evidence of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, whose growth rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude oil used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on NYPD’s stop-and-fresh policy
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who had called for changes to the New York Police Department’s Stop-and-Frisk program, removing the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal ruled that Judge Shira Scheindlin’s decisions would be suspended until an appeal was decided by the city.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the manner in which the program for the arrest and inquiry of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedial measures ordered, including the decision to set up a surveillance body to assist the police in amending its policy and training program.
The Court of Appeal heard Tuesday the arguments for the requested suspension.
The Appeal Report stated that the judge must be released from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of bias, partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court’s criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted unreasonably targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-fresh program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy reforms, training and service oversight, and ordered a pilot program of body-carried cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released after a police check.
An oral hearing to appeal the city is scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-fresh tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the term of the nonpartisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, filed a lawsuit, which developed into a group lawsuit.
Advocates of changes to the NYPD’s stop-and-fresh program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force as well as affect the way other police officers use the regulation.
Opponents are of the view that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; nor would it waste money and fail to solve the broader problem of a police force under pressure after thousands of jobs were dropped over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-fresh practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD implemented the controls.
The happiness of dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helpful Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth anniversary of the association was celebrated, which can already show considerable success.
The first chairman Henne reported extensively on the work of the association.
He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous surgeries on site on several trips.
During the speeches, images of the stakes were shown on a large canvas, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the club was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to act in an advisory function at the association.
In 2008, the carpentry Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the infirmary in Socogim, a miserable district on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of just under a week - voluntary.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, according to Henne, for example, slowing down against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but for this, many medical doctors came to Germany to hospitalize here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical equipment, medicines, dressing materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided abundant local colours by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to a mobile goat’s stable and by describing the experiences of the musicians from Stammheim, who traditionally support the association, during their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motives, he referred to his work in the field of auditing as a young MP.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also demands global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It is not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had an affair with his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and pursued them, but Coulson also called them and left messages, as the court learned.
“In the opinion of the prosecutor’s office, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not one who stands in front of people’s homes and hopes to catch them in a fresh act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, surveillance, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors of Clarke's affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editorial staff when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
Investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
During the time the research ran, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story we want to release tomorrow that I would like to talk about with Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
Jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had been confronted with an affair with a married woman when he himself was in a relationship with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks disputed that they had conspired to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned wealth tax, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France maneuvered into a dead end after a failed arbitration meeting.
President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande received representatives of associations and associations at the Paris <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace on Thursday and also heard their complaints.
But he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014 onwards.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, said the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The matches in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between November 29 and December 2.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to raise ideas.
Häußler clarified: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipality council."
The flood, which hit Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009, was a significant event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler said.
A river area survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built-up plots as possible is the goal," Häußler said.
According to the German Weather Service, the basis is the planning of protection against floods that can be expected statistically every 100 years.
Climate change is reflected by a 15% surcharge.
In specialist circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in 2009 in Gechingen corresponded to a 1,000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," Häußler said.
In order to achieve HQ 100aKlima protection, around four million euros have to be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can expect state subsidies of around 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out, however, that there is only funding if an overall concept is implemented.
The community is dependent on the participation of its citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case scenario, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipality council (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the Irm river from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it requires the interplay of all the presented measures to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, it is important to find the most economical solution, says Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
There was displeasure in the neighbourhoods of the Altort, which, even in normal thunderstorms, have to suffer repeatedly from an overload of the channel network.
The problem is known in the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the directives for sewer systems are different than for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that two to three-year rainfall events can be handled.
Bigger dimensioning of the sewage ducts would devour millions.
Injured after collision
Early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on the Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could at first say little about the accident.
However, there are several testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf was driving towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so heavily jammed that it took the fire brigade nearly half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Both of the casualties came to nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostoyevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Surprisingly, the relationship in the exterior: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And so, as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, is to be understood, Philip K. Dick is to be read as an American prophet, who is quite true in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives distributes Two Thousand Ones.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, paired with paranoia, security madness, and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of John’s revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He understood early on that the calculators are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
It is here that the principle of “pre-crime” is developed, “pre-crime”, which is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which looks terrifyingly like ours, mutants look into the future - and the police are approaching.
“We are catching individuals who have not violated any law,” said the head of the agency.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a penal camp full of heavy criminals." You read flows of time.
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into action.
Dick's narrative acts like the blueprint for the NSA's anti-terrorism laws and the NSA's listening rush.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of power, the military controls everyday life - and what remains of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system's up.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only does it accept mistakes and sacrifices, it builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Spionage affair about Merkel in Russia testifies
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum case in the US spying affair with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German federal prosecutor’s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Earlier, Greens MP Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA Reveals Increase Company Paranoia Over State Surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany’s financial capital.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German internal intelligence service, he should photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a discussion between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. did not use foreign espionage “to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit.”
But since Edward Snowden, a former whistleblower, began releasing his filling horn to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can take the director to the floor.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquiring data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia to a new height over state surveillance.
The barrel overflowing led to the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been missing, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management is certainly also a potential target.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany has to wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now posed almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in the documents leaked by Snowden, there has so far been no evidence that the US has passed on the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical of this.
In the Bundestag, it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn’t have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the range and technical sophistication of the U.S. spy agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations has shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest espionage risk in China.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing because European business leaders are now becoming more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and therefore potentially endangered.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, about ten percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider after revelations about US data mining activities with Prism.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, said: “We’re seeing a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago: where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in this jurisdiction?”
Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed by the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate management usually does not boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because that gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been persuaded that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the board of Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BAT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in the respective niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access,” the BAT warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia and Israel ranked two of the countries behind China that used to obtain economic data from hacking.
A member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Homeland Security Service (CDRL), was quoted in an interview this month as saying, “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Fair gives answers to wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake,” said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding ceremony succeeded, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
There were important suppliers around a wedding.
One trend: the retro look is coming back.
It starts with wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
The dresses are closed in the front, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end up in a sledge.
However, the ghosts separate, as Stefanie Koch stresses from the fashion house Kleidermüller.
In men, the suit with vest and plastron dominates, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
It was important to choose the location, he said.
Jewelry-free adjoining rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here, the domain drew attention to its own offer in the discount.
If you want to go ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"Slides are also popular for boyfriends," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" - shooting series in special places, preferably for example waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding board, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successful
For the repeated time, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it to place twelve with 87 points.
Susi Höpp faced the judge’s critical eyes with her Woody in class 1.
Parents of Georgia teenager who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up ringing mat in his high school gym, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on Jan. 11 in an upright mat behind the stand in the school hall.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's investigative officers concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubted.
“They are convinced their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson’s lawyer, told FoxNews.com.
They would never have thought he died as the sheriff concluded.
“They believe that it is without logic, that it violates the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Her son went to school to study and came back in his body bag,” he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death as a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was stated by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggested Johnson died as a result of “position-related suffocation.”
A second autopsy revealed another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he would commission the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's office was not immediately prepared to comment on our request Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos that investigators have checked.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video recordings contained clues to how he died.
CDC Releases Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines the U.S. government has issued as the number of schoolchildren with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the faculty and staff and how to deal with children who have allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – EpiPen brand auto-injection is most commonly used – to cope with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently amended regulations to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair on it,” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Parents of intersex children can choose ‘gender indefinitely’
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third sex for children born with unclear genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly to either male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can indicate "indeterminate" or "not fixed" on the birth certificate.
The purpose of the law is to take pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding surgeries for sex assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, according to the BBC, "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year is born neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to intersexuals, a group that is diagnosed with “Sexual Differentiation Disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovasculars or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend using the best available information on gender allocation if a determination is not possible and not waiting for the child’s psychological and physical development before deciding on surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said the new German law “knocks for a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity at all is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match the gender image now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, in Australia and Nepal, it is possible for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or “third sex”.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person after a court granted the maintenance of a "undefined" sex status for life.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment in the future, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from school books.
Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, saying: “If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision but sexual activity is not, then we will twist two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone she would find it better if babies were assigned a sex at birth.
“Parenthood is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told the parent’s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine looked at sex as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But now, the ethical foundations of surgery are being questioned, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors may also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex they have assigned.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
If such a child was born, then they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of treating children with unclear genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was formable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental impulses – such as parenting a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, and influenced whether a person considered himself male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off during a pussed circumcision to completely castrate the child and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sexual surgeries came to the public, who are "not happy with the result".
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were unclear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should have a vaginal plaster.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
Due to the operation, he became infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called the Interface Project to make intersex people perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law can “encourage stamping and stigmatizing.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child an ‘unsettled’ one,” she explained.
We are afraid that this favors interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she explained.
German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a struggle to force small children to at this time.
When you grow up, you can decide your own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law “authorizes” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptive effect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an assistant in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“The law gives parents room, so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things, giving them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness.
And you don’t have to hurry to perform an operation that can no longer be reversed.
“This involves children in the decision making and eliminates the fear that parents are driving away because they think they are not doing the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides the sex that best suits him – and that’s wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown girl hurt by gunshot from car
Unknown people shot a 12-year-old girl in Saxony-Anhalt from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children with an air pressure gun on Thursday evening in Genthin.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on her left calf.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The police investigated, it was said on Friday.
Until now, the Kempten Police Inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officers were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades.
Since the house owners recognized this in time and removed the remains of the eggs immediately, no damage to property was likely to have occurred either.
In addition, some Sylvester Böllers were probably set on fire in the city area, but no damage to property has occurred here either.
A local resident on the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel blinds were stolen.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his cycling screens all in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue to act.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives fantastically.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"Hopefully you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for me and my husband for a while now.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the worry of being unable to cope with the many steps to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifty-year-old has had to learn on her own, what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.
Recently, a book by her has been published on the topic of 'Happy Living in Age - Which form of living is the best for me?'.
“Our apartment is the best example of what doesn’t work in old age,” she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Today, in the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most of them displace it as long as they can.
“Only the others are getting old,” she smiles.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really high do you think.
"But then it may be too late," Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
“Whatever form of living you choose is always an individual decision,” she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford to retire in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they could also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the local language, you can also be isolated in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author gives resettlement readers to bear in mind.
Among their models are classical care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited pensioner-WG.
In old age, everyone has his ticks and chips
“For me it would be like a living room, but nothing,” she said with a wink.
Not at all like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"At old age, you just need your retreat rooms," Ries said.
The fact that a senior living community can still function does not exclude the author.
But this must be different than in the classical student-WG.
And sometimes you just want his peace of mind,” she believes.
With this opinion she is not alone in the state capital at least.
"Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible", is the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the Citizens' Service Life in the age of the state capital.
Their department advises people on the topic of 'becoming older'.
That’s why even older people would often accept inconveniences and limitations just to be able to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that everyone who is concerned with age-appropriate remodeling of their house or apartment get thorough information and not hire the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat elevation, the interior designer clarifies.
But it is not always possible to remodel the existing apartment according to age and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to do this experience.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the also paved path to the apartment door would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she fears more than before the spider at her door.
U.S. wants to prosecute Snowden
The United States has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He is also accused of illicitly divulging secret information.
Therefore, he must face a criminal case in the United States, said Jennifer Psaki, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, in Washington.
Nor would Snowden’s recent statements change that.
Previously, the German Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to threaten him with further punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele’s remarks were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German government member.
Secret service secretary Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This was clarified by the former NSA employee sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the federal government, the Bundestag and the federal attorney general.
The letter, according to a translation distributed by Ströbele, reads as follows:
To the responsible
I was asked to write to you regarding your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to be a contractual or direct technical expert with the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government, which prompted me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was faced with a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations drew up many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the formerly covert abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear, while the risks assumed have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of fidelity and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this detrimental attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in an appropriate and legal manner.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared up and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Nursery found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in Gartenstraße has been sold by the municipality to a private individual.
The Municipal Council agreed to the sale at its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier said.
The budget was set aside for 100,000 euros.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen gave responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, such as heating, looking for the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
“This effort is now gone,” Maier rejoices.
Concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammerreisenbach gives a concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clockstick at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
President Manuela Honeck explains the music.
Honeck thanked everyone who had helped manage the first musician shock successfully.
Report: Obama Campaign Considered Replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most noteworthy surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times has a copy of the upcoming book and she reported Thursday evening that the president’s top advisers had conducted “large group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out if Obama’s dwindling hope of re-election would look better if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times’ national policy correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of campaign leaders and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the survey values that former Secretary of State Clinton exchanged for the Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, Obama’s former campaign leader Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew about the proposed change.
“Double Down” alleges that Daley stood at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her “close, personal relationship” before finally deciding against such a move after the data showed that Clinton’s candidacy “would not significantly improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said a whole bunch of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
One has to remember that the president had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what are we doing?”
While Daley described the investigations as “provided diligence,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out if such a move paid off in terms of the ballot boxes.
“Campaigns don’t spend as much money on surveys and focus groups if you don’t think seriously about something,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley said he did not believe the president was “conscious” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political polls had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama knew nothing about the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the election.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
What happens on the way with my email?
E-mail is an electronic letter.
Was e-mail technically implemented in the design of the Internet service similar to that of the traditional postal service?
When designing early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not provide a stable basis for a sound exchange of letters.
Therefore, a traditional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the two computers directly connected?
The e-mail program or browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will traditional emails be read on their way through the web?
Most emails are read on the road by software robots several times.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail has a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam email that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also finds the information Google needs to place contextual advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people read the emails?
The likelihood that unauthorized persons will read an email is extremely low.
But theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal means of intercepting or noticing emails.
In addition, there are possible illegal espionage actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from read-only?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against read-on.
With great technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an email communication, so that it is not even readily possible to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany?
According to an August 2013 investigation by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mailboxes that are mainly used privately.
While Yahoo Mail’s shares had fallen most recently, Google’s GMail was able to grow significantly.
Mother hides in the forest and collects pension
When his aged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and nursing allowances.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations.
At first he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he cut the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time it was noticed that the mother in need of care was no longer needed medication.
The retiree told investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because the officers felt this strange, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an obduction revealed no evidence of a capital crime.
Want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice cream shining in the dark using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous treat.
The idea came to him after reading a research paper on jellyfish and persuading Chinese scientists to artificially make the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, which raises the pH in the protein and triggers the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and lights up – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We’ve tested it over the past few months and it seemed ideal to launch it on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and leafy gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, “I want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is in and of itself impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we find a way to make it happen.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially made by Chinese scientists
After six days, TSV Morsum is still without any points in the Handball Association League.
Especially now it comes for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to the derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated last weekend his first victory.
With this game, the season starts new for us.
"I hope we finally have our heads free," Ehlers said optimistically.
He finally has his entire squad at his disposal, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Daverden also relies on pace play as we do.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
However, it is first and foremost necessary to increase the coverage, which has left anything but a certain impression lately.
Daverden’s coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was a house number.
But that’s why we’re still not the favorite, because everything can always happen in the derby.
However, Panitz now wants to recede in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this, the A-Youth Joost Windßuss, who is active with double play law at the A-Youth Bundesliga HC Bremen, is celebrating his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I became more of a Halloween muffin.
For the last two years I have not agreed to distribute candy from my apartment, and I probably won’t do it this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Retail Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, arousing inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wear sexy clothes, they can now embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft punk spacemen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and were not alone to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on their pets’ costumes, according to the NRF.
It’s a lot of hot dogs.
As far as candy is concerned, we are not comical.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candy and rubber bears.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce 41 million people who walk through the neighborhoods with the phrase “sweet or sour”.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not imagine – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is sugar-sweet candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are being sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectionery Manufacturers Association.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I have not yet solved.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it's spooking.
They have great names like “Terror Behind the Walls” (which stands in a real prison by the way), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized homes in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos you pee in your pants and then put your friends on Facebook where you won’t get rid of them again, and then the guy you’re standing on leaves a comment like “nice facial expression.”
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from an early age.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up with carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Home Fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue workers bury charred body
The fire brigade had to depart in Helmbrechts late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire at night to Friday.
The rescuers picked up a charred body from the house.
Rescuers found a charred body in a three-family home in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
It had burned on the ground floor of the house late Thursday evening.
When the firefighters arrived, the flames had already beaten out of a window.
The police went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
Background is a possible lack of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve according to the current situation by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in a conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine yourself.
With Burfien, the state church has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
Nowadays, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien traces this to the process of de-ecclesiastification: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could well live on it.
Surely more will be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This is true for today’s young people, who are not only concerned with careers, but also with meaningful work.
According to the state church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree begin their vicarage.
In thinly populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced braking, a service package with support from Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The rally customers coming to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an achievable way to world-class events.
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the strains and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it’s going to be an entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will feature a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called to rescue a dog who was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock promontory in a quarry
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her distressed situation.
Firefighters roped off the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to bring a puppy to safety that was stuck on a 15-metre-high projection in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who owned the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and posted calls for help on social networks when she had escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker who walked his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station’s technical rescue team rushed to the site and departed to rescue Ruby, which was then transported upwards in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move a muscle during her rescue – she was like a stiff frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate some dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual assignment.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge luck."
There was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “To watch the rescue was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was up there.
It was wonderful to hold her back in my arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the fatigue became too great and it collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had worked as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the altrocker, and that “he dug me up when I was 18.”
She added, “It’s been a long time ago and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denies that he has ever made any attempts at rapprochement with Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Maybe she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" immediately landed at No. 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European disintegration gives the Scots a choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time, we are being warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire-secured border along the Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic benefits that would bring about greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not matter – as expected – in the headlines.
Neither has anyone mentioned that EU member states often correct their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland does not currently belong to the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
Actually not a story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I heard the “independence means passport controls” duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany) party – founded this year – was able to garner almost five million votes in the Bundestag election in September and effectively drive the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Due to the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket, in which the respective national economy is forced by the adherence to the common currency, many people feel that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave it that way.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deepening European productivity problem.
As a result of the “green” energy directives enacted by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage fixes in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt arises, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which they could keep Germany in check and raise Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe’s own economic policy, which has to be fought by the afflicted French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-hostile Front National has just won a decisive by-election and thus referred the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically benefit the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is what I want to point out: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of being flattered by the US.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final consequence) small-England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including saying what Berlin and Brussels can do.
I suspect that Scotland could do quite well in a more relaxed European connexion, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only then to get a austerity policy imposed on Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty more than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean puberty.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming down parents – usually that’s not a sign that puberty is coming fast,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, shame and armpit hair, as well as body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (appearance of the first menstrual bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it will take at least two to three years to menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is true that breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth boost before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
If progressing faster, tests may be indicated by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and preventing another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is restrained as far as medication is concerned, but he admits: “Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls’ feelings of being different from their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They're worried about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her days when she was ten.
Even though there were early signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Boys get into puberty in the same way as girls.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the obesity epidemic.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study of girls aged six to nine, which establishes a link between body fat and adolescence.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty more than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys’ facial and puberty hair is growing earlier, the trend towards a full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“We need to be careful as we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz advised.
When you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who flourish early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers dispute over seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, which sets the tone for a bitter clash at this month’s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats offered to passengers on long tourist-class flights – not always the ones that airlines strive the most for, but this designated space is the key to efficiency claims on the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. archival Boeing says airlines should decide.
The fight comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
The design of the rear part of the aircraft – especially if there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results indicated by the new “mini-jumbo” design.
Boeing claims its modernized “777X” will accommodate 406 people in tourist class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing 10 per row.
Airbus says the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Airplane giants often share bumps about technical details through advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company unveiled an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, showing donors a picture of three people sitting in a restaurant squeezed together, and the title: “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turboprops,” said Airbus Chief Sales Officer John Leahy.
In the face of changing dietary habits, people are getting thicker, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American between 40 and 49 years of age increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average male American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a 1950s seating concept when the average body size of the newly named “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have shown that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus’ figures for seat dimensions and says it is not in the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines will shape the balance between airfares and facility.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to do to be successful,” said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it’s about more elbow clearance, but for manufacturers, it’s becoming increasingly a topic that can affect sales.
Behind the fight is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion by list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the fight over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results depend partly on the fact that the 777X, with its ten seats per row, is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than with currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into his aircraft to make it more competitive with our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777s suggested that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper airfares.
“Eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is driven by the threat from the 777,” said Mary Kirby, cabin facility expert, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry tape measure to measure the setup against the competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high compressed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to go down, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Break the Pleasure of Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More tests are needed before human testing, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We’re very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to quit trying all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information to make nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker not to experience nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal activity levels.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a "pause", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it turns liver cells into antibodies factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, smokers would use it to quit.
“They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure from the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to quit the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the findings were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labor Party Minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales is under investigation by the State Corruption Supervision.
The former NSW minister denies that he had amended the maritime leasing arrangements at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings in three lands on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without a tender after their expiration in August 2005.
Now the allegations are investigated that Tripodi knew of Obeid's covert interest in the plots after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole testified accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer runs.
In 2009, the leases for the companies at Circular Quay, which raised the Obeids $2.5 million annually, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who served as port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public tenders.
However, he rejects having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged a reform of the government’s lease arrangements.
A telephone caption submitted to ICAC showed August-September 2007 conversations between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
“Was the topic discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of commercial leasing arrangements?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers with a 457 visa could be subjected to ‘authenticity tests’
The government is considering an “authenticity test” for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used via a criterion that would prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for family and friends to move to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was released today after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments regarding foreign workers because they could be seen as insulting by Australia’s neighbors.
“Sounding statements like ‘foreigners should stand behind’ and ‘for Australians first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to hear an echo of this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The proposal outlines twelve measures that were once proposed by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who visited Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others still being considered.
If the 'echtness criterion' is adopted, a person applying for a visa could be checked to see whether 'the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking'.
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and the North of England as early as the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring Britain closer together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completing Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unambiguously" advocate for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail link holds the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland’s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK.”
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland that creates benefits for everyone and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with the British ministers next year and to agree on the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft will remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones on take-off and landing despite efforts in the US to ease regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in “flight mode”.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they take off and land.
Australian companies are observing the decision that U.S. airlines will have to do a lot of work to implement it, but they do not have any immediate plans to change their regulations.
CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
“Casa currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on the aircraft,” the statement said.
The subject matter is subject to provisions that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and that passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin personnel.
Virgin has already been in talks with CASA about expanding its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, stating that it is open to change, but that it needs to be initiated by the legislature.
“We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would stay with the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we are sure to take a closer look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision will have a different impact on U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases, with poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
Before the revierderby against Schalke, BVB-fans had traveled with lighting rockets for ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced severe consequences.
Before Friday's match of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - at first.
It was an unfamiliar, almost spooky acoustics that offered the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German Vice-Champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were listening to their songs.
The southern stand, on the other hand, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle calls.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint lighting, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the stand, a large flag with the inscription "Section Stadium Ban" was waving lonely.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, was the first BVB player to enter the field, a brief jubilation arose.
As his teammates followed, there was loud vocals and waving scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribune, nothing was stirred.
The fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again enumerated the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a mood for celebration.
Only five minutes before the whistle, the capo climbed his pedestal - and the tension that had hitherto been felt with his hands was released in a loud scream, when Dickel, as usual, asked about the mood on the slopes in the stadium.
Lastly, as always, it was the South Tribune's turn - and finally here was again as usual the noisiest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derbysieger stands up" came with a whistle from the southern tribune, everything was again as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired light rockets into the spectator's ranks and onto the square - and almost met goalkeepers Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was whistled late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB boss announced Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
“I forbade it,” he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy in terms of pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were shown different possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week.
“It’s going to be a big deal,” Watzke assured.
One can be curious about how the reactions on the southern tribune will be.
Pant houses boom in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn shop at the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay her daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, all my money is in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) each month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is on the rise – is so high that ValueMax, where it traded, this week became the third pant house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Pledging jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pledges in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over the 15.4 percent that United Overseas Bank demands, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops offer the advantage that there is no need to check creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are possible faster than banks.
That’s why millions of people in the region turn to pawnshops after families feel the pressure from rising costs of living and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose financial policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are looking for pawnshops to make up for the difference in the booming economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, described as a risk factor for Asian banks’ creditworthiness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which just came out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
“Ultimately, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have heightened the trend of pledging personal items as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city state’s 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say to themselves, "The gold price looks good, let's pledge Grandma's gold chain and get it back next month."
The largest Thai pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent customer growth in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the pledge business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company funded that with 60 percent of the $66 million it took this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have fallen on the brink of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own, and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household training," she explains.
The pledge lending business is increasingly accepted in society as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use bonds are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
We have clients from all walks of life.
“This includes wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses who need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence intelligence secretary Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany clarify the ever-breaking NSA spy affair.
According to Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Greens’ parliament, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence official would testify before a German prosecutor’s office or before an investigative committee.
Snowden has referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
325 million Australian dollars rescue package for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the over 325 million Australian dollars rescue package for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “immediate measures” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
Funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasman MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has tied up an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency electoral assistance.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic procedures and treatments for gray starvation, will eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-hospital care, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of an electronic health record system in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian healthcare system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that put the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a big contribution to removing the state’s public health system from the care list,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these elections will largely make up for recent cuts.
But the opposition’s health policy spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes today’s announcement is just a “paster solution”.
“We are in today’s situation because the state lab government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
It can’t be that a state government will pull nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth will put 300 million in it and then pretend to be the good news.
Dutton called for Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier than necessary.
Set in France in the 1760s, the plot tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of another’s erotic fascination.
The film never slips away into lust or sensation – and that’s its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a cruel penitent shirt for the audience.
Syria Has Destroyed Its Possibility to Produce Chemical Weapons, Surveillance Group Says
Syria has destroyed major chemical weapons and gaseous ammunition manufacturing facilities, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group said on Thursday, as there were serious clashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the
1 November, which the Hague-based organization had set up Damascus to destroy or "inoperable" all facilities for the production of chemical weapons, including all machines for mixing chemicals to poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin destroying the weapons and supplies available.
There are estimated to be about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say there is a production facility for chemical weapons and deposits, as reported by the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll via a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the part of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 are government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not give any details.
The fighting underscores the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, as their mission to free Syria from its poisonous arsenal of weapons is a race against time amid a raging civil war.
According to OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team “is now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and witnessed their destruction.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites designated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, it was not possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites had been abandoned, according to the Syrian statement, "and the chemical weapons program objects there had been relocated to other aforementioned facilities, which were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I take my hat on the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” Ahmed Uzumcu, the director-general of the surveillance organization, said in a commentary published by OPCW.
For the past three years, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad’s government and its security forces, many of which are members of the Alawites, a separation of Shiite Islam.
Regarding further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over sentencing of Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted disgusted at the verdict for the last of the instigators brought to justice, as they believed Umar Patek was to be executed in a legal manner.
Patek, who was on the run for nearly ten years as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted people, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder over the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A series of terrorism-related charges were also convicted, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had demanded a life sentence, even though it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who is dubbed "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb builder.
The decision has evoked painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago.
Struggling with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“He should be put in front of a shooting squad,” Corten told AAP.
I have to live with it every day that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was grounded when, shortly after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002, a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “died” three times while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Actually, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
To keep him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He evaded nearly a decade of arrest, but was eventually picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had hinted that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t come,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no regret for how much suffering he has done to other people.
The ruling came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is being commemorated in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on airplanes (but do not make phone calls)
From departure to landing, air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not make phone calls, according to the new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline, FAA staffer Michael Huerta told a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals as well as the regulations for storing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could very soon approve the expanded use of electronic devices," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not allowed to restart until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing approach, passengers must turn it off again and must not take off again before the plane has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even on take-off, landing and on the field, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional flight attendant association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” said Glading.
Honestly, we are tired of having to feel like a watchman on this issue.
Nevertheless, internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers remained prohibited, the agency explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to publicly leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at launch and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national traffic safety expert, told CBS News that mobile phones were still considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they could potentially cause disruptions to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitter masts,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, up to one-third of passengers forget or ignore the shutdown of the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air passengers in 1966, after reports of navigation and communication equipment failures by passenger-driven VHF radios became known, which at the time represented the latest technological trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they don’t care about electronic interference.
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for several years now when the flight height has been reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger planes should be suitable for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal radiation when you flip.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the advocates of easing restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and took a test flight to determine problems, but could not detect them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes the interference from the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports of pilots speaking for a failure of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the disconnection of the devices by passengers when instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable fit for travelers who would be extensively equipped with technology today.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued by North Sea drilling rig released again
An airborne rescue bird found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island has been released back into the wild.
The watershed was flown by a helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was buffered by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This watershed was probably a wintering migratory bird from northern Europe, stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: “He couldn’t fly any further, which is why we were contacted with a request for help.”
When they were released, the waterway was healthy and fit again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives representing around the UK’s corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing as states in the EU stagnate.
They want the government to promote new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead of halting the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked about certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, as the companies said the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with the one that is traditionally the most Europe-friendly.
Finally, and that’s probably most likely to say, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “meaningful change” that will bring the heft of action back to the UK.
There’s a lot to it – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favor of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the re-negotiation of the UK conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a re-negotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show, which means greater focus on trade for businesses and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller calls Bulgarian pipeline the start of a new gas era
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the Gazprom board said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to provide more diversity on Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia’s gas is stored for Europe, raises the risk of conventional routes, as officially reported.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “forever” shut down.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other suburban countries is expected to begin on the planned route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location Germany.
The economic framework data are correct, and the financing possibilities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out this on the 9th day of the Stock Exchange Newspaper.
How sought-after German commercial properties are, the look at the transaction volume shows, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the prior-year period.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, while in France it was 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate," Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with child sex offences before charges were made against Caringbah child care provider Jonathan Lord in 2011, according to the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
Yet in the opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said that “the organization has never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse.”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about one case in which an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another in which a sports instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 of the abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, an assistant lawyer at the Commission, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there were external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognized as a frontline in child safety."
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, admitted that management had failed “from me downwards” in hiring Lord and failed to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord was convicted earlier this year of sexual offences against twelve boys during his two-year work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denies, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations regarding the safety of children.
Staff said they watched violations, including that Lord was alone with children, privately cared for them as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior lord was and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior lords at the YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and very inaccessible most of the time.”
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements by employees that they did not dare to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had rather impaired their judgment, which is why they had not reported to him.
Hare explained that he had informed the YMCA NSW board of directors of his view that the lesson the organization had to draw from the “Jonathan Lord incident” was “not reporting” by employees, and the board had agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations appeared had been made by the YMCA’s Child Services Managing Director, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, which had been "overeager" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in the recruitment, review, recruitment, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admitted that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and mostly limited his comments to foreign policy and his role as an envoy to the Middle East Peacemakers Quartet.
Asked if he would like to return to the prime minister’s office, Blair was quoted by London’s Evening Standard as saying, “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that will happen, so ...”
When the horse show experts came to Cardiff in crowds to win the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was ahead.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who wasn’t even in kindergarten yet and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee slept smoothly through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both equal in size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had placed his plate cap at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old Toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which were well above his age.
And Toffee received top notes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has practiced every day with the Shetland Pony ever since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great team.”
They had to compete against the entire participant field and left the field with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, “The whole audience was like electrified, and they all cheered and clapted.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
Just as he’s started, it won’t be long before he’s on the “Horse of the Year” look – and I’m sure he’ll perform well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together, they are a great team.
Jurors rated Fenton and Toffee based on how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the show ring.
They looked after good collaboration between pony and guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s cute clothes contributed their part to making it a perfect fit for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be ‘reformed’ after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had demanded the release of a reporter accused of defamation on the front page, was to be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to counterfeit reports of a state-owned company.
Now the New Express is undergoing a “comprehensive rectification,” the regulator said.
The “rectification order” was issued by the Guangdong Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television Authority.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the Neue Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several false reports on the publicly traded company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the Neue Express was disorderly,” the regulator said in a statement.
She said they had decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license.
“The Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to conduct a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant managers at the New Express and to immediately review the management team of the New Express.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and put itself behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told state news station CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized I was acting wrong.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page, stating that they failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely enforced despite a law change earlier this year that banned authorities from forcing someone to blame themselves.
Drug tunnel with own railroad between the United States and Mexico discovered
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
U.S. officials described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the finest passages they’d ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized, authorities said.
When the tunnel was discovered, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the court records.
Three men who worked as drivers were charged with possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between ten years and a lifetime.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, challenging drug cartels to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long rail passage that ran from a kitchen in a Tijuana residential building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken about the separation of his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, scheduled to air on Friday, Bloom said, “Sometimes life doesn’t go exactly as we plan or hope.”
Kerr and he still loved each other, the 36-year-old said.
“We will support and love each other as Flynn’s parents.”
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to lexicons, veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, but differs from it in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice cream or a strong edamer, these snacks are not on a vegan’s menu.
Milk, cheese, eggs, besides refusing meat and fish, the vegan does not eat any animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one may wonder, but on closer examination, the vegan diet world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local Reformhouse, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
The native New Zealander has been living vegan for 13 years, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers faux leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
“I don’t want animals to die for me,” says Proctor, the vegan maxim that extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, scramblers or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered brand new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan is not a waiver, not an ascetic, but an enrichment." The assumption that the dietary change reduces the choice of food options, Proctor is more likely to return to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that caused some of the well-meaning attempts to fail.
"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that causes many to quit quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And he says, "Some tastes are not to be fixed on the beast."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste quite powerful.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, that’s legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just about reducing to animal food," Proctor said.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I don’t take any cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan.
"My blood levels are fine, I get checked often," Proctor tells me.
In particular, many vegan critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
“Since animals are fed feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content in the meat you buy in the refrigerator is high,” says Proctor.
Vegans can also eat the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 values are fine,” he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, staple foods are available everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I can find everything I need on site.
I just buy something special from time to time.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but that's what is known to be the case with 'ordinary' finished products as well."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly assumed.
“There’s a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small punches you can get good, if not partially better results,” says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecake Proctor was also able to amaze his in-laws.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new flavor.
This has a dynamic, when you cook together, it has a new importance.
“The situations that can arise are as different as people themselves,” says Proctor.
But, of course, skepticism has already been brought to him.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - with such questions you have to act as a vegan with a sense of fingertips.
“I don’t reject people, I’m part of this society,” Proctor said.
And when viewed more closely, the everyday world does not appear as vegan as it is assumed - and the vegan does not appear as restricted in everyday life as it is commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many doner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates from pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly adjusting to it.
“When I started eating a vegan diet 13 years ago, it was all much more difficult,” the New Zealander can find a development: “You have to talk to people, make them aware of it.”
"If enough demands come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible from the outset,” says Proctor.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially if one learns to understand that even in peanuts animal additives can contain as colorants, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the following ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
It is not only for this reason that Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also detergents.
"Slowly you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to. "Sometimes it is better to take small steps than to stand or stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral pointer that strikes the conscience.
He may not be able to get rid of his habits altogether, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in the air.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger failures at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday had the indices of the Nasdaq not been calculated for an hour due to errors in the transport of data.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in just one week.
Initially, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively flawed purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
It took the stock exchange operators almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all U.S. stock trading came to a halt due to a computer outage on the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
Last year, Facebook’s IPO also caused a stir.
The Nasdaq systems had failed to cope with the flood of purchase and sale orders, the SEC later found, giving the company a record fine of $10 million.
Constance: 63-year-old rider
According to police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., riding a women's bike was unregulated on the left sidewalk from the station square towards the marketplace.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped onto the sidewalk from a restaurant, the cyclist was unable to brake in time, according to the police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground and drew a 15-centimeter long space wound on the head.
An ambulance team took the injured person to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police order Assange to extradite
British police today handed over an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had received an “invitation to face” inviting him to appear at a police station, adding that if he failed to comply, he threatened to be arrested.
Assange threatens to be extradited to Sweden on charges of a sex offense after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to the extradition earlier this month.
He feared Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, but on June 19 he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
"Scotland Yard has sent an invitation to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time chosen by us," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage charges after posting more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Drivers who raced at 210 km/h and had hot drinks between their legs get <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 penalty
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Howie pleaded guilty before the Colchester District Court without taking the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a victim surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London’s speculation bubble
The Treasury Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who imposed a 7% stamp tax in the 2012 budget on homes costing over <0xC2><0xA3>2 million, as well as annual fees for buyers holding homes as a company rather than an individual.
Already, revenue from the stamping tax on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in tax year 2012/13, exceeds revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: “Following the increases in the stamping tax on high-priced homes and the introduction of the associated legislation against circumvention, it is hard to claim that high-quality real estate is too low taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“However, this move could make some foreign investors more restrained when it comes to buying real estate in London, or deter owners from selling it,” he added.
Top-notch real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the affluent southwestern London belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8 percent last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" in which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) were upwards, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the connection between a dog’s tail swing and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail swinged more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “It is well known in humans that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that provoke positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail swing of their peers, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, in the other
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a true version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (from the perspective of the wading dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog that is fouling), then their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience what movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said, “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the tail is more related to friendly behavior in one direction and the right side is more likely to produce a less friendly behavior, then you react based on these experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand their animal’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
Another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada said: “Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when their ‘tail’ swings left rather than right, rather than getting restless – exactly the opposite of the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could be caused by the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw said.
Since their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to illness Alex Turners
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer has suffered from throat inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was scheduled to play at Hydro on Friday.
Due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, however, the concert has now to be moved.
The band's announcement came after having previously postponed a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After deciding to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with throat inflammation, which is why he unfortunately cannot occur."
The show in the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which in the Hydro in Glasgow was moved to November 21.
All tickets will remain valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience caused by this.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the election of the pope - this applies to a group of 120 "elected cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting of all the cardinals would be held before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, was held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible cardinals is likely to drop by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of cardinals eligible to vote again amounts to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wishes.
The Consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At present there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was "well possible" for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation – this is all quite new.
Valero said that bishops from large places would typically be called to be cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he appoints.”
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the US to repair the seat backrest
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest, according to a U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulator’s announcement on Friday.
In some of the carriages, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is driven up from the rear, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury," the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a statement.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
Delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading U.S. car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively impacted auto sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, rose 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Despair of an Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare that drone attacks
Obama's memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It’s a book that I thought would cheer me up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and depicts the memoirs of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election.
When I’m done with my patient transcripts and go to bed in the evening, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could take my breath away.
The election became a landslide victory and news spokesmen paused to highlight the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had 82% approval ratings.
And then I close the book.
To switch back to the present is an evil awakening, as if you were torn from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has accomplished, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that the party-political blockade tactic has overturned too many aspirations to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public health insurance option, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I have reached the end of my attempts at explanation.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to listen to foreign heads of state or kill innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans and why whistleblowers who disclose state misconduct are being punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without prosecution, nor why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that says the White House’s efforts to calm the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And recently, it can’t excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the passing of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the MP is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and uneducated alternative, he seemed unable to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with the drop in Obama’s approval ratings to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to get a serious loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania presidential election.
In a meeting with the electoral aides after the decision, he told his staff that they would have to get back on track and follow the purpose of their matter.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental leave
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters could get pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important in deciding whether to remove or cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with a 53-vote lead after the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting process so that it could go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have a system where you invade, enter data into a computer, immediately dial and then at 6:30 in the evening get the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don’t like them?
Nowadays, voting with pencils is incredible.
The Election Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently released a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy was to include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office “very seriously.”
A public office is about the service to the public.
“We seek no reward except that of history, namely that we can serve this community in a critical time,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly on the rise.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities in investigating the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes owners daily.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation ensuing the Libor interbank scandal.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
“Our investigation into this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation reported that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former dealer to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been discharged from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, former chief currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Usher’s Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it has taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks combed instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about this research has stirred traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the huge daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to "one can influence the market even with very low ticket prices".
The news came out the same day as Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated a trader in its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the trader has traded alone and that the matter has been curbed,” Credit Suisse said.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle grounds
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss Meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle grounds on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
It also cleaned and expanded the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house at the back of the property was not allowed for security reasons, as the site is in danger of slipping off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent was attached with the message "We are for it".
However, this did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the Citizens’ Initiative in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins".
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project fail one day.
Talking to many passers-by in front of the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the city project will be better for many, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is delaying those responses further, the BI says.
As we have heard, the public statements of the mayor also have an impact.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the end for the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the citizen's decision.
Some seem almost frightened because of this, others perceive them as a "bully attempt at extortion" on the population, the BI's press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte for Schiris: Mane no Swallow King
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed was the sports director of the "Bullen" from the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous trend that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the category of swallow kings," he said at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
Last occasion for Rangnick’s criticism was Yellow for Mane in last Sunday’s 3:0 v. Grödig, where Senegalese turned an alleged acting into a chaos – which, of course, was none, as the TV images showed.
"A blatant wrong decision," Rangnick said, calling referee Harkam "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same in every situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself wants to have had no contact with his colleague after the scharmützel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who's been offended," the 46-year-old said.
In view of the success, however, Rangnick voiced a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for that: Really good," he said.
There's not much to expose.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
Let's just keep it going.
There will hardly be any changes in the winter transfer period.
There is no great reason to change anything.
"Except for a player who wants to leave the club," Rangnick said.
Supreme Court upholds Obama’s health law
It’s a big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — which compels U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 — is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts took the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also considered that the provision of the Health Act that states would either have to expand the access requirements for Medicaid or would otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding was not constitutional.
The lawsuit was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been decidedly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 run-up to the presidential election.
Norway: Norwegian town lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a small Norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at an altitude of 45 metres, a century’s dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some of the valley dwellers had sun loungers, while others put on safety sunglasses.
So far, sun-hungry people had to go on a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
This basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council had finally approved the 5 million crowns (around 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has been giving the Italian alpine resort of Viganella winter sunshine for some years.
Post hardly empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still on various mailboxes of the central city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of the Post AG, you quickly find that the emptying does not take place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether or not they will be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP’s question.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
The Sunday emptying is an important postal service especially at appointment post.
"This thins this undertaking out radically and unreasonably despite the price increase for letters in January 2013."
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals’ group and city association, supports his group colleagues: “What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times here are clumsily changed or even deleted.”
The post office is a mile away from the town.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Even for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament if the city government was planning talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
As far as he knows, there is also a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has advocated privatizations.
“Then decisions will be made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurt Parking Charges to Rise Strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitively expensive.
This morning, the city magistrate will consult on a proposal by traffic dean Stefan Majer (Green).
Parking fees should be increased by 50 percent.
However, the price should not be raised, but the time interval for parking clocks and parking ticket machines should be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
Parking right in front of the store is "not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "very appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions surprise hosts
With a narrow squad, the Lords I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schulurnhalle in Reutlingen.
The elders were with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
It soon became clear, however, that, even due to age, they could not completely keep up with the rapid actions of the towns of joy.
With the hard and positioned strokes, the Gönninger were extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the middle of the net and were not present in the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all matters.
In the face of this overwhelming and game-determining achievement, the third set was a bit lazy and luscious to the 3:0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, TV Baiersbronn, which clearly won in Nagold, will be a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a heavily contested two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and gifts in the ball acceptance; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes lacking goods and in some critical play scenes, the overeagerness prevented the gaze for possible points gains.
In this very balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical commitment and a pleasurable commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
For the fifth day of care in the wake of the Natura 2000 project in Upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cleared on that day in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the highlight of the Schluchtensteig, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of nursing was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourism aspect, ecological consideration can also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Conservation Department of the Government Presidium of Freiburg explained this ecological aspect following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had assumed the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the view is in line with the aim of preserving the now heavily grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections for artery conservation.
Tribukait said she would not fail at this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these different remarks, Head of Rectory Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been cut in advance, the forest tractor is ready to retrieve if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the open view at the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köppfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstadt Löffingen with its 7,514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own municipal works can be described as an attractive city, so far no second mayoral candidate has registered.
As the only candidate for the succession of Mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer running for office due to age, the 46-year-old bank manager and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been established.
The application deadline will expire on Monday, 11 November, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company he overbotted at Nortel's insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus strikes the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of over $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has expanded its offering several times and has recently offered $4.4 billion.
After being overbotted on Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s patent library.
“Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patent at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so,” the letter said.
Rockstar is demanding high damages from Google because it claims Google’s patent infringement was intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt sworn in first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph is not likely to mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the country’s first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath in front of the 18 judges of the tribunal, dressed in black robes, which is based on the Nile and resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said the 60-year-old Mursi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, since its inception 84 years ago, had mostly been targeted as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer on the new president, and unlike the presidential splendour of the Mubarak era, traffic was only briefly halted so that the car convoy could cross the normally busy road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "replacement wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate for Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring to the end the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Later, Mursi drove to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel playing the national anthem he listened to in a Habachtstellung.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the university's largest lecture hall with vocal choirs of "The army and the people are one hand".
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University has developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi swore a symbolic oath in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken over from the head of state.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not before the parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi’s speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Disco ensures two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", tomorrow Saturday evening it will continue with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers, of course, on both days.
Worker crashed from ladder: severely injured
When a defective external sensor was replaced, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell off a ladder and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior facade of a inn.
As he climbed on the ladder leaning against the gutter, the ladder slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rapist in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died of the consequences of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana was found guilty of the crime at the beginning of the week.
The act sparked horror nationwide.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for the victim’s survival for 14 hours, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so appalling that the nurses needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to having been in a bar with Booysen during the night of the trial.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl’s death.
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from detention because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the proceedings that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rapes are almost commonplace in South Africa: there are about 64,000 complaints of sexual violence each year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s organizations in South Africa estimate the dark number in sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham is the pig's buttocks, turbo mast is not a good prerequisite.
Can the ham you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the way the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat he gets inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can pick up the microphone.
Jumbo seen for strengthening at fast food in Waldshut
"Here I am working on huge quantities," the television makers, Black Forest Ham as a mass product, marvel.
16,000 clubs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television at a level?
Details such as the pH of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
“I’m excited if you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then,” Jumbo said.
The level of private television in pure culture is presented here.
But watching is worth it anyway.
The spectator sees that the dismantling of the buttocks continues to be handcrafted.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire visually remind Jumbo of a "submarine".
The trick: Fir branches in the smoke here ensure the special taste of black forest ham.
20 days in smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feeding.
"It's really delicious," according to the TV star's conclusion.
This will allow everyone involved to live.
Did you think travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to the internet?
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record revenue from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual pre-tax profit of between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million and $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, that means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in the 2011/12 period.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre made eight percent profit in the first half of the year and posted a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on track to record year-on-year revenues before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earnings drivers.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker business travel market.
Similarly, it went well for Flight Centre’s recreational business in the UK, while business customers spend less here as well.
The U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, with a full-year profit expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are being halted to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also includes "unseen texts" in order to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass a standalone GCSE language exam, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will release the new English and Mathematics curricula tomorrow – the first subjects radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Supervisory Authority, will announce a reorganization of GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less coursework.
In a speech last summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was “broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public trust,” stressing that the GCSEs would become “more challenging, more ambitious and more stringent.”
Studies show that less time is spent on math in English schools – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule, from coalition circles it is said that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will likely encourage schools to set more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "right life problems", including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colour strokes will be presented this weekend at the Bürgerhaus.
The reviews were made on Thursday.
Once again, the local association W514 organizes this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the district of Soest show their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobby owners their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges conducted the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is appropriate on the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition takes place on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., which is followed by the winning ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a tombola filled with stately prizes and to a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blonde curls and performs for the first time with a new bubi head.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the Neues Museum of the Castle is about the theme "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical parishes of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Constance Lake Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries, and put their minds on those images of heaven and hell "which still shape our ideas to this day," the contemporary prophetic doctrine of hopes for completion is characterized rather by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been properly expelled by religious criticism," says the speaker.
She has provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks.
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death."
This is linked to the question of the longing that “dreams that in the end everything will be good”.
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 for Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the University of Westphalia.
Johanna Rahner has been a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel since 2010.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg reaffirm their faith at the signing
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the Pastoral Unit at the Kleiner Heuberg have been signed.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the church service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Firm Sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
Over the past few months, under the leadership of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous community members, the firms had prepared themselves for the great feast day.
In different projects, they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and together experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race delights participants
In beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take the round course over the hills around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the organising sports club Illmensee tells us this.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, were also numerous everyone cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in the competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placements at the German championships.
These two were able to set off from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small lead to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
In second place, Pascal Treubel was able to place himself again.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli of the Team Nightmare who made it to the top of the winning staircase.
In second and third place came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A pleasing development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute top athletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to step away from the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk racing team.
Pangerl and his teammates have already twice been world champions in 12-hour driving.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German championships in duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a eyelash final in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to race over the finish line.
Only a second behind it, the routine rider Ballerstedt secured second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann were third in the overall standings.
In the women's classification, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwingen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
Travelling through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote him "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father repeatedly lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that was meant to affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five o’clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you’re not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
There is only one doctor in Cameroon for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffering in Bwelle made the decision ripen to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and provides free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into minibuses and ride with the laced medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to villages in need of help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and the wave – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to attend the festive celebration.
The next morning, the team begins the investigation of hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per ride,” says Bwelle.
They come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village – and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others get crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document required for school, but many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
Surgeries usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is powered by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It’s a strenuous thought, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They’re drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then drives back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free surgeries over the past year and knows that their work makes a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free surgery of a inguinal fracture that he had received now allows him to work again.
“This will change the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his charitable activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who volunteers with Bwelle’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain hands-on experience they would never get at home.
“We can be involved in operations where we help digeze blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
“He’s definitely a hero,” O’Malley says.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he gave to his father gives him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The old man and the sea", is cut on Horst Janson's body.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his profession, acting.
The old man Santiago can't be fooled by fishing.
The two simply complement each other greatly.
It is almost thought that we can see the wrinkles on the neck of the old man, which the fisherman boy Manolo speaks of.
When Santiago is tired of life bending on the chair, that’s true of Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway tells the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and willpower.
Janson is on stage for a long time as a solo actor.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not boring moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings the feeling of Cuban life with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm to it and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A sewage canal from the Roman era is preserved below Cologne at about 120 meters in length.
If you visit Cologne, you will not pass the cathedral.
The two towers rise to the sky about 157 meters, making it the second highest church building in Europe.
However, few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers know that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the underworld of Cologne.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourismus directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacular: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the 1970s the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only what was not too large remained of the remnants of the old city walls.
Most of the users of the car park nowadays also rush past the Roman remains and only park their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will find an archaeological site separated by metal lattices in the D2 park deck.
You can see about five meters high ruins of hand-plate-sized stones.
“They are remnants of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century AD,” Schulze says.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look into a dark shaft, 15 meters deep.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next stop of the tour is the praetorium, and here the participants go down again to the depths.
Here we are witnessing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means "City of Roman law and City of Agrippinensians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for emperor worship".
And the praetorium is the former governor’s palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition, a tunnel leads to the Roman wastewater canal, which is preserved here at a length of about 120 meters.
"You can quietly walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze encourages the guests.
There is still a surprise for Schulze.
After picking up the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16-meter-deep walkable shaft.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep in the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washes.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be seen by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work is to begin shortly.
However, there will be a few more years until it is completed.
Leg almost chopped off: re-release of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment will be re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted murder, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun in the district court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants were silent to start.
They are said to have been active in the rock scene and belonged to the bandidos at the time.
The prosecution accuses them of stabbed and beat three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, there was a chase with several cars.
According to the prosecution, it was about repository fights and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice repealed the judgment after reviewing the prosecutor’s office and referred it to the Landgericht for retrial.
One of the defendants is currently in open detention for another offence.
At the outset, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the night of the act.
As a witness, the commissioner who was then investigating was invited.
In the center were cell phone calls of the accused and other people who had been intercepted by the police.
It’s hard for rockers in court to almost always adhere to a brass law for them – and not testify.
The same goes for the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) prosecutor's office said on request that new traces had appeared since the last trial.
Eleven more days of negotiation are scheduled for the trial.
The disposable company does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it was going home.
Only: In the stomachs of the people in the passenger and rear seat the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What’s closer than chilled to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little bit?
I admit, I’m happy to be there when it’s late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and going to bed!
On the way home, however, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers are noticeable.
Because what do you have to miss if you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with steady regularity?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags are on roadsides and on parking lots.
“Why?” I wonder.
Are people too dumb to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It’s not just that the paper is shaming the landscape.
Bags have also already obscured traffic facilities such as guideboards and caused accidents.
"Disposal society" does not think about this, but probably does not even know what this word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after busy nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage tower there.
There would be a few bags more or less even nothing - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on the food remnants of others.
I see the day already coming when the cities and municipalities will be too stupid to clear their way - and the fast-food chains will have to demand a pledge for their bags.
Obama's retreat in health policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama made a retreat yesterday in his often repeated, unequivocal promise: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands received a letter of termination from their insurer, Republicans in recent days accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can keep it,” he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the terminations, Obama urged those Americans who have received such communications to look around the free market for new insurance.
Most citizens could get better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“They’re coming up with a better offer,” he said.
The government said it was not surprising that the five percent of the population who took out insurance themselves would have to look around for a different tariff because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to tell these Americans very directly: they deserve better,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This remark by an upset Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday’s House hearing was taken up after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long of Missouri about whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the Affordable Care Act's "architect" did not voluntarily give up a state-funded insurance policy to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem not confirms attack on Syrian air base
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous told CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter jets had attacked an air base in Syria’s Latakia the day before.
The target was "missiles and associated equipment" that the Israeli government feared were intended for Lebanon's Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been fired on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, and blamed the Israelis for it.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which were seen Russian S-125 Newa missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, Reuters quotes an anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believes Israel carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense said: “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah earlier, in part successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” that a military response would follow.
John Kerry says in an unprecedented admission that US spying has “improperly gone too far”
With an unexpected admission, John Kerry suggested a softening of the U.S.’s defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying the espionage had “inadequately gone too far” in certain cases.
The foreign minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for switching to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of outrage on the part of its allies.
In a video speech at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “Of course, the President and I, and others in the government, have learned about some things that happened almost by autopilot, simply because of the ability to do so, which can be traced back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to 9/11.”
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too far.”
The President is determined to create clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be impaired in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of goodness and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added, “We are dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is focused on killing people, blowing up the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happened?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people, because we have heard of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. on anti-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to frustration over National Security Agency surveillance.
“It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board in view of our joint efforts to combat terrorism,” Murphy, who sits in the Senate as a Democrat for the first time and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were inaccurate and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents released by Snowden that the NSA monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended espionage among allies as necessary, stating that this was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his authority was preparing the congressional journey to take place this year, hoping the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating MEPs are to be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be some “serious words.”
He said European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they have been using themselves for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also reconcile with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to deal with the resentment of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of the FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz asks for an assignment by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do so individually.
"We will decide in the short term on his deployment," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorer with six goals.
The Mainzers have already to give up the injured top performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, has filed an appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely reached her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to having come up with the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention facility on the edge of Phuket, instead of a adult women’s prison.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian Rubgy League player who has turned to the Canberra State Department for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"Of course we are very worried, but we hope she's back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a bail of 50,000 baht on free foot.
Australian reports showed that she is on vacation in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand in the meantime.
The court had heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that after the recent assassination of travel shopkeeper Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its bad tourist image, and therefore there is a freeze.
