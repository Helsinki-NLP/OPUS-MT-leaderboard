Members of the Assembly (AM) of Wales worried about 'looking muppets'
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that this can be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned "that he rhymed with Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A Member of the Welsh Party Assembly commented that his entire group was “dissatisfied” and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that MWP's pronunciation jump to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the designation of the Members of the Assembly will be the responsibility of the members themselves."
The 2017 law of the Government of Wales gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option gained most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who should send the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say in the question of what they should be called when deliberating on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighboring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price you have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the older people I’ve spoken to say there was a bar and church on every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there's not one thing or the other."
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People now socialize in a different way,” he says.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that the neighbors go to regularly.”
Concerning churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that “before or after, they will return to the starting point.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people that will not help the shrines left in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore will accelerate the closure of these churches, as most people who move into these apartments are unlikely to end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 30s of the 20th century.
A black congregation worshipping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of St. Martin, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while parishioners of Father Johnson made plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the lane.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called it “the campaigns of the poor.”
In July, the carillon expert called it “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the world’s first carriage used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left to play the largest Riverside Church carriage 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "attempted to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for locusts in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for locusts in California the day the locust season opened, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego’s KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, so he approached with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about capturing a lobster, but then he realized that "he was screaming that he had been bitten.
<0xE2><0x99><0xAA>
He had a broken collarbone," Hammel observed when he came to the boy.
“I shouted at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark,” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
The first responder, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablad, to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans boost UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specializing in the hallways of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>28 trillion and with growth rising compared to falling sales of fashion and homeware, the largest beauty halls will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successfully overcome, will be the same in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the shelf space that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also test its concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second at Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift to daily purchases of small amounts of food in local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said stores will look more like shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to fight discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets in hundreds of stores and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is believed to have boosted grocery sales and made these acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to split revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of Sainsbury’s 281 pharmaceutical stores to Lloyds Pharmacy’s Celesio for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s commented, “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles in ways that enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specialized staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offering is designed to suit all needs, while an attractive environment and a comfortable location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks an 11 million-pound deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, left "furious" after television host Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million-pound deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to dedicate to the fashion and accessories brand Truly.
This business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by leaving her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when the golden girl on television admitted that her new deals, valued at up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, gave no time to devote to Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and profiled itself as a favorite to double Willoughby’s fortune of about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source said: “Truly was by far Holly’s top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would hold her for the next two decades.
His decision to quit left all involved totally amazed.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow headquarters, ready to go on sale."
Experts believe the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that last night “we didn’t talk about business issues.”
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of “news presenter.”
“I haven’t given up on anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in reuniting with him after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Negotiations for denuclearization, however, have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see a “adequate response” from the US to the first steps towards North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he said, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s outlook was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
“We have a great deal with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: an end to missile tests, help to free hostages and bring the remains of U.S. soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had had to move, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, which complicates things a little," explains Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are still unsure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not as many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, travelling from one island in Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure upgrades the centerpiece of his electoral campaign, and has allocated plenty of money to roads and railway lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr. Joko’s administration, which faces a re-election next year.
In addition, it must face pressure from Indonesia’s persistent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch this: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool matches the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 meters from Chelsea's goal when the scorer was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second stick.
The action sent him over the area and headed to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the net.
“I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very far ahead, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think too much about it, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midpointer made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before turning by dribbling near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out on the midfield.
Afterwards, he made a nice space pass that led Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and finished by throwing the ball into the net of the second pole with a kick with the left foot that Liverpool’s Alisson Becker couldn’t stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will take place at the San Paolo Stadium, in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
Indonesia’s tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of casualties from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country’s emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during Friday’s 7.5-magnitude earthquake that unleashed waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews, on John Street, which resulted in the arrest of a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who has been near Jonh Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to pick up something on dashcam to contact us as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman came to the crime scene to find out where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his apartment, but police tell him no one can enter or leave the building.
He was perplexed when he found out what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed to re-enter in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the place in tears.
He keeps saying, “It’s terrible.”
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cord and one outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cord controlling the floor block.
Anyone with information is asked to email DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, September 30, registry 247.
Cromwell’s Statue of Parliament Becomes Last Commemorative Success for “Rewriting History”
His ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by his puritanic fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that removing the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
He may be sacrificed to the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is proof of the 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a fully accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-seventeenth-century conflict has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A swine killer attacks a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a Southwest China market, according to local media.
The man, identified solely by his surname “Yuan,” was found dead with a blood-covered, sectioned artery near a piggy bank of the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig breeder is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs from a piglet in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said that in the piggy was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-pound pig had attacked the rancher to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and broken,” the cousin told The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, as police collected evidence at the scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, it is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 295 kilograms cornered a farmer in its tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After, in 2012, pigs were eaten by an Oregon rancher, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of the blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intent is not to hurt.
What we have to do is have the proper respect for them,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rains in the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it travels over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind gusts of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, from Sunday morning at 5 a.m. (Eastern Time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are beginning to be generated, moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to propel the intense tropical rains northward, southwesterly of the U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when tropical rain collides with the approaching low pressure, there will be widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows, and possible detachments in the desert.
Intense tropical rainfall will cause rainfall of nearly 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rainfall are expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding with rapidly aggravating conditions is possible.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into swampy rivers and storms will cause cracking winds and dust clouds locally.
The looming low pressures will leave heavy rains on specific parts of the southern coast of California.
torrential rains may leave up to nearly two centimeters of water, which could cause small debris flows and make roads slippery.
This would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaparrons will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before rainfall is widespread late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes in the U.S. can be observed due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes this involves drastic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across central America on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 7-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., a warm beginning of October is expected, with widespread temperatures going around 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures as high as 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probabilities of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the appearance of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed the heartbreaking testimony that Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an allegedly successful sexual assault in the 1980s, gave Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the policy continued to stalemate and the media interrupted its usual schedule to broadcast Friday's latest news - a deal designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Blake - for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a drunken state and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people commenting on Nielsen on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of a playoff football game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose fans have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fuels the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement stating that he would vote in Kavanaugh’s favor, on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters screaming at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a court hearing.
While receiving these reproaches, broadcast live on CNN, he was downed.
“Looking at my face,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
And he continued, “You have power when there are so many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he would tell more in his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and radio broadcasters broadcast everything live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's Senate candidacy for vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate over the next week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was critical, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘politicizing’ Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics with her plan to leave the European Union of “making politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is arriving at the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers’ alleged Brexit plan, saying a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge each other’s tariffs was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After interrogating Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A bail of $350,000 has been set, according to the defense.
Baton Rouge District Court of Inquiry released a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death had been a bullet wound to the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police forensics lab, Southern University police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, sports director of LSU, thanked police forces in the area for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was “devastated” and “in shock” over Wayde’s death.
“These are the things that people always care about,” Wade said.
A volcano throws ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods south of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash lining the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after independence protesters faced anti-riots as thousands participated in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by riot fighters threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Clashes also took place in later hours and police used batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with messages such as "neither forgetting nor forgiveness", faced unionist protesters at the cry of "Viva Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by an overwhelming majority, although participation was low, as people who were against the secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent votes at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
Independence groups camped Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy to be able to vote, but now we’re stuck.”
Despite achieving a vital, albeit narrow, victory in last December’s regional elections, pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detainees, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in custody since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested for Crashing a House with a Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly hitting a Londonderry home with a car.
The incident occurred Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the entrances and to the building itself.
At some point, you may have shot yourself into the car with a crossbow.
Menga strike grants Livingston 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by winning the second loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference. Gary Holt's men rose one place, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard’s have yet to win any away from home and next Sunday they face the Hearts, leader of the table with eight points ahead.
Earlier, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, has expanded their divisional winning streak to six games.Holt, head coach, has not yet tasted the loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities in front of a stubborn visitor
Holt’s team had to have gone one step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson overcame the defense, but failed to make his attempt in front of the goal, after Alan Lithgow was shot out after entering to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause visitors problems with standing ball plays.
This is how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers granted them a free kick and Livingston sought an entry, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession, but couldn’t pass the host’s defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was pretty calm.
That game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor rejected a kick from Scott Pittman, and Lithgow was far from another move from Livingston.
Long passes were constantly entering the Livingston area, but they were always cleared. Two penalty requests were rejected, one after a Halkett entry over alternate Glenn Middleton and one by one hand.
Livingston's "Phenomenal" (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for the Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and squad have barely experienced changes since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the moves, as they only managed to get into the opposite field once, which is a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came in the immediate vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies after collision with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy highway from Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by paramedics, but died right there.
The accident comes after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that ran off Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from Saturday’s crash site.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been cut off and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Injured After Riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation in a high-security men’s prison, according to the Prison Center Directorate.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, involving eight inmates and affecting a pavilion.
Agents were assisted with minor face injuries at the site.
A prison service spokesman comments: "Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to address the ongoing incident in Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
Violence is not tolerated in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time behind bars.”
The Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, riot fighters were asked to go to the prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It’s uncommon for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the last hurricane pink hogs cross the southwest of the desert, at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had retained their tropical storm or depression status within a radius of 321 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rainfall, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Escarpment, Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rosa’s rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious issue, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions that are currently experiencing in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the itinerary of Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, who on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum gusts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to recede in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout Monday afternoon.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
“Turrency rains of between 7 and 15 centimeters are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters,” reported weather.com.
Afterwards, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then move through Arizona to southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The main danger of Rosa or her remains is heavy torrential rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and southwestern U.S. desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden flooding and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects of an attempted murder after another 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 p.m. Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains “stable.”
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
Agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened on the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the pettyness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“To vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the pettyness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago as teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, the "Americans saw the cunning, quality and bravery" of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a lawyer with an admirable track record at the service of the public,” he told his followers in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh’s candidacy when talking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“There are five weeks left for one of the most important choices of our lives.
I don’t show up, but it’s a race,” he said.
“That’s why I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump alleged that Democrats are embarking on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunamis, the number is on the rise
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the massive waves raging the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When it was warned yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not arrive alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, ravaged everything that was on land," said Nugroho, who had traveled through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s great earthquake was 200 times that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the 300 km coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake’s epicenter.
Communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received much criticism for failing to report a tsunami hit Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast by the time the warning was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, you hear a man standing on the top floor of a building warning people that he was on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, leading ahead buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending aided cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but the evacuees still need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's a really bad thing.
Although Donggala’s World Vision staff have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under tarps installed in their office gardens, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen a lot of homes destroyed," he said.
It's a really bad thing.
Even as the relief groups set up the disaster assistance gears, some people regretted that the displacement to Palu of experienced cooperators was not being allowed.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a catastrophe at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Indonesia.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn’t happened yet.”
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of people who were still missing still hoped that their loved ones would be miracles that would bring some light to the heartbreaking stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days beside her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor for Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
“From my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional load,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the release of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival held on the beach.
However, their messages only showed one check mark in gray, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during an ATM recharge in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves raided a Brink employee charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the leisure center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man “runned up behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of the money destined for recharging.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the site, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will begin to be named Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
For some time now, the 41-year-old West has been dubbed Ye, a name he used as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had religious significance to him.
“I think it’s the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year as he talked about the album’s title with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
He went from being Kanye, which means ‘the one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad, and confusing things, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed the name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West contributor, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case letters, with or without script.
The Mexican AMLO vows not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican president-elect, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he "would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were gaining ground throughout Latin America.
López Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He claimed that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double I.A. funding.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in AI research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the A.I. announcements from various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official A.I. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the No. 1 innovation in IA by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. We have our eyes set on the next breakthrough in the field of I.A.,” Lee says.
Double funding means double the chances that the next major achievement in I.A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most important I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that beat Othello's best American player. He was later executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the next one, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired prominent people from universities to work in I.A.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its I.A. initiatives.
“I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically,” he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to attract partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name will change to "Republic of North Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidacy for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, a majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The following question was raised on the ballot of the referendum: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their votes.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote in Macedonia’s referendum on a name change for the country that would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs in front of tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to come in like Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says joining NATO would provide the much-needed investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published Monday by the Policy Research Institute, it was assured that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than the required participation.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV, from Macedonia, revealed that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch this: Manchester City's Sergio Agüero dodges all Brighton's defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win that Manchester City won Saturday at Manchester's Etihad Stadium.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a midfield pass at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He avoided one defense before beating several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who struck him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
“Agüero has some problems with his foot,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League contest.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball deep within Brighton’s territory.
He made a nice left-flank ball pass for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few taps before directing Sterling to the second stick.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net just before leaving the boundaries.
City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena of Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies' party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to kick the mound against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if they triumphed against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League, they still have playoff opportunities.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still pursue their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can step on the gum with the certainty that the Denver public will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I've ever faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but it seems they are inclined to let Scherzer go into that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal break on Sunday.
Washington’s right-hander record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
Five weeks left for one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the most important, I don’t show up, but it’s a race, so I’m going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates.”
“We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see pettiness, wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to pass over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
“We’ve seen it for the last four days,” he said, saying the Democrats “were furious, they were bad, they were horrible and they were fake.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by appointing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the booing from the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already embraces a wide range of views.
He is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was barely surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row of Labour Party Members of Parliament who are told they are not welcome, and just for saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. It is ironic that these were issues where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a Member of Parliament of the local Labour Party, that’s exactly what the General Committee’s Friday night meetings have been like.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "kinder and kinder" policy is already more than forgotten, if ever it was actually applied at some point.
It is becoming increasingly clear that discrepant opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and take positions he would never have agreed with, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is an outpouring of insults on social media demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every "censorship" motion or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice that recommended keeping my head down and not making myself hear so much and that so “would be fine.”
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a high school student, motivated by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a minister of government.
I have never concealed my political ideas, not even in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions or the areas in which I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand this desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading toward a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and utilities.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the match may have decided to some extent the final result, but Ayr undoubtedly deserved the win in this very entertaining match of the day of the Tennent's Premiership.
Now they top the table and are the only undefeated team out of the ten that participate.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to take better advantage of the opportunities, that gave the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"They have put us to the test in every game and we are still undefeated, so I have to rejoice," he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie commented: “The Ayr deserves recognition, they seized the opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute rehearsal, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan for the game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this opponent's disadvantage and Jason Baggot got an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, just in the middle, he scored and turned a solo rehearsal, leaving the score at 17-5 in favour of Ayr in the break.
However, Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption by a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, whom they had to pull out on a stretcher, and, as the match resumed, the Ayr advanced with a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to re-take advantage of having one more man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine rehearsal, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for scoring Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson did a rehearsal when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
Climo converted it, as he had been doing almost since the match resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent the Gregor Henry wing to the bottom for the fifth rehearsal.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the catering sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move into the catering sector after it is revealed that he has been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the BBC's famous show, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “flourishing catering market.”
"The sea belongs to us": a landlocked Bolivia has the hope that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings wave navy blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the longing to sail again the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will vote in favour of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who wages a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have hampered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, would use the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to end nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues paralyzed more than three months after this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean War to subdue the North is a “chimera.”
Washington is suspicious of accepting the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament move first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, widespread skepticism reigns over Pyongyang’s seriousness of renouncing an arsenal that the country probably regards as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric oversized hats for their spring summer 2019 collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that enveloped the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons with jewelry, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also featured a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips and reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation reminded of a complete dive team, snorkel and glasses included, while another looked like a molten ice cream cone.
If you like oversized fashion, you're in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could begin to be seen on the streets of shops.
The big hats come in hand-stepped from "The Bomb," with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters worn by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this hat so impractical that it flooded social networks presented another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag as big as the model in swimsuit that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the main piece of Jacquemus’s La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "Next summer, I expect to see huge hats and beach bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are critical for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary exam results that is reinforced by the individual and collective successes harvested in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS), strive to deliver the highest level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools are intended to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message reaches his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it reaches his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest passing rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that are part of the SCIS, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages by considering them a fundamental competence that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission on Employment and Competences found that, of the reasons employers gave about the difficulties they faced in filling jobs, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Potential job opportunities that require languages are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically advance the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, and the only two-digit language spoken by a percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
If they know several languages, especially those in developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centers will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, independent schools can always choose between several languages taught by teaching staff specialized in this subject.
Scotland’s independent schools devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At this time, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be considered "competencies for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges.
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans hoping to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play the pre-season opening match Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a few limited minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career I don’t need preseason games to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at venues with supporters such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate’s confirmation vote to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court pending, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s appearances by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which were strained over allegations of sexual misconduct and have left on hold an early Senate confirmation vote for at most a week as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections gain momentum.
President Trump’s campaign said next week’s five rallies are intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they retain in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena tonight's rally could attract "Ohio and Pennsylvania" supporters, as well as have coverage in Pittsburgh's media," West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates that they dare to fight to keep hope alive in the face of Sunday’s individual matches.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse swing pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So where would they say the momentum is now?
“They brought us six points ahead and now they bring us four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in favor and plenty of reasons to be animated, among other reasons for the pair formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
The guttural shouts of celebration rose in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt that the game gave them in the 15th was met with a similar scream, from those who transmit that they believe the American team has not yet been left out.
"What we need to do is redouble our efforts and focus on the game," Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup story.
The strange and adorable couple from Europe takes four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way its energy flows with the bustling public make it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Still, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, after partnering with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn’t get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help coming out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see up close because you appreciate the interactions between couples, the tips they give and the ones they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead in the face of the last day, but this foursome session also demonstrated that the US team dares to fight, something some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe ahead of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a score of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two wins over a hard-hit Tiger Woods, four points ahead in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
Jim Furyk needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to beat a discouraged Woods and US rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who hadn’t highlighted too much in Saturday’s two games, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome games, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to be Henrik Stenson's pair in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and number three respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its part.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as references for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They got an exciting 2-1 win over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovering from a four-point difference in individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs one draw to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their chances.
North Korea says "there's no chance" of unilateral disarmament first if they don't have confidence
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister informed the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the international body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important measures of goodwill” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities, and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we do not receive any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence with regard to our national security, and under those circumstances, there is no possibility that we will first disarm unilaterally.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints over Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as he did not simply reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons sooner.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose coercively, including by objecting to a declaration of termination of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, hymnally announced by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, South Korea’s leader, over the past five months, and added: “If South Korea had been the interested party in denuclearization rather than the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles toward U.S. soil after “evil President” Trump, on a suicidal mission, called Kim “rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in advancing disarmament, but said much remains to be done and that sanctions needed to continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set deadline for this: “We can take two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its advances.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we realize definitive and fully verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying advances had taken place, but a few hours later, North Korea denounced his "requirements were those of a mobster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had informed him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on How to Rest Enough
Thanks to a new course taught this year at Harvard University, all college students sleep longer in an attempt to fight against the growing macho culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, is believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
Her motivation to launch the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked me why she just learned about this now, in her senior year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a routine for going to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it’s not going to change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He claimed that the culture of pride in “spending the night on a wake” still exists, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure students face meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and a good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, which is why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
He hopes the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal tombs Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression away from home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox wanted to make their first home win since the 4-1 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team defeated Gerrard’s for a second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving their team eight points away from the Hearts, unearthed Ladbrokes Premiership leaders.
Menga’s attack occurred minutes before halftime and the Rangers’ uninspired lineup was not up to date at any time.
Now, the Rangers go down to sixth place, Livingston goes up to third, behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers may find themselves in more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly threw an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard moved to eight of the starters who won the game against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 Livingston players who scooped a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored two minutes before the start, when Menga made a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs pulled out an in-depth foul for Captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send her out by the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly felt penalized in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears to the Colombian’s request.
The Rangers scored two goals in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely found himself struggling to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's boring pitch.
Although Livingston’s 34th-minute goal came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs’s deep standing ball play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher snapped the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the steering wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly stepped out of his line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to take visitors to exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow rematched a header corner that did not enter.
The Rangers' substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now, a page of the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTANTING... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since been a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronado," with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting on your headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them.
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer,” such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a diatribe in favor of Trump wearing a MAGA cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to debark against the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white man and he asks me how I like Trump if he’s a racist.
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the Matt Damon sketch show in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's anger to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
Also, West told the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes for wearing that cap.
“They messed with me.
I was told not to go out with the cap on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how asleep I am?" and added that he was "going to put on his superman cloak, because that meant no one could tell him what he had to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments received bugging from the public on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: "The study was totally silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West surprised many when he went out on stage to sing I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE MULTIUM."
Karen Hunter, host of an interview show, tweeted that West was simply “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
"But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying their music or clothing, or supporting their art) who I consider is embracing and spreading an ideology dangerous to my community.
He's free.
We too,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, not forgetting the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear Monday at the Belfast Court of First Instance.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying those screen roles often aired to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes “something has gone wrong” and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he finds it "quite important" to address this issue.
“Personally, it seems to me quite important right now, where have we been wrong about masculinity?” she said.
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?”
Kit believes that television can take part in the responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its masculine characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it’s clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that he is "full of battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard’s theatrical play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he’s ever gotten out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on."
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 on a Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly to parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who get HIV in this way has declined in its entirety, Chinese health authorities said at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT collective suffers much discrimination.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are because they do not use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a member of her staff leaked data from Republican Party senators and claims that it is “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican Party senators on Wikipedia's legislators' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said those allegations were driven by commentators and “extreme right” websites.
“Lies, lies, and more vile lies,” Waters said in a Twitter post.
The published information allegedly included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown Capitol Hill person posted the information on the internet during a Senate panel session regarding allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came at some point after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and made the data of a Waters staff member public, according to the Capitol.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not at all responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Deny this information with anger," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that you don’t have the temperament necessary to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He must not rebel.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
It must keep calm and serenity.”
It seems Fleischer wanted to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday’s appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to debank Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent allegations.”
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered, and that they are held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all my staff.”
Review of Johnny English: Again in action. The parody of Rowan Atkinson's spy is short
It has now become a tradition to look for nods to Brexit in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what it is to do with this new installment of the parody action comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-satisfaction about how clearly foolish we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his leaping eyes and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to kick the butt for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemaphile territories.
Of course, it’s the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of throwing away glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that kind that touched a single note on the theme of Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
In addition, it was originally based on the mysterious traveling and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last installment, there are one or two good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as the propellers collided against the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy leaps into sight, but the humor gets pretty short and is oddly superfluous, especially now that franchises of "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible add comic ingredients seamlessly.
Humor seems more aimed at children than adults, and to me the absurd misadventures of Johnny English are not as ingenious and accurate as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated current argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s supersecret network of spies, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent in service, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous, entrained character who’s watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character who’s almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t leave much room to work.
Your intelligence advisers inform you that, as all active spies are in danger, you will have to turn to someone who is retired.
That has to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches in a pijo school, although he gives unofficial classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy academy similar to that of Rock School.
English is moved to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his long-suffering former buddy Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not taking enough advantage.
So, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic billionaire from the tech world who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of the house of Volta.
Definitely, they were thoroughly employed in that last sequence, but, as funny and bustling as it may be, the ensemble continues to convey a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but charge five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan that the British would work with four days a week, but would charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business owners to allocate the savings made by the AI revolution to workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea “would fit” into the party’s plans and economic agenda of inclining the country in favor of workers.
This shift to a four-day week has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: Announcement of a revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
“It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At the moment, however, not the entire Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of party policy and is not going to be discussed at this time.”
Shadow Treasury Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference held last week to expound his idea of carrying out a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was willing to retrieve powers from "anonymous" and "utilized" directors in charge of public service companies.
The shadow minister’s plans also include the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies will not recover their full stake, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of directors of companies and create inclusive ownership funds in which it is necessary to allocate 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in '60 Minutes' about FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for his confirmation as a Supreme Court judge at least a week and also raises the question of whether the results that are concluded could influence any Republican senator who ultimately decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could uncover information that made them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out, and I asked him, ‘Did you do it?’
He was firm, resolved, sharp.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immovable.
“I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and I would overlook the charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it sharply," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she names have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive poster of stars gathers for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people travel to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free admission to the event (unless you can afford a VIP admission), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what has the Global Citizen accomplished 12 years after reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of so-called “clictivism,” which is called the stance we take when we think we’re doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “shares” from its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have gotten world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 225 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and announcements that emerged from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that secured funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based association of investors and executors united with a common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential". To this end, Rwanda has been proposed to provide $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens collaborators.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of the social injustice of malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, “The Power of Nutrition” ambassador, told the crowd during an April 2018 concert in London.
The group also claimed that, after carrying out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
One Global Citizen contributor responded: “It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the movements for human rights and against apartheid have already succeeded, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the performances we will have at this year’s New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy to block Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
“If necessary,” Washington could resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
“I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe,” he said.
Furthermore, according to official information, there are ways and methods of dealing with this issue.
"The United States, with its navy, has the ability to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not run out of the market," he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a not-for-profit group that is defined as the “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to harness and replace fuels,” he warned, pointing out that Russia can only do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims come as the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relieve of function to Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do so, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is solely for economic reasons and is yet another sign of unfair competition.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, in Moscow last September.
The American stance has, however, met with Germany’s rejection, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The industry-leading organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to look closely at running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would consider joining the presidential race after midterm elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being posed.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally have women among the leaders,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a City Hall appearance and said he was “taking the country the wrong way.”
“I’m really worried about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren stated that "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
A poll was published on Thursday in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run for the 2020 election.
58 percent of “possible” Massachusetts voters said the senator shouldn’t show up, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% of respondents did, however, support his candidacy.
The poll expressed stronger support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other recognized Democratic Party members spoke about the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation my son is going through, from everything that has happened since he came back, is well known to the other families who suffer the effects of PTSD and other wounds our soldiers come back with,” he told the public who gathered at a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "come back with a different behavior, hardened, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to get a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy for the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district filed a “friendly” letter Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name has not been disclosed in the “Grace v. Sessions” case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Migrant Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum in the country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy “ignores decades of international, federal and state law.”
“Under federal law, all asylum applications must be failed by virtue of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also indicated in the letter that the policy denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by saying that they often become entrepreneurs more often and "suppose a necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“People who leave their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or threats on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or a particular political opinion can apply for asylum,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, faced by people around the world on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll increases in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
“The situation is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search among the few flooded belongings left in an effort to recover what they can.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to continuous, also very strong replicas.
He couldn’t help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to get safe.
I was trapped in the wreckage of the shattered wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, as he and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propagandistic advertisements”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily’s pay supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to meddle in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, something China is adamantly denying.
Trump’s accusation of Beijing’s attempt to influence the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials pointed to Reuters as a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish announcements to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently stranded in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels on imports by both sides.
China’s countervailing tariffs that were applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall to exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, which is one of the top exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, China “is further intensifying that pressure with advertisement postings in our free press.”
“To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press when trying to publish a payment advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, at the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, you can only see a few discrepant voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that people in China can have about the troubling trajectory that the economy of their country is taking, as the media is controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most relevant newspapers circumvented the offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify what newspaper it was about.
Analysts say Republicans are distancing themselves from women ahead of midterm vote with Kavanaugh’s debacle
As many reputable Republicans are closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there may be a setback, especially by women, in the upcoming mid-legislature votes.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have expressed that they want to move forward with the vote.
“In such matters it is not possible to turn back,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s latest attempt to stand in favor of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters displeased with the matter.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget it tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters who gathered at the doors of the Senate sang “November is coming!” at the time when Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is out of all odds," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among undecided women in suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who don’t usually vote even if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony in which he detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that a setback could occur if Republicans proceeded with the confirmation.
“This matter has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, NBC News reported.
“It’s no longer just a matter of the committee vote or the final vote, not even if they sit on the bench for Kavanaugh; it’s also about the way Republicans have handled all of this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, said in a statement.
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who they should believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who stand on the side of the latter.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony definitively or likely, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh definitively or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh was lying during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s statements, as well as, at least, those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh raped her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web considers launching a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project in the tech legend, a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“It has to be now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique in the storage of personal data online is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and skills needed for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the staffed developers who were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could build their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change will be introduced where all their business models are completely modified overnight.
“We’re not going to ask for permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that “its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this upcoming era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Cleric Who Won a Cross Victory in World War I
The only cleric of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received this award on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "cross a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so big that I can never reach his height, but they were very enlightening."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a flower crown after the parade, which featured the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evident when he is shown such a large backing."
MMA fans were awake all night for Bellator 206, but only watched Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so that in the end you won’t be allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose cartel had 13 matches, six included on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live overnight on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some weren’t surprised after they had to stay awake until early in the morning just to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the switch to cartoons as "a heavy joke."
“There are government regulations regulating content that is broadcast from 6 a.m. and this wasn’t appropriate, so they had to switch to kids programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, said when we asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the little pig, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will modify the program to include British viewers in upcoming editions.
“When I think about the relay option, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn’t do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a lot of messages were received and not everyone was kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise that next time it won't happen.
We’re going to reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally did. We tried to offer more than usual so the fans were happy and we had fun.
It is a very unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a winner.
At age 24, he told us that he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “not everyone was like me.”
On Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs show, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention in talking about gay rights was to transmit "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to downplay the fact of winning at the Olympics.
The regular host of this mythical show, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who showed himself as an outcast, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "it was not socially accepted that you liked boys and girls."
He said, “To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has really given me the power and strength to succeed.”
I wanted to show that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to pass on that “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion stated that for him it was also a surprise to fall in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who took her 20 years, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you've lived so long as you were young" (it went to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone the same age who's gone through the same ups and downs as you.
The couple had a son in June who they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global outlook" had changed.
"If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have revolved around 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, no doubt, Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had the London 2012 passes because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I wasn't able to tell him I wasn't going to be able to be in the front row," he said.
“I had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that very moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At that point I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine in an Olympic Games, there was nothing better,” he said.
This was also the fact that inspired him when choosing his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to reverse his shape if he wants to keep it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years to score a record for the 12th time, was knocked out by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has done so many times for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to settle for cheering in some moments and, in others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of the drivers, even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National course, where the rough long continually punishes with wrong blows.
And, if the field is no longer daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games they’ve played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below at the start of the 12 individual matches, started in an impressive way, Mickelson’s match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, nor could he say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role he had today, he slapped me on the back and, surrounding me with his arm, he said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I thought they would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s mark of more Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the last in a Ryder Cup career that has never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought much more intangible values to the team.
“It’s fun, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players have loved to have him as their support, also this week; it was fun.
It brings so much more than just play.”
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that even if you enter with a substantial lead in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where one side captained by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to knock out the others by stepping on their heels by a minimal margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we did a great tournament at Valderrama; we did it at Brookline and we lost, we did it at Valderrama and we won, but for very little," said Bjorn, portrayed, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and leading him yesterday with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
“History will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal to fulfill, which is to win this trophy, and that’s the only thing we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are very aware of what’s on the other side where they are, no more and no less, than the best players in the world.”
Proud of what his players have done on a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to get ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is the individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you’re there alone, you’re testing all your skills as a golfer.
That’s the message that you have to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it’s up to leave your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as couples, with exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
The same Furyk has been at both ends in the final days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe held the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
“We have 12 super-important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole tour," Bjorn said of their individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it will not be done until at least next year due to faulty systems and progressive cost increases, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship leading the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to statements by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery bothered the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and very reduced acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) to be already outdated when they begin service, Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 frigate held headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – half of the personnel on the former Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is excessively overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as other similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), rather than the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of the recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is “leaving out of ships capable of deploying.”
The officer said the problem has worsened over time, because the old boats were decommissioned, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been conducted in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to discover how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
Everything that is found is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as Daubenton’s coastal bat and long-eared browns from the Inverewe Gardens at Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at strategic locations on the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to find out the frequency of bat calls and which species do.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, expects the results to reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticidal papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind,
but because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in the field, who are dedicated to conducting regular surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues.
The organization has even inaugurated the first and only reserve dedicated to Scotland’s bats in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says it’s the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave, we have a fantastic bat area," he said.
“We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there is still a lot unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, as a breeding colony can be involuntarily destroyed and 400 females and offspring could be killed, which would mean annihilating an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species about which we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers chase German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has categorized rape allegations as “fake news,” saying people “want to make themselves known” at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
Portugal and Juventus strikers are accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of having paid him $375,000 to hide the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already accumulated 142 million followers just hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, branded the report as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false,” says the five-time Ballon d’Or winner looking at the camera.
“They just want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same old story.
They want to become famous just by mentioning me, but I can't help it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations appearing in what they have called “an unacceptable report of privacy suspicions,” Reuters reports.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident apparently took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had disappointed that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but was consenting.
Mayorga also claims he went to police and took pictures of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because he had "terror of reprisals" and was concerned about "being humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old woman claims she is trying to overturn the deal, as she remains traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged assault occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has switched to Juve, an Italian football major for a €100 million contract.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing automakers
The UK would “repent a lifetime” if it lost its position as a world leader in auto manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" for Toyota UK to tell the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby, would be temporarily halted.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of customs delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain breaks with the EU by the end of March, there will be production shutdowns at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s general manager at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have expressed their fears about leaving the EU without a deal, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns raised by automakers revolve around issues that could arise in assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on just-in-time or last-minute production mode, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, there could be a disruption at the border that, depending on the sector, could lead to delays and the lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to house the amount of material equivalent to more than one day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in such a case, production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which establishes future relations with the EU, is “precisely calibrated to avoid such checks at border crossings.”
“We need a deal, we want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now, but we have to seize the opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“Toyota’s evidence, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a tremendously successful supply chain set.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would be halted, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the Unite union at the plant, said its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover."
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and convincing plan outlining our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “postpone another week,” as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in Russian elections, links between Trump aid and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation of whether Trump decides to fire the Deputy Attorney General or not and thereby compromise Mueller’s independence has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he was wearing to try to relegate the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, on Monday he went to the White House, among news reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was at the time at the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “No date has been set, it could be this week or another could be postponed, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We’ll decide on the move and I’ll report to the press, as I usually do.”
Some journalists would refute that claim: Sanders has not held any press conference at the White House since Sept. 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the motives were.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting grandiloquently, although he said: "I did not disagree with the fact that they brag."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more question and answer sessions than any other president before him," he said, citing without evidence: "We have contrasted those numbers."
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking the President of the United States directly, I think it's much better than doing them to me.
We tried to do it many times and you’ve seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week in New York, the president demonstrated why he was so, where he made an uneasy and sometimes bizarre appearance to the journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of State for Health writes to NHS Scotland EU workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and its desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit have been followed in which they chose to make the decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible scenario on which there would be no agreement.
I know all of this must be very disconcerting to you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much I appreciate the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we would love to keep counting on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie was surgeoned after suffering a head injury last Saturday when they lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee’s Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“He came to the band and collapsed right there,” Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A Tennessee State staff member told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details yet about the type of injury or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with whom he scored a total of 18 in the entire season.
Foreigners will be charged a higher estate transfer tax when buying property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher estate transfer tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised with this measure will be used to shelter the “homeless,” according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the estate transfer tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to go to the ‘homeless’
The additional money raised with the increase in the transfer tax from farms to foreign buyers of properties in the UK will go to aid to the “homeless,” Theresa May announced today.
The move is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and harassment to those with higher incomes.
The increase in the farm transfer tax will be taxed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will go towards incentivizing the government’s policy to combat the problem of street begging.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are purchased by people who do not reside in the UK, leading to rising prices and making it difficult for people who buy for the first time to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a transmission tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large builders of maintaining very high prices on properties by avidly buying land without intending to use it and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the "shameful housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of unreasonable evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of each new generation.
And that involves solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult for many people to achieve and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland’s coach says his “primary goal” is to become Scotland’s coach at some point.
The 42-year-old is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the northeastern club, which currently occupies third place in the League One (the third league division of England), three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and it’s something that’s always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only come true, however, if I manage to run a club successfully.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland leader include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he moved on to such established names in such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, success for me is measured based on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club undoubtedly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I’ve achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it should be.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a time as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts coaching team.
Afterwards, he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren move from being on the brink of descent to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
"I always thought the direction was what was best for me, much more than playing.
It might sound weird, because it was good, I was able to make a living very well with it and enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that job; however, in the direction I feel good.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’ve managed to do it, it’s the time of my adult life when I’ve felt better, no doubt.”

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heatwave has boosted profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but it has focused all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant profits dropped 4.8 percent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin of the consultancy for CGA companies, which was responsible for compiling the figures, commented: "The heat these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup has still kept the pattern of the previous month in July, where pubs increased their profits by 2.8 percent, while restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant business activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered from the heat, though not as drastically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out to drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose as much as 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman of the hospitality and leisure analysts at RSM said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the market for activities outside the home.
It’s not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year is going to be especially painful in view of continued cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food operators and weather will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide the relief they need.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents’ backs
One in five children (some even 11-year-olds) have secret social media accounts behind their parents’ and teachers’ backs, a survey reveals.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed growth in fake Instagram pages.
News has exacerbated fears of sexual content being published
20% of students said they had a “main” account they showed to their parents.
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake accounts on Instagram, a referral photo-sharing site.
The news has exacerbated fears of sexual content being published.
20% of students said they had a healthy "main" account that they showed to their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who came across the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter saw a teen encouraging others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Federation's directive
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be a member of the board of directors of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track and field athlete and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from its great international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from having her on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I like to be the spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert at the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine whether or to what extent I would recover.
It’s been exhausting, but I managed to fully recover, I had to learn to walk again and I’m currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
Announcement of the "Scalaleches" comparing mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A squid company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares mothers who breastfeed with cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what is theoretically the “world’s first silent sweater,” consumer tech company Elvie posted an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music showing mothers who tell the freedom that the new milk extractor gives them.
Four royal women dance in a barn full of hay as a dance floor, along with some cows, with lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not ugly, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Order them, milk them, I'm feeding their babies, milk them, milk them, I'm milking my wives."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created a huge controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the “horrors” of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth in order to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away days after giving birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: “Traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?”
Another comment was, "What a crazy announcement."
However, other people defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "debunking."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still sucking, I'd probably have one.
Using the pump, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I don't give it any more spins.
It’s a product genius,” one woman told us.
Another person told us: “It’s a funny ad for mothers who use a breastfeeding pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is totally silent, has no cables or tubes, and fits discreetly inside the breastfeeding bra, making your users able to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, comments: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and dairy cows, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and near way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has been featured in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded down the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Discreetly Displaced to Texas Border Camp
The number of detained immigrant minors has increased considerably, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has practically remained at the usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that the fact of proposing to welcome a child would endanger their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Office, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Around 80% of sponsors or their families are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these people,” Albence said.
In their effort to prosecute minors faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month from detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to workers at the shelters.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who do not consider themselves eligible for amparo will be deported as soon as possible.
According to foster workers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
According to advocates, these concerns are further escalating in larger facilities, such as the one at Screw, where, due to its size, signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked.
In addition, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria Calls on U.S., French and Turkish “Occupation Forces” to Withdraw Immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country’s war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is practically over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were adequate for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that made the refugees decide to stay outside the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault on Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and has expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who “will be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, arguing that the panel’s work should be restricted “to reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are sure to expect, an impeachment or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment, no signs of fatigue are seen in the viewers.
Since 2014, the maximum audience time rates have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and have virtually tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in top viewership hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed cable channel indices with 3.5 million viewers for major night news shows.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still can’t understand,” Neal Baer, the author-producer of “Designated Survivor,” an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride he made in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the reply that Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families can reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you’ve been watching a panel of experts discussing the use of “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket (“a garment of excessive pride,” in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of the anecdotes.
As far as I’m concerned, I’ll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s partly what makes everything look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he tells us about the alternate cast of Trump’s show and his daily twists on the plot (either entering an NFL fight or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode if you don’t want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was refugee inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
“I remember when in those days we were doing all that program madness and people were telling us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss tells me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows in tighter midterm elections in the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise the influx of money is reaching Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburg, whose structure was recently redesigned, has Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another re-election candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding contest for the campaigns between the major financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for the Pennsylvania 18th Congress District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, though after it backed down
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization administration team.
State Department officials have decided to return heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of around 140 million U.S. dollars in 2017 for, among other matters, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration into the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear their intention was to keep the conference going, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which diplomats see as a sign of the importance the administration has attached to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman in Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next planned step could be special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstruction of Trump’s justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also leading this investigation into the possibility that the Trump campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to stand again before voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditional, and with that I don’t suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to coup against Hitler, but the West had to resist him and support the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has seen himself in a good spot since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to take office.
Rosenstein says The Times’ explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his office in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
On top of all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will find a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I do not think we will fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"We managed to get a good point, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game believing we could get something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, the tie was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out for all and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve all three points, but it will be a difficult game because they already got a good result in the previous game, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there’s a general atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team is fine, the guys are enjoying it a lot and we are having a good training.
I hope that we will be able to move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.”
Fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose their sleep
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their relatives.
About half of those who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about this issue.
“People want me to take care of them by a family member, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to get care, as those options can be a cost determining factor.
Incorporate in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of legal battles.
Ensure you get a health care power to designate a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that professionals fulfill their own wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You can also prepare a notarial power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you become disabled.
Don’t forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just finances that are at stake: which doctors do you have to deal with?” asks Martin.
"What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to have everything planned.”
Man shot several times with a carbine in Ilfracombe
A man with a carbine has been shot several times as he came home walking after leaving at night.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
Their injuries are not fatal and police have appealed to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said.
With the communications blocked, aid officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Belt of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and often suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake ravaged southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that affected the southern coastline, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it recalls the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it caused no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska state police.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin has been ordered pretrial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held with an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He filed for court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked for his testimony, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a penalty of one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, interfering in the reporting of a domestic violence crime, and possessing a weapon in a drunken state, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed to have punched him in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of fatalities
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to downtown Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social networks that show the timing of the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental van last October to carry out a bicycle lane attack on Lower Manhattan’s West Side highway, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists he encountered in his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed all eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily injury, according to the notice of the intention to apply for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed with Saipov a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of organized crime murder, which federal prosecutors typically use in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good for what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be raised in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a conviction with life sentence without possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" of eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's deputies suggested that he should take care of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided ranks has further highlighted when a group of pro-permanence Tories have joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep up with the compromise plan that was signed at Chequers amid attacks by Brexit pros, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and “chaos.”
Deputy Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a responsible position in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have left,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I’m going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false.”
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: “I’m just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like Chequers’ plan, the opposition is not going to vote in favor and is not popular with our party and our activists, who are actually the ones who go out to the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to May, he added: “Prime Ministers keep their offices when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told concentrates that politicians should be "feel the heat" if they were to see that they would betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are going to mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, pro-stayers roamed the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists were waving banners of Tories Against Brexit after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party application during the conference’s inauguration.
“These are the same people who tell us they can deploy the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland.”
“It’s a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers every chance of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider every chance of running for the presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a city meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.”
One Arrested for Gun Murder of LSU Sims Player
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that eventually led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a gun and firing at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 1.98-meter-high Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders hand him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter boxing and let Hamilton run in the group’s tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out forcibly one lap later and stood behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after an action with the wheels almost stuck that made the Ferrari driver reluctant to leave the interior free at the risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and placed in seventh place at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race while clinging to his tyres to achieve a quick end and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Eventually, he entered boxing on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by regaining Raikkonen fourth place.
It’s been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman by letting me by.
The team has done an exceptional job of getting a perfect match," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accused Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, disgusting, and false.”
“The only thing that could happen and the good that’s happening these last few days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting, and fake,” he said.
“When you read the posts and the leaks, and then they say, ‘But if I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Well, wait a minute.
We've leaked...? No, we haven't leaked it," he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.”
But his refusal didn’t seem to sit well with the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented, “I’ll tell you one thing: that was really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the wickedness and disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control,” the president said as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the back game on Saturday by 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial lead of two goals thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie won the local draw before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This has been the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer’s first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided assistance for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan returned to the home team looking forward to playing in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to match the match in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard matched the match once again with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game by reaching the end of the second half and secured victory with his team’s fifth goal as they approached the end.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller killed so hundreds of people could escape in earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to beat the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stood firm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian channel ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken when we hear this,” he added.
The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many corpses under the ruins and not many people have been contacted," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told us.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, who will hold a massive funeral on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in in military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute there comes an ambulance with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors as much as possible, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been struck earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia Air Accident: Air Niugini Now Says Man Disappears After Air Accident in Lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared, having said the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated safely the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon he could not realize a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been moved to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
“That’s an extremely good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said flight attendants panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were performing nearby dock improvement work also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the aviation safety network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
Analyst Presents Timeline of the Night A Woman Was Burned Alive
Prosecutors ended their arguments Saturday in a new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took to the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s van that night, Sanford said he was “lying, because my van was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He deleted her from her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be in the hands of the jury that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop has departed from its origins of political messaging and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a 'racist' text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies that it is racist and compares the lawsuit to an “extortion” case.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay when she discovered that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK PERSON,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her crooked paw, an "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice claiming that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and instead expected a Filipino woman, the New York Post reported.
Maurice received the pay for the day’s work and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the layoff with the intention of receiving a compensation of $350 a day for the six-month internal position they had been hired for, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that things aren’t done that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they are racist by saying that terminating Maurice’s job was the most reasonable thing, as they feared they couldn’t trust her after offending her.
“My wife had sent him something he didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on!
Comparing the lawsuit as an “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to get someone that way?
That’s not that it’s a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It was difficult to get in the shoes of someone who was reading it for the first time before it was published.
It’s so funny to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
Having said his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before he drew inspiration from a toy bear to write the children’s book, was confident that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the books’ publication was somewhat “sweet” after his passing last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a very quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” he said.
“But since Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who accomplished something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was urgently transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad was calling regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he was not expected to make it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to maintain the pumping of his heart slowly depleted and left his system.
She had died before time and everything was going off.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, alien to the terrible experience that was going on.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
"I bowed my head and tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning put cards to prevent suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any place.”
However, he left the job before he died, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards “so people know there are people you can go to and talk to, even if they’re a friend.
Don’t sit silent, you have to talk about it.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Davies’ friend for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or anything like that,” he tells us.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas Day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t even look at them.
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: "Leave a void in the whole family.
It left us torn apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins investigation
“I thought if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a time-limited, limited-range investigation), maybe we could bring in some unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going to a spike” amid a partisan shutdown.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
His refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
If, as expected, Republicans have poor results, their attempts to win the man they want for the country’s highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korean Deserters 'Down' with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said there were 1,127 defections last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and high tariffs on human traffickers have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments about it.
The vast majority of northern deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and is often repatriated.
North-South relations, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which generally agreed to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances we will by no means be the first to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh "Hysteric" and Says He's Not Fit to Serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a “hysterical” and was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she's hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh used the excitement to deny allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his years of high school.
On the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the allegations against him “grotesque and clearly coordinated defamations” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed his bias against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and the Democrats got a majority in the House.
“I’ll just say one thing: if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won’t be fit not just to be in the Supreme Court, nor will you even be fit to be in the court where you’re now practicing,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible sentences against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and hope that we feel like everything is okay,” Pelosi said.
And women have to handle it.
It is a justified diatribe, it is months and years of fury overflowing, and she cannot let it go without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's that weird, do I?"
She continued: “A woman who was an executive at some company helped me a lot and told me that she was crying when she got angry, but that she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
Well, no, I'm angry."
And then I went on with what I was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for rabies in part because they basically don’t understand each other well.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the cogot and dragged me onto a staircase.
“Don’t let them ever see you cry,” he told me.
“They have no idea you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll rejoice because they think you’ve been cornered.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado Democratic congresswoman, had worked with Gary Hart in her presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which she had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea that she would run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-premeditated decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As the campaign was already very advanced, he was left behind in fundraising, so it was promised that he would not enter the race again unless he raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on attracting voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism) that she choked.
“The logical thing would have been to think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said, recalling the press reaction.
“You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you going to put on my gravestone?
“She cried?”
China-U.S. Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The first salvos from the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while much remains to end the battle, a break between countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in products, taxing half of the goods entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has retaliated equivalently, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match U.S. attacks, and it is unlikely that the world’s second most powerful economy will loosen soon.
Achieving Washington to back down would mean giving in to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make the conditions set to start a plunge in the economy in either country is actually far more dangerous than viewers have recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused associate researcher for the strategic cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria ready for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has already been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation on the ground is today more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normality.
All conditions are already in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country and in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the North American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris (France).
The United States now has six consecutive losses on European soil since last winning a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water in hole 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell defeated by 5 and 4 against the player with the lowest standings of the European team, the Dane Thorbjørn Olesen.
World No. 1 player Dustin Johnson fell 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most tournament wins of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a very hard year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy that I was able to recover the cup.
It’s an achievement of the whole team and I’m very happy to have been able to help,” said a thrilled Garcia following the European team’s victory.
Now he passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who already beat U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 on Sunday in a singles match.
"I feel an incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, as I've grown up watching this man," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, leaving only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m very proud of these guys, they’ve never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we ruined it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Their 12 players have made a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it's up to us to bow our heads.
They've overtaken us."
