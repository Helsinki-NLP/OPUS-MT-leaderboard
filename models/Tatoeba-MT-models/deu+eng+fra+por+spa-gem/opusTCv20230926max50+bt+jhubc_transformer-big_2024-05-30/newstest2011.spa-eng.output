The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the pastry shop
The new councillors of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in the capital will apparently have to overcome the obvious language barriers for the components of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their renewed SDG partners.
The Actuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz period "examined" the members of the new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Council to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when Prague's current coalition members ruled.
The codified dictionary used by the political flower and cream of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
“Who is Voldemort?”
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I'm rather a novice in Prague politics," said cultural councilor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kaucký during the examination of "college" terminology.
And as far as the political veteran was concerned, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted the same way.
You may know the concept of "golf hole."
"Perhaps it's the only expression of all you asked me to use from time to time."
"If not, I usually don't use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by the newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial board chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "bull nude", "treason of the capital" and "blind".
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do so.
“I don’t get involved in these things and I don’t think I’m going to appreciate how civic Democrats have fun.”
“What I care about is how we will get along in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As has been seen, Councilman Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kaucký allegedly did not realize that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" says nothing; the only term he hit on the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
“It’s about the Blanka tunnel,” says Kaucký, who immediately adds: “But rather I know it from the news.”
“I’m going to have to sign up for a language course,” he jokes.
Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the environmental councilor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plachý.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort really is and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plachý even knows where to find that character; moreover, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it is soon revealed to Plachý that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among socio-democrats.
“I asked my teammates, but it really feels like we don’t have anything like that.”
“Rather, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or we make word games with the names,” says the chairman of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague, Petr Hulinský, whose partymates call Hulda.
“In school I was called B<0xC5><0x99>íza, but I don’t know if my classmates also call me that,” says her own nickname Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tested the name and it works.
For his partymates, Weinert is D<0xC4><0x9B>da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the election deceitful during party sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" ("playmobil") from some of his comrades.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulinský does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The Doctor of the Rights of the Beats" as it appears he recalls Petr Hulinský earned his doctorate in law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as published in a pamphlet
Women considered as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually old, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "turn back" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the town.
"Men rarely suffer such a sin."
"Healthy young women are not isolated either, because they help with labor and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state, Burkina Faso is occupied in a special residence of more than one hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information brochure that should help prevent witch hunting.
However, this has a catch.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” warns the newspaper Die Standard of the disadvantages of writing awareness.
Witchcraft accusations are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman got caught in the oil that is used for ritual anointings.
It set on fire when the group wanted to "drive out evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of “witches” is supported by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “The devourers of human souls have always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that allegedly had been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help him he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, forcibly took men and women randomly chosen from the Gambian peoples to the president's property in Kanilai," the report said.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a pocima of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that also caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the detainees did not survive their stay on the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detainees.
Bakala tenant: warms up with coal stoves and signs higher rent
The man, old and tough, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal tycoon" Zde<0xC5><0x88>ek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he had documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his own, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is serving sentence.
All three have just caught the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 CZK per month, the child will pay 4,100 CZK from next year for a two-room apartment with a separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, he does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, over whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and indecent", recommends tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But in the face of this, man only makes one ademanent.
“Everyone says a thing,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great test laboratory for liberalization.
After New Year’s Eve, the vast majority of flats in the Czech Republic have so far been rented under a regulated rent.
That is why Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to pick up number.
"Rent 2011", can be read on a light button of your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost no time to read "157" and already the number appears on the big screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly couple comes to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for settlements, insurance issues, and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of between 15 and 38% in the charts.
On November 18th, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
“It’s been running for a week, so it’s starting out,” they reply, after briefly doubting, the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old Bakala miner floors are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were already treated loudly and clearly by the Vice-President of Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
“I didn’t even change the damn bathroom plate,” the man mentioned in the introduction loosens.
According to the workers, for the moment, retirees come more than anything to check if they receive a discount on rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half of the February rent discount.
However, the window of mining “liberalization” certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubt.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about forty or fifty people for the rental in 2011," the employee of the window estimates.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, the matter must be resolved by an independent judge.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and fully lawful way to proceed," RPG said in a statement.
"No one's going to be judged here," says one of RPG Byty's employees, and a man standing in the street in front of the customer service center gives her, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court,” he says.
But immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see."
“Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait,” he says.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not cover even the amounts necessary to maintain the community fund," recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that annoys the tenants is, for the landlords, the main reason to increase the rent.
While during the five years that elapsed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rentals in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that stands out in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square meter per month," it said.
Only increased by 38% the rental of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square meter,” RPG says.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not suddenly affect rents, but will escalate between four and eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rise of the rental (see the graph) again in the floors, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to people who sign the rental increase agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need nursery
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with all the same to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to her.
Architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio came numerous well-known buildings from Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guardianship.
At the company, around 90 people work, mostly at the age of the baby boom, and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, daycare is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Design to its workers as part of its social program.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-guardianship was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of the management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-guardianship is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment, as well as the Czech Republic’s state budget.
Thanks to the funding granted (a provision of more than 2.8 million CZK) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding runs out (two years), Arch.Design is obliged to keep the mini-gardenhouse running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the submission of the funding application.
The care of the children is in the hands of qualified staff. In addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The daycare currently hosts children without age limit, although most of them are under three years old.
Since it is a "mini-guardian", it can accommodate only a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The functioning of the daycare is flexible to accommodate the needs of the parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the daycare, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-curriculum programme are comparable to the usual preschool curriculum.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class has not only toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up kids from school late when they are away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the signed companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced the marketing of personnel.
The House of Bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Watch Gaudí’s interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its skeleton-like shape, locals dubbed it "the house of bones".
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade reminiscent of the scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and wildlife.
Paying more attention, we observe a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Snake and the twisting of the shapes continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies window frames, railings, door ornaments, lookouts and signposts.
The Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gracia, emerged from the remodeling of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of making a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their plans of the project adornments emerged for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration on Casa Batlló’s proposals was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and Gaudí’s Park Güell, where other pieces of it are located.
Due to its organic form, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones" shortly after its completion.
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it "the house of yawns".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, appears the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Its inclination of forty-five degrees may be strange.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect at all the building rules of the time and was not influenced by them.
Still, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, upon its completion, the city hall was so impacted with the result that it requested it to be corrected.
He was annoyed, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
Arrangements were never made, rather the contrary: just fifteen days after the city council’s request, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors was installed the owner himself.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase leading up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked on the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can thus communicate seamlessly, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and skylights.
The play with the two colors brings maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the rays of the sun.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house you will find the most spacious and recharged apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and expanded visits to the common area and attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entrance of other buildings of Gaudí in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and the boxer: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really gives its quality to a good bed is the surface for lying down, i.e. the mattress and the boxer.
First of all, they must be complemented perfectly so that they adapt to the specific users.
During the election numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and box box is located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that doesn’t usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they “heat” more slowly.
In addition, they tend to weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the channels of the center are not properly aerated and, above, they are on a firm base, they keep the moisture inside.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft coat and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, hard surface.
“Almost all of the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"These types of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have problems with the nervous system, so they misreceive information from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in quilted furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem anymore, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes your stiffness and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard match.
He just sleeps better.
The viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to your height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, e.g. singles, a minimum of between 120 and 140 cm is recommended.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when lying on your face, you should have your hands comfortably shrugged towards your elbows," advises the engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert from Cechu <0xC4><0x8D>alouník<0xC5><0xAF> a dekoratér<0xC5><0xAF>, who has been working for many years on the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture.
In double rooms, each needs their own boxer and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the beds at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with springs interior a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and smoothes.
"By touching it with your hand or sitting on the mattress, you should certainly not notice the docks," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of box box.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe poorly and cannot wash their cover, which today is often done.
And, since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has an but.
For this reason, vendors give a tip: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of cleaning and washing the cover, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although zippered mattress covers are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when they are opened they are left in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling on larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a boxer, do you have a firm board?
Never! Never!
As much for the beds designed for one night visits.
However, you should make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes in the board and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For sheet beds containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although a bed bed with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar zone are stiffened and can be regulated, is always better.
Articulated sheet beds should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "rode" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is very important.
They are even remembered by mattress makers who, in the "males", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are beds with cross structure or boards with so-called multi-twist damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is reduced.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the right mattress and boxer, if you use a bad pillow (large and "mully"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on your side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder reinforcement boxer or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses seem to have something to do with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use more and more natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
The petroleum-based raw materials, with which the polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "cooled" with vegetable extracts from the breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "warm" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel warmer.
Favorites currently?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various stiffnesses of cold foam and viscoelastic allow to manufacture mattresses of various zones that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you from seven thousand crowns upwards.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT rate, since they are considered as health facilities.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and beds.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam attached to the cover for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is free of charge.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as a material for NASA, because during takeoffs astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Consequently, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is used not only in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents use people tracking devices to monitor their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about GPS monitoring.
The system, initially designed for the tracking of vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a match box, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people feared the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We're all trying to tell each other that this isn't about spying, but another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy," said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone's bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
“Most customers actually buy it for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková warns that if the child does not want to carry him, he will simply throw him away.
“Even the youngest children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to keep them from being controlled.”
“Before, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In his opinion, it is questionable whether in the event of an attack such a device is really useful.
“If it’s a prepared kidnapping, the perpetrator will practically always check if the child is carrying some type of electronic device that can reveal their location.”
"Now it's the phone."
“As the use of tracking devices continues to spread, it will also look for them, since their sale will certainly be carried out with a lot of publicity.”
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised pedophile attack.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can serve as a help.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period of time."
"If he suffers damage, at least he will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The more expensive devices have an integrated tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and stands still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, on which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices that are similar in size to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Macro Weil's Pilin, for that reason, tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
"Or to identify him after a certain amount of time, which can save the police time," he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the checking of the position with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to surround the whole of the Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to ignite explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of wick to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the wick for explosives from the STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The General’s staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick by saying that soldiers need 60 kilometers of wick a year for training maneuvers.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnics of the army, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided however that, in such a case, such maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives each year also all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want exemptions, neither the Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr nor the captain of the army Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could the army be justified in spending sixty kilometers of wick.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
If so, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the engineers or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
Soldiers in the Rapid Intervention Brigade personally complained to Minister Vondra recently because they said they barely had ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices were limited for money.
And let’s not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also can't understand that we are repeatedly bought such amounts of wick."
“But it’s their decision and they’ll undoubtedly know why they act like that.”
"For us, the army is a good customer that we, as a company, try to satisfy," admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>cký.
Ministry of Defense spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek defends the hundreds of kilometers of wick, saying he will also have stocks of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>cký, of STV Group, indicates that the wick only has a shelf life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, two years.
"If stored in perfect condition, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
At the end of its service life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of wick, it got a discount.
“They cost us 60 percent less than last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” said Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence’s shopping centre.
Just to compare: the annual wick consumption of the pyrotechnics of the police, which eliminate the munitions of World War II or left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only the right amount to deplete the ammunition before its useful life runs out.
It was decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of wick can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of 200,000 people was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: we will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I still live from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
The fact of winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun in selling the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition, won the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun de Liberec.
His success story seems to come from a movie.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that Liberec needed quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he met with seasonal work abroad and a credit from the bank he bought a house that was half-broken composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
"At present, the value for money of the accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He began renting the rebuilt first floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned invested them back into the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in business, it managed to gradually open in Liberec four guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” said the number one businessman last year.
"To this sale of licenses for the opening of hotels greatly helped the fact of winning the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' contest," Pytloun added gratefully.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in and around Liberec.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” he recalls.
It certainly recommends everyone who wants to try some company to participate in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live on the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest, I started collaborating regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
In total about seventy.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that has earned general recognition.”
“It’s not, much less, my own personal success, but it’s the result of the hard work of the whole team.”
"Only my name appears on the front page," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we have had at Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>árský, received the first prize in the last edition of Vodafone's "Company of the Year" contest last year at the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition,” said the winner last year.
The history of Farmet starts with a desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>árský’s father to rent a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of property during Communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position at the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They gained a greater presence also among the non-specialized audience after achieving success in the media contest.
"Not only did our customers begin to consider the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value the collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>árský.
Last year was perhaps not just a show of victory euphoria at Farmet.
It also gained recognition for its commercial results until 2008 and, in part, from 2009.
2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet hit so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"Of course, we don't get rid of such a situation either."
“Income fell by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>árský.
A viable company must sometimes even take unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and kept the company’s profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of all, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training center, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained excellent ratings at national fairs," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>árský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are rising again and, with them, the number of new employees.
“The new achievement hopes to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>árský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity Survey of the Year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration asked for an extract from the trade register, although its officials can get it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the trade register when it conducts a check on the insured's impositions," said <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová.
The objective of the Absurdity Survey of the Year is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
For the fourth time this year, he participates in the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny business tournament and begins to create an affinity among the general public.
While last year’s edition saw the participation of 3,000 voters, this year it virtually reached 4,000.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that need to be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in terms of the number of papers required for the tax return we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have a company, the Czech Republic is in position 74th, that is, eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organiser of the contest selects seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet via www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Earn the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than one hundred were submitted for this year’s survey, including 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals this year is published on the page of the contest.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world often participate.
This year, for example, the contest was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
“Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state continually impedes entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” announced Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in the water of borage.
In 2007, what disturbed people most was the employer’s obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanently operating area, the intention of attending a stand at a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended in second place in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the labour office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is the winner.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny contest is the category called Responsible Company of the year 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way, we want to support companies that are concerned with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of the main competition of Vodafone Company of the year 2010, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between them, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is, for example, persons with disabilities, in other cases, personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from across the Republic was, for example, the software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has already been the main donor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, there is a stationery shop that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the workforce; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the contest Vodafone Company of the Year finished third in the region.
In Olomouc he won accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which cut working hours even below the 35-hour weekly average, without cutting wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment," explains entrepreneur Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová.
IT company manager Enlogit in the <0xC3><0x9A>stí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; also supports work from home and at business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona in Trouble scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says company representative Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Suchý.
There is also a mention of the laundry company Praní a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>ní in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that have an impact on their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, skills improvement and leisure," says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D>, from the construction company of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of Responsible Company of the Year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest were automatically nominated who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it to the organizers before August 15.
Organizers removed incomplete or incorrect forms from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the contesting companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Competition of Responsible Company of the Year, but are not disqualified from the "Main" Competition Vodafone Competition of the Year."
“Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as this is a subcategory of the Company of the Year main competition,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose Advisory.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police have made several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land is received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million crowns for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public bidding," Pilsen Attorney General Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that at the moment she cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, police released the 46-year-old businessman.
How he could influence the public auction, given the limited official information, can only be speculated.
The spokeswoman for the Lubomíra <0xC4><0x8C>erna Agricultural Fund responded to Právo’s questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
“This is a customer, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public auction is called "Call for Proposals for Land Transfer in accordance with the Land Law" and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a value higher than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Based on the bids, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest bid," the Fund's spokeswoman explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had information on who was to be submitted to the call and, since he was also an interested person because he had acquired various rights to restitution, he proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
For such a favor, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of his arrest, he had so much money on him.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has just obtained land from the Fund for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular where a large road to the industrial area of Borská Pole should be built.
Afterwards, he exchanged them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the very historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city had to intervene because otherwise the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Homes will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to take out of the portfolio, starting in January, several hundred crowns a month more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas around 2%, in some cities will have to pay up to 10% more for the supply of water and many also increase the price of central heating.
The increase in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 more kroner per year than it is now.
However, the main electricity suppliers lowered prices, as support for energy production from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaic, has increased.
However, the gas becomes moderately expensive, especially at the time when heating is used more and therefore, the higher the consumption.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive across the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 more crowns per month for central heating since January, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 more crowns per year.
Prague residents will also have to endure a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially in the event that the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rental does not vary, the Pragues will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will increase by 7.4%.
The rent prices of 450,000 flats rented in Prague can be increased considerably, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 floors in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, will increase rent from January by as much as 100%.
The company will take to court those who disagree with the new rental.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase next year to 10 percent.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in mode, because it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from his parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
“Drinking beer or wine is no longer in fashion, because it takes a long time to get drunk.”
“Now the fashion is strong alcoholic beverages,” Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán, head of pediatrics at Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia, told Právo.
"When they manage to get a bottle from their father's cupboard, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
“Vodka has the advantage that it lightens with juice and doesn’t smell that much,” he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman of Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally it's Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
“In some cases, they use spirits they picked up at home,” Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, thirteen- and fourteen-year-old drinkers usually appear in hospitals.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, plus a mixture with ecstasy," the department's doctor said of the case.
"He was at the Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother wasn't even surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours," he said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot speak properly of dependence.
"An alcoholic is a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, 40 drunk children were hospitalized in Motol’s pediatric clinic until mid-November this year.
However, the statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and should remain in the hospital.
The young drinkers who, after the ambulant medical examination, go home with the parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink spirits, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs to mention: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for bad grades or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
“On Witch Day I’ve come to see up to seven drunken children on admissions at once,” Pelikán adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and the nutrients that the body lacks.
"They get it much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and do not hurt anything."
“They are only confused about where they are,” Pelikán says, adding that patients often lose their mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
The ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients cost tens of thousands of crowns.
“I have often used cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer on a youth job so that you would earn enough to pay yourself that night,” Pelikán adds.
Health insurance, in his opinion, perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for treatment expenses, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time such a device has been in the hands of anyone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad for internship or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which until now was used by the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The three remaining aircraft are the single-seater L-159.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peje<0xC5><0xA1>k of the defense press department says it is not yet known when the planes will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, with no investments or additional contributions from the Ministry."
“The two-seater L-159T1s were exchanged in their current state,” he told Právo Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army is not running out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for the amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft has already been received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS pledged that the aircraft will be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the EADS company is the one that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for the practice of pilots from NATO countries."
"Therefore, it is up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek says.
The newspaper Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny published beforehand that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense management claims that the exchange promotes future export of L-159 overseas.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by making a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last is expected to arrive at Kbely airport in Prague within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer magazine.
They could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple proof of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Accordingly, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, says Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indica finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same chances of developing prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
For men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men with ages below 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "demonstrated completely".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, was snow-covered on Thursday.
The roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and the snow removers circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC5><0x99>edního automotoklubu (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
A truck crashed at mile 91, while two industrial vehicles crashed at mile 93, resulting in injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the trench.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway on the kilometer 185 in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
Drivers must drive slowly behind Brno on the 190 km or cross Brno and get into Kývalce on the 182 km.
Stages of several kilometers have formed there.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7oC.
Stages are forming, for example, in Prosek, although <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí and Nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí Míru.
At eight o’clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven by three connections quickly.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check the current situation.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> airport closed from eleven o’clock on Wednesday night until five o’clock in the morning.
Currently, you can already drive on most of the roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brn<0xC4><0x9B>nska snow tongues are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
In order to clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment, it is not possible to say when they will be opened to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bíle Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfall gradually returns to the Czech Republic.
American Soldiers Have a New ‘Smart Weapon’
The U.S. military is employing a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being solely by the codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the progress of the game" to their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with extremely precise targeting.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall, or a trench.
Without a doubt, normal protection can not be used and, when he launches his killing rain from metal chips, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then gets a precise sight point and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say they've been measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the gun is loaded and the projectile is thrown at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs are being moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer industry giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July the following year from its previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the district of Niederrad in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term another 100 employees of the consortium, which were previously spread across the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, “In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday sparked joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt's head of the economics section, Markus Frank (CDU) said that it has earned a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent acknowledgment of the site."
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu’s decision.
The management previously informed the city of its intention.
“Of course we have offered the company our help,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons led to the fall.
In such a way, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The building previously used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of a controversial spa town construction project with the remaining buildings on Marienbader Platz for ten years.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism regarding the massive construction that used the gaps as parking spaces and regarding the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment counseling and appraisal companies, the software manufacturer for reservations systems, Start Amadeus, were installed, as well as then joined Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu consortium is recognized as the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, yet Fujitsu has more businesses in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is located from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
That is why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the office building of Astro Park.
The old complex of the twenties, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses, among others, the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anguish is increasingly taking hold of WikiLeaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind it is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is reportedly detained in England.
The Wikileaks platform of revelations is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently searching for an Internet homeland in Europe.
Well-known U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks ejected from Amazon server."
“Speak freely in the land of freedom,” the revelation activists communicated via the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed WikiLeaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon service website in publishing secret diplomatic documents in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: “Perfectly, we’ll allocate our dollars to hiring people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server through WikiLeaks after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman requested investigations, CNN reported on a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the Guardian reported.
“I had wished that Amazon would take these steps before, before previous publications of classified information through WikiLeaks,” he said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban the use of the server in other countries.
"WikiLeaks' illegal, monstrous and disregarded process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," the statement said.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has consistently labeled the investigation in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why they fear for Assange’s safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains unrevealed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, Arkansas’ former Republican governor Mike Huckabee said the person responsible for WikiLeaks’ revelations should be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to head of government Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should be “murdered” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange a great dispute is growing.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange called for the Secretary of State’s resignation, should she be responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage duties.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than its website.”
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy distribution director of the National Counter-Terrorism Center, has been named an exceptional commissioner, the White House said.
So Travers is responsible for developing “important structural reforms,” which are necessary in light of Wikileaks’ leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must endanger the publication of WikiLeaks.
“We have done everything we can to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are prepared to help protect them if necessary.”
The University of Ice Cream
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice creams are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream come from?
Of the ice cream and of the ice cream.
The ice cream maker makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice cream.
The ice creamer takes the cream from the ice cream counter with a spatula, spreads it over the barrel and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special plus-day courses on chocolate ice cream and internships at the ice cream shop in the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an upsetting job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Ice master Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why each ball has something romantic."
The first step to elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then cools it to four degrees.
Then open the machine tap and a basic white pasteurized cream comes out, the base for all kinds of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without an estalizer?
How can you unleash some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that you disregard the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream "not just natural ingredients", perhaps has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, from guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite an ice cream sound of granite.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of the ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to pour flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"However, you must ever experience it."
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Course participants can now use the freezers.
Luciano allows them to produce four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They do the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream as well.
That you taste better doesn’t necessarily depend on having more toffee scent or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to taste nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the flavor of the ice cream, Luciano says.
Making ice cream is an artimatic problem: Peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar proportion of the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
Not only does the tool for the automatic processing of the basic dough help.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to under-zero temperature.
In spite of all, all automation is left out as far as the small pasta is concerned.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his peers from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if he were an uncontrolled giant miniprimer.
“In all the courses,” says Master Luciano, “it is only a matter of time that something like this happens.”
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry that experiments with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been hired for years at the Ilsi association.
Consortiums such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to Efsa’s testing standards for genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the deed of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interest.
So, recently, a high-ranking manager at Efsa went without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and she has changed her side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the General Environment Office as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided that they are of high technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the commission of Lobby.
On this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how are they going to be found?" he asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck is of the same opinion.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a rule.
“Industry controls security research,” Hilbeck maintains.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on his back.
There were demonstrations
- Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to tear down a large chunk of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart has never been the same again: Thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was debris.
It rotates in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He excites himself: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tübingen in a former ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He has bought everything that comes from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or send it to the dump," he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the downing company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downing.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
Around 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilo hammer cut, with a price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the rest long ago sold out.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could take in the trunk and on top of it.
The Stuttgart stone of momentum has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“Actually this stone is nothing special,” Rongen says.
"If it weren't for the political component."
Climb your SUV, take a tour of its great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and eventually worked with stones.
She is a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the largest dealer of ancient stones in the country.
Brake. Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstone stones chopped.
“They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge,” he explains.
Caliza dawn, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
It points out a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Nice travertine."
Formerly the Mazes belonged to the tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police station, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tuff from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple rig and a cart, he feels very devoted.
“It would be a scandal if something were destroyed.”
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to make the stone dealer, in addition to stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a stained glass window and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man who takes care of the remains.
Soon you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Talent struggle around great potentials
There is an active influx at the buffet.
16 students gather around buns, tomato soup and sweets.
Braunschweig Technical University and car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Competing and in the same way, many companies, like VW, come together in a close-up fight around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: to hire the most talented students of universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And because universities don’t provide publications about their students’ skills, they try to glimpse exceptional talents into practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, rubbers and folders with the VW logo.
It explains to the excited young talents the internship programs and jobs for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
It sees advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
“In turn, VW can meet students, look more closely at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
“The main point before was technical projects,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not, they have to be advertised and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacancies in October.
And, according to the forecasts of the VDI, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the auditing and consulting company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for the talent hunt.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern Yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe the KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the crème de la crème from many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple journey alone was short."
For the Dykta headhunter the notes give results.
“So far we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants.”
“Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized companies, classic with their work fairs.
"We try to get students at the specialized fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, staff manager for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently there are 35 vacancies on the company's website.
“It’s becoming very difficult to fill vacant positions.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that you can do internships with us or carry out your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, plain hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium can’t normally offer it,” says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child care or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the preconditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in her classification by her aspiring workers.
“I think the applicant is particularly focused on the external rankings of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy to gain a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Employer Branding internal, also promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a forceful ban and thereby overturned its previous plans in an unavoidable manner.
Also off the Atlantic coast there are new drill holes sealed for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What triggered this strict ban, which will be in effect for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the oil rig "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce the dependence of the United States on new oil supplies from abroad.
Until today, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable oil spill in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium following the explosion.
Subsequently, different peteroler consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe using tougher controls and tighter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible supervisory authority, which, after being charged with corruption charges, has fallen into disrepute, is undergoing a fundamental reform.
In parallel, Obama announces that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current poll conducted by consulting firm BDO - ahead of Wednesday's mining ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: “No one knows exactly what changes with regulation.”
Investments in new extraction projects are prolonged for the time being, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water from the rivers is marron oil, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude oil spills have shattered nature in Nigerian Ogonilandia.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine.
“Don’t get tired,” the environmental activist reassures journalists: “Enough oil will pass before your eyes today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to his chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost pretty.
It is not seen that brown oil spots float on the surface.
Previously, she caught shrimp by hand, Esther Badom explains on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland through a broken pipeline.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogonilandia, is considered to be one of the world’s most polluted regions.
On the path of the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat’s engine removes a brown broth, which dips its hand in the water, will take out some full of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the colliding palms and hanging their palms.
In vain flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier from the outside is shut, a kind of ghostly calm of an earlier paradise with the smell of a gas station expands in it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison proceeds.
The Ogoni settlement zone has been a battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today the return of the companies to Ogonilandia is prohibited: While they pumped daily more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogonilandia were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters steel platforms stood out like strange water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drillers.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, then a steady jet of oil flows into the water.
According to expert assessments, more than two billion liters have been dumped in 50 years in the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the failure of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil theft are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, ecologists see heads on the verge of breaking and leaking pipes as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world conventional ones, scientist Richard Steiner blamed the consortium in 2008: Only pipeline defect rates are "on a multiple higher than elsewhere."
In a place, which seems forgotten from afar, appears a workshop full of oil under free skies, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Between one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire flames: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil heats up on the fire more hours, explains Michael, the group's head.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally diesel exits.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: “Give us 34,000 naira”, around $22.
Delta residents take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euro-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from “the bunkers,” who tricked the pipeline network that runs through Ogonilandia: According to experts, at this step, at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only an insignificant portion of the stored provisional raw material is clearly refined illegally: The organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and senior military officials, keep the best part in tanks and sell it cheaply on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or the loose way of production.
“If the oil companies did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the fish’s natural habitat, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the Ogoni are mostly shattered by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like China."
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular Ölmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the army special unit catches the illegal refiners, they do not threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This damned invention has completely shattered our country,” Akpobari said.
Investigators detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
The A380 appears to have a major safety issue.
In an investigation of a machine that performed a forced landing, researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "catastrophic engine failure."
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The Qantas Airbus passengers who made an emergency landing in early November were far luckier than you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived through their investigations a major safety issue in the engines of some A380s, and warned of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: A cuff connection can cause fatigue cracks or cracks, ATSB officials announced in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline begins legal proceedings against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the Sydney federal court that allowed for further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline would claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will conduct further safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman for ATSB.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines held approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-decked aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada all over the country causes chaos in traffic
Totally white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed almost all over the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Most of the country reached freezing temperatures during Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snow removers are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong wind gusts sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects live tides with water levels 1.2 meters above their usual level on the Schleswig-Holstein Baltic Sea coast.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsische Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partly 30 centimeters of newly fallen snow and cold, strong winds are responsible for winding it.
There were many trucks and cars trapped overnight.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported major street disturbances.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, trees falling on the lanes or the broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service attended to the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, winds with snow caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokeswoman for Fraport, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The snow removers are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
In many streets, there were already many accidents on Wednesday afternoon.
In the afternoon a trucker died in a collision with a train at a track crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg because of the snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle was landed.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the journey from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overturning her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become softer and dust-like and will therefore swirl in soft gusts.
But the wind will diminish.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for buyers for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank recently arranged its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in the banking district of Frankfurt; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the revival, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then re-rent them," he said.
That’s why Germany’s largest credit institution resigns its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor in a fund of the house and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached figures of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed currently, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourn dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because the security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
Twenty-nine miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced to the site of misfortune, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Currently family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the dazzling brightness of the sun at Greymouth on New Zealand’s southern island.
They remain silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal belongings, under clothing and surfboards.
The flags waved at half-stakes in front of the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand government president John Key told participants in the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He can't take on the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, the scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to fall, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does the gore fit into artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn once again explores the boundaries of the genre with his battle epic Walhalla Rising.
What audience would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his enemies with near-superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and tear out his enemies' guts from their bodies alive when in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as he is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters let themselves be carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of grievous deadly screams.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which behind the scenes offer the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a movie has multiple groups of recipients, it’s a shame they can’t rule out each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the drug-dealing hairstyle "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works be for all audiences with a bit more humour in the mainstream or something less brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and bursting guts cannot deter most of the fans of artistic cinema.
Most fans of the action are dying of boredom, if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shuts up there again.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, hides a piece of film sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn counts just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy trance soundtrack make him a knot in his throat, especially the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a little blonde young man, who faithfully supports Unojo, preserves something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth movements
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
At least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria at midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that emerges from the river.
According to information from the US International Intelligence Service of the CIA in late April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the nearby el-Kibar very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves other purposes than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from the inside.
It had been a short time since the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely better known than then, the riddles grew bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack the CIA was totally certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but that it barely saw any indication that there was a “nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several Secret Service agents prefer to be even more prudent and only talk about an “supposed reactor,” although they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible.”
They lack solid evidence, as is the IAEA.
Asked how safe it was to have a reactor ahead, a senior U.N. diplomat replied in the summer that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions.”
The Syrians disposed very quickly of the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and cleared the ground to their conscience.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial sellers in the moments just after the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always implied that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after analysis of the particles.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss it, just as it has with regard to satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are forbidden a second inspection in el-Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel is also very silent.
"We will never comment on it," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not given results since June 2008 and "progressively becomes a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which the IAEA watches over, is finally pending.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have not yet made public what teams are being dealt with, what functions they have, or whether they appear to be suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interns, again derived from the vicinity of the situated cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with the satellite images, which are most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located at or immediately next to a military base, Syria therefore prohibits entry to all three IAEA sites.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians fear a record that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert to the equipment thanks to warnings from the U.S. Secret Service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three sites and the bucket to the banks of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production."
But there is “no indication of sensitive activities,” nor of uranium enrichment or refurbishment; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with unenriched uranium.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
Nor is there any doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of truck loads disappeared from the ground, no one has any information about where the debris remains.
The IAEA considers it unlikely that the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometers of the river Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its abilities as a zone for radioactive waste will be used.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that the Syrians carried out land movements at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it barely helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months developing an inspection plan there, which the Syrians allowed, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador fencing so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
IAEA director Yukiya Amano, who should propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitating.
This path is very risky: This requires a majority of the IAEA governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat reflected: "What if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie began in the summer with the direction of her still nameless debut.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women’s associations protested quickly, and at the last moment they moved some planned shooting days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
No love stories are given in the rape camps, and Jolie’s position on it tells victims enough about the script.
Her organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended dismissing Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian ministry of culture that read the script, granted after a strip and loosens a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go despite everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she inserts herself with much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, she wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains inaccurate.
The lovers were together before the start of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim falls in love with torturer".
It is certain that Jolie’s film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon is finally good again for the Irish.
No trace of sorrow
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans shout with joy as the loud music rumbles, hitting the floor with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in South Ireland's Cork, because players throw themselves, and find, ping pong balls to beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this strange drinking game and the discreet computer doesn’t actually make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with it, to be distracted from the fulminant question, what the future will hold.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will hold a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a shot he got the job of his dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in London.
Young people leave: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, economic experts and Dublin’s ESRI social research institute predict.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 emigrants.
A huge loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migratory wave comparable to that suffered the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, nowadays melancholy is spreading.
The economic crisis confuses above all the young, well-trained Irish, for whom so far everything is uphill.
The loss of jobs and the social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, complaining that: "In Ireland everything goes down."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, will go and lose our country and with it an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students’ Union, sees a grim future appear because the government is only engaged in montages and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategies for new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
Observe how your peers go from one practice to the next.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
“This idea is sad and depressing.”
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
“For those who start to work, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career,” says the manager.
On his website there are pictures of a boy surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it at the galleys, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan knows what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish construction colleagues in Germany.
Now they are setting up a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hanover or Berlin, for the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to pay a loan for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a little crazy,” he says, as he has long since stepped on the threshold of his home.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I’m never so good.”
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer doesn’t like the complaints he often hears today.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is by far not as dramatic as in past times here on the island,” he says.
“Working a season abroad isn’t the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel like Irish for the first time.”
He laughs and tells of his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future behind and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's already worked in London for a couple of years, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But nowadays there is one thing that worries him so much: celebrating his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he might degenerate into a farewell party.
“Only, not too many emotions,” he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Farewell, it sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a walking party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private companies.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it makes it possible to track changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor reigning in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Figure 3).
Around 34 per cent said they trusted their country’s Congress and 45 per cent their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it continued during the global financial crisis is likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and has declined again this year, to 32 per cent.)
However, mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
Such sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see chart 5).
Around 31 per cent say they or a close relative have been a victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has dropped from 38 per cent last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (see Figure 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela say the same (and 80% support private companies), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the Garbage
No one expected the general election in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
However, they went much worse than the foreigners feared trying to help the country get back on track after its problems.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted several times, ballots were thrown in the sewers, polling stations were destroyed and acts of intimidation.
The polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the election.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, declared that they were "relatively good elections in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the outgoing unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tie-off is expected to take place in January.
All hope for the elections has not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition calling for the voting to be invalidated.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has hardly any support, if he has any, has moved to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic ravages the country and more than one million earthquake survivors continue to live in tents, a large abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 identity documents needed to vote had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has become clear, Haitians themselves think so too.
Moving tipwise to the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public, which has increased its popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level it has recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite all this, it will depend on whether the clearly affected Ms. Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Ms. Fernández’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner’s death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some disagreeing members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Ms. Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
The 2010 budget, accordingly, will be implemented next year, giving the Chairperson even more room for action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, put it close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had INDEC, the statistical institute, adjust official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now moderate these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the unions.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms. Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it appears that Ms. Fernández is about to enter into an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not involve IMF oversight, as is usual.
Last month, however, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to elaborate a new index of prices for domestic consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the cleanup of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when her term ends, considering that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If she wants to win other elections, she will have to decide whether or not to calmly repudiate many of her husband’s policies.
Half Hurra for China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about his big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, came on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councilors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become an advocate of sentiments across the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest changes in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has leaned towards full independence from Taiwan, won virtually 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidentials, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of votes has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the town halls.
In the elections you could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with banners and light girls in dancing clothes.
Nor did the mysterious assassination attempt lack rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of KMT honorary president Lien Chan, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PPD leader, the shooting affected the election, sowing suspicion about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not dealt with.
Instead, candidates talked about public housing and job creation plans.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China’s military threat.
Consequently, the KMT often avoids publicizing its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time also the PPD avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma claimed that his policy with regard to China had been confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
It is best to wait until the 2012 presidential elections pass.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PDP candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to show that he can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PDP and China, as long as negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “reliable alternative” to Mr. Ma’s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he claimed that PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to run for the presidential election.
Even without Mr. Chen interceding, the PPD will have difficulty choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT should also do a conscientious examination.
Mr. Ma’s ratings have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will restructure his cabinet as well as local teams.
Large samples from the PPD suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, “the point of no return has already crossed.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the Revelation Artist category.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of this year’s Grammy surprises with a high-level nomination for Best Revelation Artist.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since her 2008 album "Hope", the nomination is thought-provoking, but respects Grammy rules that an artist must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
Their ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" undoubtedly meant a breakthrough and, considering its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as great skill with pop, funk and Latin rhythm influences, you can at least make a distinction between Spalding and Norah Jones' path to success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have lately focused on the field.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity,” an exciting and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a fierce favorite in New Orleans and a regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, which for the rest leans considerably towards fusion as on the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society earned a well-deserved recognition in the big-group category, competing against the Billy Childs Ensemble's great chamber jazz and the ever-risking Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Direction of Classic Albums
Classical music nominations for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, five movements, and Steve Mackey for "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic three movement orchestra.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his No. 4 symphony, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and released at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories spanning orchestra, opera, choral and solo albums.
The Classic Producer of the Year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Orchestra Royal Concertgebouw; Daugherty for artists "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium of the Art" of the Orchestra.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and Marilisky
Grammy-nominated composers for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for Avi Avital, who played the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the category of orchestra performance, for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets approval from the ordination commission
The mosque project for Temecula has gained unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and jams.
However, members of the commission decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha'is, of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud of it."
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
"Only they speak very loudly."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted nearly until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people interceding for or against the center, nearly the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“America no longer exists,” reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Freedom dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near the Zero Zone, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has lived seamlessly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe poses the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that there are possible life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic."
“That makes it very peculiar, though it’s little short of a truly ‘alien’ way of life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in Thursday’s online edition of Science.
There have long been considered to be six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, given that researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
"What the discovery shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of 'standard' elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be as fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is novel because it demonstrates the replacement of one element by another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s institute of astrobiology, who led the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has elevated levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could substitute one for the other.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.”
"As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
“However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it goes in and, to put it somehow, strains the biochemical machinery,” Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that there can naturally exist a way of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an auxiliary professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of replacing arsenic with phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found to prove it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early eras of Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The missing dogs have been found in Compton.
The two missing dogs have been found outside the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Officers said Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which they were spending the night in front of Bellflower Motel 6, officials said.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met late Wednesday night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
“They have returned to their rightful owners.”
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
“An investigation is underway.”
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
“We’re following some clues.”
The dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not been damaged.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit at local competitions this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were to be shown in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the virtually two-month tour of the couple participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer cub, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany) who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the car theft Tuesday at 6 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, as MGM's restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to clear about $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and TV shows.
Thursday’s ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to relaunch under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a small study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In reality, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicated the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and bankruptcy recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial hardships and satisfy the study’s more than 140 creditors, took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion the creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially goes bankrupt in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive billions of dollars in bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been raising $375,000 per month for their company's management services, will receive a "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production on MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit," along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to make a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in a deal.
Tech Toys Wants to Keep Your Gift Budget Balanced
While the iPad is the top candidate to be this year’s most wonderful toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes of $99 each, and one Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently I visited three national toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us and BJ’s Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys you could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year’s.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And toys powered by button batteries are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and up) are teddy-sized guinea pig toys that sing a note when they tighten their bellies.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to assemble a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once it begins to squeeze, it cannot stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and up) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-shifting games like Simón Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative wheeled articulated feet with locking device.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, though his parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you are a boy from the 80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and up), with a backpack full of question letters designed to turn a ride in a car into a session with a dazzling self-correcting exercise notebook.
If you are suspicious of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, ages 3 to 12), it is the first major upgrade of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and up) is a game of five blocks barely larger than a box of matches, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to arm words by putting the blocks in a row before time runs out; it’s formidable for an improvised word-arming competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than your toothbrush bristle, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and up) is the latest in a line of button-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin made his way into a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the corpulent police officers of the urban order of China, feared and despised for their whimsical energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Sign up!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "How beautiful the girls are!"
Four girls who barely went through adolescence wearing white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and tight pants to get attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
“Personally, I think they have a normal appearance,” Mr. Tang said, dismissively.
"The models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color of the uniforms to a purportedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating looks: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a disco snack cart, and watched it with a frown constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, expressly elected by their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough police a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s minimal respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from Hubei Province beat a passer-by to death after using his cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the internet, describing how to effectively whip criminals without causing them to bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street vendor suffered brain damage after a quarrel with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, introduces Chinese-trained inspectors who attack street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar on the government,” lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded “really meticulous cleaning.”
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district solicited eight new female recruits through a notice in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure “and the five harmonious facial features.”
They should be above average height, more than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too arduous for women over the age of 25.
“Your image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial traits, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
The female chengguan are like vases, she said, adding, "in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to back that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job advertisements for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not appear.
“We cannot allow a person to catch or a humpback to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his colored cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His dimple co-worker, Xu Yang, 21, said “Our work must present the image of the city.”
They also don’t oppose their fixed-time work, they said, because they harbor higher career ambitions than simply driving salespeople away in the alleys where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces roughly a dozen street vendors who throw themselves off on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many tofu buns or bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We have told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn carriage with noodle trims.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is roughly the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare time.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, mutined after the false rumor spread that some Chengguan officers had killed a vendor.
More than a dozen police officers or Chengguan officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
At the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
The calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle screamed rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, made way for the elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with his white badge turned over to hide his name.
As female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught how to maintain an elegant image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said naturally.
“Most of the time it’s the audience who starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not bring charges against Senator Ensign
The senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have excused Senator John Ensign from criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said it was "certainly pleased" with the decision, which came after a full-year investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plans to bring charges against him on this matter."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
The interviews, email and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, obtain lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve silence for Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks to its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to drop the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, amid procedural misconduct charges.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s top lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
“I’m not comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we thought they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got work through lobbying thanks to Ensign’s help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "scraping" the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator expected the ethics committee to quickly follow the Justice Department’s lead and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign wishes to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the appalling testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the largely-followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, is set to reach an official end, with the imposition of the death penalty judge voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have filed court papers outlining the arguments of appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports about the process, including widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “an atmosphere of circus,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“Based on what I experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual’s rights to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, senior defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
Trial judge Jon C. Blue of the State High Court laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying that the news media were “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was led by the passion.
But it will probably not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeals courts have recognized that celebrity case coverage can raise questions about the impartiality of a lawsuit.
In a historic 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his ruling, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the way of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media” on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford School of Law, who studied Connecticut’s death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the issues outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes may have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury members, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process may attract most of the interest.
They noted in a rejection of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually threw firewood into the fire of excitement over the case.
“The daily crowding of tweets from the media, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state.”
His attention to Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly was a ludicrous view that would make the court’s policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said appeals courts were often drawn to arguments about the adaptation that was required in courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their letter, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which revokes Dr. Sheppard’s conviction due to the coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media would require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century.”
Can civicism build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, this week has unleashed a bit of civicism in Washington.
Is it a foreshadowing of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a swift return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But as they all say, it was at least a courteous discussion about the differences of the two sides, as well as an acknowledgment of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another empty episode to earn partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit commission was equally civilized, despite political differences remaining among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Now both sides are in a trial period, probe each other to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent evaluations of it by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too great and too deeply rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed with respect to how things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections awaken partisan passions, which then become extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Likewise, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make them believe they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s White House meeting, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
“After the things that need to be done are done, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontational one,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises of cutting state spending and overturning the new health law.
Those partisan lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include reform of the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting expenditures.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, forcibly introduced the issue of deficit to the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for compromise on fiscal issues.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans in the White House and those in Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and medical care, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would the change bring about?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the bias of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as it happened in 1995, then both parties will watch carefully the reaction of the people.
Whoever they think is losing will likely change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a “cleptocracy,” leaving a portion of the bribes and protection money that it collects directly from the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service are handling huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called “vertical authority,” takes its share as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of cleansing since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have systematically denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when he was asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said: “It’s madness, it’s a scam, it’s an annoyance.”
According to the polls, the Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, since they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
“The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional’, and to claim that the government functions more as a kleptocracy than as a government,” the statement said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term from the criminal and mafia world that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the office of the prosecutor, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
Analysts identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
“The SFS, the MVD and the militia are at the second level.”
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow commercial owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats,” Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, said in a recent interview.
“But he’s a part of this bureaucracy.”
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154 (countries are ranked from the least to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy’s note, which did not happen until late in the evening Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that claimed U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge government, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations-Cambodia mixed court issued the first sentence of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentenced the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among former Khmer Rouge, but they can do nothing,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.
“This is creating divisions within families.”
During the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, illness or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of Western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting the trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Khmer Rouge elite officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the low-level soldiers remain poor and unqualified farmers.
“These people have gotten few benefits after the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime.”
"They were raised without any concept of doing business."
Sr. Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine,” he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone food."
“But now life is difficult because we have to self-sufficiency.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute the top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve much to soothe fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told investigators at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are believed to have died.
During a recent shameful afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden piles on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She said that if the court called her, she would not appear.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is precisely what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
“Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces,” he said.
“It is our duty to gather these broken pieces together so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little detail about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's link to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they are not sure about how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a pathway with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a black soot rectangle covered by an oxidized tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone seller on the roadside, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
“But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him,” he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last break, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of qualified uranium for armaments
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will give up its reserve of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the past two months, to remove 84.82 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday’s deal to remove the rest of the material, roughly 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke anonymously due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation nuclear security summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was apparently a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This shows that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have retained the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-grade uranium) and the low-enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material ... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been lightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the low-enrichment uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that “this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen confidence” that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential relaxation.
“While the progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.”
The Spanish government did not reply to the CIA flights
The Spanish government has not objected to the CIA’s flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading to Guantanamo by Spanish territory, the US ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercise appropriate surveillance over foreign planes passing through Spain."
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in anti-human rights practices, there was a meeting between former U.S. ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken Zapatero's government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no reservations about intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "stacked unsuspectingly," Aguirre recounts on a cable.
The then foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited ability to influence".
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez told the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern about “apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors,” rather than declassified information from the CNI or the defense ministry.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter told him that "although the Spanish judges are rabiously jealous of their independence and will do whatever they deem appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP’s performance in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these disclosures have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” he said.
The confessed parricide complained in the network of the "overwhelming" of being a mother
The young woman talked about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she used from a young age, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the Coru<0xC3><0xB1>ean people of which she was born.
The messages are from 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician, 30, started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tú<0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get a DNA test.
He soon met another girlfriend.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even came to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance was broken, they broke up.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and flirtatious, because I have come to work."
“When I told him it seemed good to him, but of course, now he realizes what it’s like to be with the child all day and not be free to do whatever he wants.”
Then, say a message to the phone you just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you to the child."
She complains, “If she doesn’t like me leaving the child with my mother, I’ll pick him up when he comes back,” she says.
In May, he talks about returning to his village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to be until the 19th, because the 20th I have to introduce myself to a job so I don't lose it."
He clarifies that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
“He’s going to be with whoever he should be, that is, with me, and I’ll never in life think of leaving him with anyone but my mother again,” he said.
In July, there is another post.
When you type it, the boy, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly killed on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
He talks about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (the boy) to some summer classes, and so I save a little kangaroo paste."
The 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says that he sent you I don't know what videos to email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck me."
The 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes so that he learns Catalan."
Of Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's getting me money ahead."
On the internet there are messages on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he called himself "Muki the Ex-Prisoner."
"Terror the Galician (heading). "
The last man who lived with her, a juror guard, declares his sorrow for feeling guilty.
She doesn’t want to believe that everything happened because she didn’t tell her that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma, from the Menorca Judicial Detainee Center.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "nor did he intend to cause any harm to the child."
He confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and placed his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has a view on the general elections because, whether advance or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in these elections usually doubles that it receives in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 regional elections the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the CPP won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, is maintained, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if there were general elections, the CPP could increase from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a deputy - now has three - while ICV would stay with a deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relay to the head of the Diputación de Barcelona, one of the administrations that handles the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popularists agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority or the possibility to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be crazy that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can lead the overthrow in the capital of Tarracon, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has been placed only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three detainees in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by police officers of the Police General Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last author of the attacks in 2008.
The Interior Ministry has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the “Operation Kampai” the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda at the international level has been “weakened” and, therefore, “its operational capacity”.
The researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "fighters" can cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence in the investigations, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units have participated, so it is not ruled out that in the next days coups similar to those developed on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona will be carried out in the EU territory.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were arrested, another was developed in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistani Zebuan Khutan and the Pakistani At Buthar Muhammad
These were the ones who led the cell settled in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole tourists passports that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents must be in the name of males between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
According to the media, no data has been found to link those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, Laskar e Taiba, was one of the recipient groups of the stolen passports in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency some 1,000 dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
The PP demands more to park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispensing with philosophical-sovereignist adventures, as is the economic concert that the national leader wants.
The president of the popular Catalans attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the assurance that he has obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make himself wanted, because the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the investiture vote.
From a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when the general elections are held, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an inauguration "will have to park all the sovereignist and independence speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends to even submit to a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to thin the political apparatus of a heavily inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax on inheritances and donations.
The details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with by the CPP, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their guard killed more than 11 elders
The officials of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the harm that has caused to the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there employed killed at least eleven elderly who had in his care.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, lawyer Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the charge against the responsible person" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
In addition to the social disrepute that the entity may suffer for not detecting the criminal activities of the guard in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has since continued to kill.
The judge already pointed out in the indictment ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - who suspected that in many cases no doctor was personally exploring the deceased but that, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, strongly denied this extreme yesterday, noting that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what has happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is not a single indication in the case that there has been reckless action on the part of anyone other than the accused himself."
The former "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders yesterday and said the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case he caused his death by pricking an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that he committed using a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat notes that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to the medicines.
Insulin punctures and the cocktail of sedatives would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes the nurse, in his quest to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila is not lying and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed he did with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the guard, nor even to the number of murders confessed, which do not rule out being higher, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, with success, eight murders.
That is why they say they are making themselves available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB is threatening
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet’s threat that he warned “markets should not underestimate our reactivity.”
Peripheral spreads have closed tightly and European bank shares have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely picked up, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses recovers but is motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take time to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and they will have to be withdrawn tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the ineffective completion of the public debt purchase plan and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the long term, leaving only unlimited weekly access.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend current liquidity measures “at least until March” and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond buying program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, may God help us!
As at their May meeting where they claimed they had not even contemplated buying bonds and markets collapsed, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, triggering a new market crash.
Yesterday’s one-year letter auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28%, versus 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment following Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, figures from the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still has insufficient support, so Ireland remains a focal point of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension in the face of the upcoming summit of heads of state and government on December 14, in which a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity by presenting yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four stations of Vivaldi.
The Trichet and ZP double effect explains that the Spanish stock exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been quick and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key three-year bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Aid Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available triple that in March, at very expensive rates and you close access to the markets without say.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "besides being so, appear to be so."
Move, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicily requested by his children
The storm does not diminish in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "null in full", the judicial board of El Enebro next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesús David and Maria José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over control on the part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company seems unwilling to yield in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
He was dismissed from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who were appointed directors at the shareholders’ meeting on January 18th of this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has again opened the box of thunder in the bosom of the Alvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants his five children to, through procedural cunning, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of right, try to validate and heal the radically null Junta of January 18," according to its officials.
This argument will be the basis for, once the meeting is held, to proceed to its challenge considering it to be "full nullity".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez’s seven children control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the substantive question to be decided by the judge once the hearing on the appeal is held, for which there is no date yet.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final line of the championship, everyone bet on Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari victory.
Without underestimating the driver’s skill of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that powers his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the “secret weapon” that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make him a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far from high-end motor racing.
Called PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly lines of manufacturing plants worldwide, power plants, high precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most celebrated utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has enabled Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and in trials.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on his team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
Today, the Red Bull team employs 180 young, highly qualified professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the bolides.
The Siemens CEO explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull’s cars except the engine, which is Renault’s sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation of this craziness of technological improvement is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate the competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its cars in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered “high secret.”
The staff for this task amounts to 580 people, including his two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull Formula 1 hero, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drinks brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and its notoriety is null.
Steve Nevey, head of technology at the factory, said five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in truck cars contributed 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds up to 85% of the success, while the drivers contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 stores in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will combine this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran Vía Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, including the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP Personal Systems said the philosophy for installing the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishment staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchase, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering global pilot program that is in charge of solving the possible problems of HP computers under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets to 'steal' a million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially ruled out a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in interest margins, which will be attempted to compensate in part by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to attract one million private customers in three years, its subject pending.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011, the bank will launch a new master plan that will run for three years.
The goal, in addition to surviving without resorting to public aid from FROB, is to gain market share by attracting a million new private customers -700,000 if you discount those who can leave the bank - its large pending subject, since so far it had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in private individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the plan 2011-2013 is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the year.
Few banks nowadays dare set targets and make them public as the financial crisis has upset all the plans of global banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its master plan Optima, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made it extend it one more year.
Customers who let out the savings boxes will be their main goal.
In a breakfast hosted by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a “difficult and transcendental” year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes the liabilities war — which penalizes margins — is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and cashiers are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity is already shifting to the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it is going to be a pressure factor on credit.”
“We haven’t closed the tap, but the spreads are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave orders on Thursday to its network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads - see Five Days of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the bank’s trend now “is to raise commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "greater sizes will be required."
“Next year everything will move,” he said.
He claims that the capital needs are "extremely rising" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial institution enters in red numbers.
And it points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds against new recapitalizations.
Having ensured that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it downplayed what some bankers already foretold as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, you can get short-term funding through rest, which dampens the crisis.
The ECSC ruled out a second wave of mergers in boxes
The general director of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that a wave of mergers of savings banks will occur and again insisted on the speed at which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When he started the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
“I think the biggest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments.”
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the great processes have already been done and guarded by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in that too," the director said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the process of concentration is being carried out "at the highest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is going to happen in the deadlines that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
“Going from 45 boxes with an average asset volume of 28.5 billion to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The director said that, in the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has embarked on a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking did very well in the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but has set the conditions for the entire Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or suppression of the 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of many of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany begins to speculate about the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budget strictness, fines to the transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments from some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government took a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed needed to be done (plans for fiscal rigor and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the forehead was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece’s rescue decision.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published opinion were strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding reform of the EU treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved, and in the coming months we should be attending the process of reform of the Union that will make those measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which he may not agree very much, from that date onwards the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which infringer countries will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare themselves on hold of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not tolerate it.
The enthusiasm is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater tranquility.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood it this way and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that order must be put at home has been paved the way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn’t seem to be moving.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, the possibility of leaving a monetary zone too crowded with inserious countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and Fraud Law
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos before Ajax show ingenuity but no willingness to escape a sanction.
The alleged expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Nov. 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink flows to be written about whether or not such behavior is unsporting and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the match (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time to draw fault paths to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
That way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and can pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned team coach José Mourinho with two games and with different financial amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or the like is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the reported case is because it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (who in his anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and has sometimes fined his players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds another episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit fraud by law; because, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sporting regulation, but they seem to elude its meaning.
The question is to examine the kind of harm they cause to the sportsmanship.
One of the assets that the sports spirit comprises is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these assets that fair play is alluded to is to prevent the team of the offending players from unfairly exploiting the opposing team, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradoxical thing about the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but precisely his action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders get in the intentional offences examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the opponent is not placed in a disadvantageous situation or profit is made in the same game, since obviously the result of the action involves leaving the team itself with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, since the team can be eliminated at the first change, and in addition with this performance the players meet a penalty game and move to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, from going through rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions are not against the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor to get the most out of what the rules allow.
In the present case, the players did not act to evade the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without evading the punishment or fleeing it.
Although the boundary between wit and law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of wit.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises by two factors: because it was about two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the directive to provoke them was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offers Offensive to Capture Group Christmas Dinners in BCN
The calendar dictatorship concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
The self-sustaining celebrations are proliferating by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
With the arrival of December, the group dinners pre-Christmas, which continue to exercise as an oxygen ball for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to attract the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals of the sector, the companies agree.
To end up complicating the accounting, this year’s calendar (as New Year’s Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated petitions on the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of peak-day dinner reservations (the 16th and 17th) and hardly any movement for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lean cow stage began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to dispense with the tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Barcelona Restoration Board, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the employers, to this day, does not dare to predict what the celebrations of this month will be.
"People think about it long before booking."
"He wants to leave but has the alerts on the subject of prices," he said.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and remembers that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the strip around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey of several central establishments found the collapse of requests for the night of the 17th.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real boom in applications for that Friday, with the pretense of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early reservation, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done our utmost to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
At AN Grup, which flags El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, they remain optimistic after detecting a boom in turnover from the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources in the group point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who precede the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas one, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reservations are "animated", although the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
However, the illusion for the celebrations has not descended, pay whoever pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons “at a faster rate than any other country.”
Wikileaks leaks confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns raised in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security, rather than increasing, is “decreasing,” and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program — that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack — is one of the main reasons for awakening in Washington.
The ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists it in a pre-visit report by then-National Security Adviser James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-attacked territory, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transport of atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and reason to keep guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given falling educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs," Yuri Korolev, a Russian foreign ministry expert, said at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The latest in the documentation leaked by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan’s high rate of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May called communication with Pakistan “frustrating” and said: “Transparency is often non-existent; offers of aid are either left unanswered or discarded.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence for South Asia official, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also called on Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it “very clear” to the official that “the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups.”
The hunt for WikiLeaks boss
Obama appoints a senior counter-terrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol is issuing a red alert in order to track the moves and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Interpol issued a “red alert” yesterday to “locate and follow Assange’s moves.”
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It’s not new, it’s dated November 20.
And it’s not about the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but about the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Wikileaks creator Mark Stephens’ lawyer said: “The police know where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange.”
It was on the 20th that the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not disclose it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications of identifying or locating Assange “with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called free-way network notice to proceed with an arrest -- which must be carried out by the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has been willing to respond by videoconference to questions from Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
“This seems like a hunt, not a legal pursuit,” the letter denounces.
As the world searches for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday, she granted an interview to Time magazine's director via Skype from an indefinite location, a conversation in which she asked for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy at the UN in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign,” he said.
His view was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request “ridiculous and absurd.”
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counter-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with views proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the Homeland Security Committee in the lower house from January, has called on the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to intervene and their funds and to pursue anyone who gives them any contribution or aid.”
Further has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying Assange should be “murdered.”
“Obama should make it a target and use a drone or something.”
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to the likes of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to overcome the nth internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC, without north for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his resignation is insufficient for those related to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can in no way cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will try to beat the new critics with winks that allow him to armor himself until the municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national advisors of ERC will be able to comment on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, and not by raised hand.
If the Carodians want to convey a certain vow of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of subjugation to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not be considered ratified with half plus one vote, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand more from the president than to make his office available to the militancy, a gesture that is not worthwhile when Puigcercós controls the highest body between congresses.
But since they do not have enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that management will put to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to advance the congress by autumn 2011, something that the summit already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that the “polyphony” impairs stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty rags of doors inwards.
In this line, the article that the acting consultant Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the headline of Innovació took for granted that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he lists five, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, he advocated a reform of the statutes that would allow congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, who already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the management with the task of reviewing assembly at a specific statute reform congress.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years was not advisable to deal with the matter.
Now, without critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to resume and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO Estado de México there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the contents of MILENIO Estado de México.
Among the killings were three women and the discovery of a couple of bodies in the Valle de México.
In the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases highlights that of a corpse found in San Diego of the Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunfire shots and the grace shot in the head in addition to his wired feet and hands.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street, in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the municipality of Naucalpan.
At dawn on Thursday four, ejidatarios found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the quota highway Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the section that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was killed by eight bullets after leaving his house to begin garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were finalized from a bullet impact on the head each in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the grace shot in the forehead was found the corpse of a man on a lonely road of the El Naranjo Colony and under the body they found a pierced caliber 25 firearm cap.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the sewage channel of the colony Playa Golondrina.
Emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the other body members, but were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán warned of the discovery of a corpse that was found in the place Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada, which was tied with his hands back and with his head bandaged.
The man had an injury caused by gunfire in the neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men was reported, who were wrapped in blankets and left in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda fractionation in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found lifeless in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning was located the body of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow blanket with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Ríos according to a message that his executors left with him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunfire shots in the neck, the dead body of a woman was found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman were detected tattoos of Santa Death, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, the body of a man was found aboard a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with their heads bandaged and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, “This happens to those who don’t line up.”
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied hands and feet, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the colony San Agustín.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the colony Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon ribbon and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him the agents found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and said it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Wei said that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this issue.
He noted that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including last year’s passing of a new Energy Law, which sets out the targets set for reducing gas emissions, he explained.
In China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities to achieve energy saving, energy efficient use and emission reduction goals.
In addition, various multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, were abundant, underway or have already been completed.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficient Use Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for changing incandescent spots for savers and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the country’s government on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than is generally thought.
For example, he explained, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years and expects to do another by 2020, it abounded.
Attached to legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former panist leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former panist leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what is appropriate to his right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo’s protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission of Order of Sonora."
“Mr. Espino has the right to go, if necessary, through a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the sphere of a competent body,” he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that there was never an alliance for the presidential candidacy at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional will emerge strengthened from the internal election of December 4th and 5th, in which his successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The panist leader said that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he said.
He said the council will undoubtedly know how to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence it will deliver the postage "to whomever the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the rebound that recorded the party in the last July 4 election will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are put in them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to the expectations".
When questioned about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of the four years of his government, César Nava called on the priests to reflect on the six-years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon, let them start defending them, let them get out of the closet,” he said.
He opined that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag nor much less censorship.
Obama promotes Twitter law for undocumented students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” he tweeted.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link with a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with senators, given that the vote on the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote expected to take place soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he says.
The message came after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation unless Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs hoped that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable for the rest of the projects can be set.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
“We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year.”
“I think we can make a deal at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a “debate closing vote” for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years, and have entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the participation of a handful of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations are running intense lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
For this reason, supporters of the Dream Act require several Republicans to join in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martinez's term of office.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, from Texas, but have said they will not back it another time.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where participants galaed the narrative
"That of Sex in the tongue I understand but... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of your question.
The finger on the sore... "puts us in trouble," the Argentine writer gently peeped to the public, mostly young people, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to hear this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great tale, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "laga" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she gets no answers but leads in the same narrative thread.
The infectious doctor is convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach to the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who clarifies to him that the sore is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the sore is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the sore I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must go very interwoven.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also expounded a delightful narrative that titled Praise of the invention, where the finger in the sore is not named but at one point is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress, who touched the same clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden would have lost, narrative that turned to speak later America, the great novel that was not lacking from the beginning his own chroniclers who conquered it and cited the capitals of the Castle who criticized them for the excess.
"Cervants who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that was lacking even modestly."
However, he stressed "it is the madmen and the deceivers who best imagine" and it is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that the narrated belongs to one side or another, where the fictional literature reaches its peak.
In fact, it is called the Cervantine tradition.
“By his inheritance we are what is told.”
In turn, the writer Mayra Montero summed up and applauded the variety of interpretations that resulted in the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger in the sore.
The Cuban-Puertorican woman pointed hers towards the great scourge of social violence that runs through her country - and shares Latin America - the product of the disputes of the trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit compromise that is of course not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the compromise that is established between the author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that leads to dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To own our thoughts and be masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance means many times putting a finger on the sore and annoying those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also annoying the powers who prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting himself with the medal of the sub-champion, he has been one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the Tournament Apertura 2002, when he led the reins of Morelia with which he fell by global of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Closure 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with global of 3-1 and it was precisely to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Devils, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team ended up 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the round of penalties he was put in 3-1 advantage with two chances to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4th round.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the spell and be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he claims that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an aficionado that I owe and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," the steering officer said when he asked about the numbers he has against playing finals.
“The only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were already ready to run and I think that is a teaching, until the game is over we can celebrate.”
Knowing that this series could be defined in penal shots, something that does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the round of penalties, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately something that made us a bad end, but sometimes we did not wait for the nerves or the anxiety of having the title".
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up coach and try for the first time the glory that the titles give.
I am changing the rules to get a visa.
Individuals should go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview at the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time will be lower.
As of January 10, 2011, you will change the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants will need to go to Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASCs) prior to their interview at the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases on request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section, will stay in the Consular Section less time than in the past.
Similarly, those who apply for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA to announce discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will unveil an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts, a science described as in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present “a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” prompting speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures on our side and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will unveil the true scope of the findings at tomorrow’s press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and opponent 'block' pattern
With reforms to the Congressional Organic Law, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and all four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'throned' against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it initiates ‘bipartisanism’, because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in their capacity as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that with these reforms institutionally, the political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN is constituted.
He said that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overrun again by both parties and with this the opposition coalition is over.
“So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that’s what I look at, because we’re excluded, from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, now be “duopolistic.”
“It is not the spirit of reforming the law that there is eternal bipathism in Congress.”
For starters, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other colleagues to be more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that Congress has now become a 'booty' between two, in reference to the PAN and PRI.
“Before it was just a game, now they’re dividing it between two.”
Patron Montalvo, asked that the personality of the deputy be respected, that he be given his place at the negotiating tables.
“Not by cupular agreements, let it be left out to 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, right now to the five that see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unify to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform.”
$200k more for "supplier"
Mazatlan City Council pays another check to the questioned owner of electrical equipment company.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the company of electrical equipment, amounts to 1 million 200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money would come from the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the State Higher Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and, consequently, how many more checks remain to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you're just being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter, November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official Gazette of the State, as stipulated by the Act when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not re-used its services.
The above, after July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 pesos.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urge to attend tourist sites
Tourist businessmen regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Sánchez Taboada Glorieta, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a poor image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reversed the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and benches has affected because tourists come to walk and see the mess and turn him around to nearby businesses.
“Politics don’t know what it’s like to close a company one day and they have no idea how much money is lost, or else they wouldn’t do the work in this way in such a long time and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because giving preventive maintenance and not fall only in the corrective," he said.
“We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well.”
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venadito of Mazatlan.
“Today, in order for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what the tourist attractions are,” he said.
“Not enough attention has been given and this kind of facts highlights something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of touristic vocation.
“Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered, cleaned and put online first to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination.”
Request IP Results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs should assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges it faces.
A legislature of decent and free of inter-party and state executive agreements demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature was installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 deputies from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one from the PVEM, which adds a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges it faces.
“We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to watch over their own interests and become carnival companions of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary factions.”
Hence he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that will bring the Governor in turn forward.
“We are making sure that they come to do a decent job and above all committed to society and sectors because it was the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulos who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation.”
As for the tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give it the weight it carries within the state budget to strengthen the State Secretary of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second secretariat in the state with the least budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and that it directly competes with the agribusiness."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources to tourism projects that detonate and help in giving security to the state and in updating the Alcohol Act that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
A Wizard's King is Wanted
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For her parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please her illusions, as her home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, Jose Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaiah, Jose Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and live up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Well sometimes we see it hard because my husband has no chamba, but we sell mandarin and papa ... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes sized for a year.
“He told me (José Alfredo), ‘I would like this monster,’ but I told him, ‘Let’s go see son,’ because it was so expensive,” Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of sizes five and a half or six would be of great help.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign Seeking a Wizard King, donating a toy or cash at the reception of Northwest.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out as part of the dismantling of a network of cannabis production and sale.
Fourteen people have been detained who will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face allegations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have come after a long investigation that has lasted nearly a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests," Mr Ruel said.
About seventy officers from the Estrie de la sécurité (Quebec Security) investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
It will be possible to fight illegal migration without problems
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should solve the problem of clandestine migrant-loaded paters, is likely to face great opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
"I find myself here with a party that has created the granite you are stepping on," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not support the bill because it targets the wrong target.
“We are against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing,” Duceppe said.
The NDP’s immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has blatantly rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
“The New Democrats agree that action should be taken against those in charge of smuggling and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35,” said Ms. Chow.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a mat.”
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” said Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government would ask for a vote to be held so that each deputy who is going to oppose will later explain himself to his voters.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity.
Although Jean Charest had announced the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and anti-collusion unit, many observers continued to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York is issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
So Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It should be noted that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the police services of Quebec on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for Quebec party critic dealing with public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this ad “a rabbit pulled out of the chister” and “a last-minute solution.”
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence over possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” he simply says.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ chairman Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest is stubborn in preventing the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this stalemate, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the Attorney General to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the Attorney General,” he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the inspector the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent gang is not the only project on the rise in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request appears to have come from the prosecutor for Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001 relating to the bikers ' groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa pushed for the passage of the Gangster Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Various waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a precautionary measure, they have been evacuated from their homes.
At night, another landslide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides, at Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rainfall.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters are also expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations add to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers would overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow at Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a provisional bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civilian security unit remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, according to security adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec Growth Forecasting Center, for its part, issued announcements Wednesday reporting the strong increases of several rivers, including the Maskinongé, the Assumption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partially blamed on Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Radio-television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding welfare and Haitians, as well as for their rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Council also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Common Front of People Receiving Social Assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were incorrect.
Presenters should communicate reliable data and not misleading.
In connection with the suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont had stated that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes questioned by "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Consequently, any blame has been discarded in this regard.
The last litigation concerned statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if those in need would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
“I’ve already fulfilled my three-day suspension up there.”
“My file has been clean for a year and a half,” the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio station has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of highest hearing within three days.
King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, climbs to the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance the professional level.
“In my case, I’m looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don’t enjoy playing on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security officer and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, held October 23-30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I've won in the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories," he said.
“I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shu World Cup in China.”
“They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category.”
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
“In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009.”
“The interesting thing is that I’ve been making progress in every competition.”
“At this step, I’ll be the first this time or next year!”
San Shu or Sanda is a discipline native to China in which it is allowed to beat with fists and feet, as well as throwing adversaries to the ground.
The matches are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the Vietnamese-born American Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal must only maintain one competition in his career, he will certainly attend the big tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).
“It has been an incredible experience.”
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“The one who beat me is a real professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face each other in the final of their category."

450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management contract, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition.”
“I mean, people, instead of doing it secretly, now openly do it,” Quebec Party deputy Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he says he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that collusion had occurred with this contract.
“I’m starting to get tired,” he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted “dishonestly” and “with a lack of rigor.”
He said the “minimum” would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of the consortiums is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract was awarded without competition; it was a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of the consortiums in the technical advisory sector is undergoing an investigation by the Government.
A quick look at the Quebec trade register allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which appear permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, i.e. Dessau.
Regarding the Energy Gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular workforce dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
“If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher.”
“You have two options: you can contact the players in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory deal and at a good price.”
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people," Mr Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amounted to $449,783,344, including the Managing Energy contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well-known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is rather their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The label "green" does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer in Quebec has little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade brands or ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, the first results of which were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumption are overflowing, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this even slows their commitment.
Even though consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates bearing so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "eco-responsible," the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about a third of consumers in Quebec.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of information cause 46% of consumers to deny this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of the alleged yields of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points out of a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the king of recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be on the doorstep (of their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Société Angus and the Parallele, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallele, who were expecting a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematic complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and restore his true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they were asking for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would in fact be lower than original expectations; this could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, forwarded a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report about a decade ago.
However, the SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallele and Angus have a deadline until December 31 to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a state donation must be completely discarded.
It should be recalled that the Quebec Association of Cinema and Film Complex Owners opposed direct State investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various representatives of the sector do demand considerable economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has been carrying the burden of the author's cinema on its premises for ten years, after financing its own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The company Angus and el Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, are launching a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to make their way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallele, continues to show films on eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three halls on February 27th, screening Xavier Beauvois’s beautiful film “Des hommes et des godux”.
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downside proposals they have received.
The veil of complex Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the complex of Canadians over Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter’s feeling of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they’re going to vote and believe President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable of September 22, 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused a great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gives some explanations about this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex practically inherent to Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign), "he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this choice: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“The ability of a candidate, a party, and even more so the leader of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting.”
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the government’s survival during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will first register deficits over the past decade due to a $30-40 billion recovery plan,” writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington of the increasingly negative image broadcast by the drama series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issuance of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but that it depended "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, “has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in connection with Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent.”
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that moods have warmed in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered."
In the United States, there is an echo of Mike Huckabee.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount that corresponds to virtually a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of specific major projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, are replaced by fluorescent compact bulbs or, better still, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or “LED”), much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided to illuminate them.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the global fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that amount should be further decreased to stabilize, before 2020, the rise in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluorescent light bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, the energy consumption is further reduced twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
They do not contain any mercury.
A number of experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent light bulbs, as they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report notes, the main source of mercury emission on the planet are not fluorocompact bulbs, but coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits of this international programme for each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it $2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire eagerly awaiting announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the “immediate” publication of the results of the presidential elections in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire, given that the deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,” a spokesman for the UN chief said.
Calls on all parties in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed Wednesday’s deadline to be passed at midnight without the results being published, three days after Sunday’s poll.
About forty minutes before the deadline ended, the president of the CIS had commented on television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
However, Gbagbo’s side has the constitutional council annulling the “fraudulent” votes in the north, in the hands of the former New Forces (NF) rebellion since the failed coup d’état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the president of Ivory Coast, has said that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters carried out by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the outgoing president's followers from going to vote.
The entire election could be voided if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints made by Gbagbo.
Now, Gbagbo’s adversaries consider the country’s highest court not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday should have set the stage for the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remains stable in third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% in continental territory (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by data corrected by the provisional seasonal variations (CVEs) published on Thursday by the INSEE.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The second quarter data have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population in continental territory and 9.7% with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available within two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in a year), 25% including the DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points both in three months and in one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only stable unemployment among people aged between 25 and 49 years has been recorded, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne General Council, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking of influences and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before the appearance of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night, they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their closest people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done is take care of the landfills he must manage.
As for the allocation of the contracts or the purpose of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to the lawyer Simon.
As part of this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, is also being investigated since Wednesday for embezzlement of funds and complicity, but he has been released on probation and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached him."
“The magistrate instructor has taken into account the explanations and has released him,” his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, explained.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, four other people were questioned and released, under judicial scrutiny in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of property at Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been charged with “trafficking influences and passive corruption.”
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "subtraction and misappropriation of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and for "compliance in the misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “covering up the abuse of social property.”
Among those who have faced Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect that their societies have service to whitewash the capital of great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial orders initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that the investigations focus especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: The Elisha has exaggerated Syria mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French investigator detained in Iran for "espionage", has been vilified by the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elisha has explained his strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice on managing their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not come in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by U.S. justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the grim reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
The Elysée’s strategic adviser, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own forcibly detained citizens in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continuously release” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocent,” “immediate release.”
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often.”
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discreet channels are exhausted, “the silence will not solve anything,” the Iranians are “experts in delaying maneuvers.”
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is “a usual Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money" (€230,000 reward).
In addition, he notes that the Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge’s decision.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iranian clandestine nuclear procurement networks, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept an exchange?
To liberate the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that it was not.
The Elisha, he says, has not only “been greatly surprised by the judge’s decision,” but has tried to oppose it.
“There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice” (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot overturn the decision,” the court said.
Mr. Richier also wants to prove that Majid Kakavand is still under the “close” surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysee adviser dials a phone number, hangs and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elisabeth spares no effort, uses press releases and organized “leaks” in the media to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an “important” and “influential” role as “mediator.”
Americans observe this activity with some irony and find that manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles broadcast the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media flash of French officials".
What is the reason for such “gratitude” towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
Next, the document deals with the reasons that have led Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The major communication effort “is aimed at validating Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
A policy begun in 2008 that "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, it had just been labeled premature and unearned."
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris attempts to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “seed the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier entrusted him: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
“But anyway, we thanked him.”
“At least, this should cause confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Eliseo.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an “active role in favor of the release of our compatriot.”
From midnight, young Koreans cannot play online
The South Korean government will pass a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teenagers from engaging in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament asking online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under 16 years of age, representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family have indicated.
“Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day.”
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” said AFP Jo Rin, ministerial head of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games when the youngsters’ parents so request, the official added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced another 58 countries.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA appoints host countries
In the midst of the storm sparked by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday appoints the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can come to take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue with its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities from the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Backstage transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) bids have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of their country, the cradle of football, which only once hosted the World Cup in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the bonfire on Monday as it aired a documentary that has exposed three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who have been thrown into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The head of government hopes to remake the successful coup given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the Olympic Games 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to regain England's brilliance before the EC?
It is not clear, since the duo Spain-Portugal also has numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the grim economic and financial outlook of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal the only thing they manage is to give points to Russia, turned into a heavy outsider despite the gaps in his candidacy (stadions, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in direct reference to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“They’re pulling out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the 1994 experience, seems to be the most logical favorites.
As the world’s leading economic powerhouse and home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the concession of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of chance by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by weak TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second Mandate: The Proof
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had implied that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that he doubts.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in autumn 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the deputies of the UMP, on Tuesday night at the Eliseo, the possibility of "two terms" has provoked some upheaval.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not at all.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He simply conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has spoken about the presidential elections, in a joking tone, in meetings of this type.
"In the worst, or better, of cases, you're still going to spend seven and a half years with me," he said.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about what's coming next."
His assertions of the previous day do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
There are comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has come to the talk that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather the opposite; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to demand that the battle be organized earlier than planned.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
“We have a candidate and at the UMP there is no discussion on the issue,” the Prime Minister’s environment immediately and prudently reacted.
“If you think you can lose, you won’t be a candidate,” said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“He will always think he can win,” says Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB is forced to keep its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should be completed by the end of the year.
Due to the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so perennial if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation in the European bond markets today.
The political cost would be equally high.
During a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde backed the ECB’s active role in resolving the European states’ debt crisis.
He did not mean whether he felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its program of buying state bonds.
“I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans.”
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show more eloquent about his intentions, only indicating that the program for buying State Letters in the secondary market was "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will keep its main unchanged rate at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have bought again Irish and Portuguese bonds.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired EUR 67 billion in securities since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in course.
Although more than three-month loan operations have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial conditions and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect today this device to be extended for a few months.
"I don't think he's going to make any significant changes to his program."
“Otherwise, I would run the risk of creating new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
“It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011,” said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
Regarding interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of such bonds in order for the market to remain stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European bank exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the returns paid by the most fragile states," said a senior bond manager.
Because, if interest rates are skyrocketed, States will have even more difficulty in reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi caps the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy-risk hedge contracts (CRQ) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing some upheaval in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" about "turbulence in the markets" and about a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, their problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
Italian growth is estimated to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be implemented after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
“If necessary, further austerity measures should be taken,” said Economics Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The basics of their economy are in order and their accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are lower than those required from other countries,” said OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan.
There is the problem of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the House of Representatives, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, an unfavourable period would open up for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening crisis-fighting mechanisms
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday night and day that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to the defense of their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, the easing of European state bond rates yesterday has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of standardization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation today.
“As in May, there is a lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems,” said economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of markets.”
Aware of this gap and the dangers it conceals, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing mechanisms for exiting the crisis.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has begun a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issuance of EFSF securities is expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the U.S. would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the front-line countries, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid seeking international assistance at all costs before applying their own budget corrections and deciding on structural reforms they consider indispensable to sustainably building confidence.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, finally, are considering the options available to speed up the process of normalization of public bond markets.
On the way through Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that if the €750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe that an amount of about an additional €100 billion would suffice, “preferably” in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently endowed with €60 billion.
A advice that could undoubtedly examine the European capitals in detail.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 apartments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are currently on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
Snow layers between 2 and 5 cm, occasionally between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is strong enough to cause circulation difficulties and affect some economic activities, Météo France warns.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes has been prohibited, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles.
According to the gendarmes, movement on the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that you do not drive unless necessary and the movement of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
During Thursday, school transport in Picardy has been banned.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The Prefecture urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at Paris’ Roissy airport and 10% in Orly due to expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport in southern London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France has reached its peak, billions have been raining.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we talk about the 23 billion for the metro of the Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this GSP, the State has announced a €4 billion allocation of funds.
In theory, this amount will be the one that will allow the SGP to subsequently obtain loans in the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, we finally have the first accounts.
The 2010 Amendment Finance Act, examined by the National Assembly’s Finance Committee this morning, contains the devices intended to find the first part of that money.
There are two modes: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the office tax on the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The proceeds of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate that increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's far from four billion.
“It is specified that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that the State will mobilize and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,” we read in the statement of reasons.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"As soon as income is created (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the $4 billion later, as we explained."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to needs."
The SGP estimates that it will begin receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion pledges are not included in the credit, can provoke a slightly ignited parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Avengers Hackers and Diligent Spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” US revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi’s sinisterly ridiculous profile has long given ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats exactly what had been written in previous works (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rosicrucian).
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for novelties about the non-existent), but because those who engage in occult not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as is lazy (or has little craving) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, I do know, editor of the Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the US embassy from Rome to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
Then why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they say only what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of State can call each other on the phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have been transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer who watches research movies knows it perfectly, we just seem like we don’t know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad picture of American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secretive secrets of the world’s most powerful country greatly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the " executioners".
But let’s get into the true nature of what has happened.
In the days of Orwell, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power endure that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is in fact an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power from her.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and a lot, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, since it would be like posting it on a poster in the middle of the street.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, one cannot expect to keep confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has traveled by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is a matter of science fiction and, therefore, novel, but I imagine government agents who travel discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at most, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: ultimately, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology currently advances like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a wired telegraph (telephone).
The (analog) videotapes had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, uncovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the (digital) CDs only allow to move forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travels it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary for politics and communication techniques to lead us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was secretly planned in the embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's chap in its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked funding pledges (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been honoured.
And the French chapuzas have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged to contribute €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast-start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparency operation was appreciable and appreciated for what it really is worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without detriment to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what “new and additional” means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonization, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Nowadays, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million are added in three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, it does not refer to the expenditure of previous years or the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France’s aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while pretending to respect its commitment to “new and additional” funds...
Another crucial element is the sharing between donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that each euro borrowed equals one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often emission reduction projects that are based on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan for the country that grants the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France does not find such a reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document for your own eyes.
It is the only country in the Union that so frequently uses the loan.
Germany uses it 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments to 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to fulfill its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France is making a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to give the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional", as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has taken care of the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other Member States going to continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a relatively short-term minutiae in relation to the overall climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is indispensable to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could push forward the debates on the stakes in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently being debated): we will not get rid of the issue of "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is on other issues.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the ancient movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have significant statistical value given the limited number of samples analyzed, but they are illustrative of the problem addressed," acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that usually consume a child about ten years old in four meals and a snack a day.
These model meals, which comply with official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three parts of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, including 42 classified as possible or likely carcinogens and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
“While, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for individual chemicals are not exceeded, our study clearly shows that consumers’ exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE pollutants is worrying,” the association said.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in food, where the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were dressed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk generated by these “pollutant cocktails” to the consumer “is probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the seriousness of the situation" to implement a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 are in cereals.
