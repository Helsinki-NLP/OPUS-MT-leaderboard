At the end of the exchanges, the Prague stock exchange fell to the negative
After Tuesday morning’s fall, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trades.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague stock exchange resumed with its fall the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
The market reaction to the result of the vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the stabilization plan for the U.S. financial sector, is thus also noticeable in our country.
Stocks falling in Asia
Asian stock exchanges fell dramatically on Tuesday, even though indices managed to clear some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trading, but later it wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent as markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange were losing more than five percent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“Hesitation about U.S. bailouts will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should soon resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk that other countries would be affected.
The bloodbath of American stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the proposed financial system support, which it should have spent up to $700 billion (nearly K<0xC4><0x8D> 12 billion).
Legislators thus denied the call for support for President George Bush’s bill.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday and major stock indices experienced the biggest fall in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having seen a fall of such magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it turned out that the proposal was not adopted, it was in a free fall.
Congress gives up: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement for the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a decisive turning point in talks to adopt a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
However, success is not certain.
In fact, before Congressmen can publish the final version of the law and put it to a vote, they must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, the chairman of the House's committee on banking and financial regulation, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan is expected to be voted on in the Senate a priori.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market aid can be effective, there will be a "disappointment".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a lot of progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the shape of the market stabilization package," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, lawmakers met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the bottom of the government a final form.
It is expected to repurchase the unsellable real estate assets from financial firms, which are causing significant losses to financial firms and threatening the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
This market recovery plan still needs to be pursued, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on falling stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator did not escape Harry Reid, legislators are making sure that Congress reaches a final agreement as early as Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading starts on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the congressional decision could affect Monday's trades.
For now, however, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two Houses of Congress will proceed to the vote, or whether the negotiations are likely to remain stuck, at the last moment, by this or that problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount allocated to the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George W. Bush wanted, should be made available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the option of blocking the grant of the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion and then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in negotiations
Although the president may veto this decision, Congress, on the other hand, has the opportunity to put it in the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the repurchase of bad real estate securities, whose value dropped, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
“All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George W. Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
Spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chair Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, says legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, protecting contributors from losses, agreeing to decreases, and the time-axis plan.
The new law also provides for limiting such golden parachutes to the directors of the companies participating in the program and it establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new deposits in the case of mortgages that it is going to buy, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that it is not known what the mechanism and the price of the repurchase of the problem assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the loss-sharing between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, is, according to Marek, not as important as that.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree, as early as this week, that they support this plan and that they will enshrine it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this moment," Marek stressed.
A struggle to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
There are plenty of reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy a high-end, expensive gramophone for the home to put on Maxim Turbulenc’s new album.
On the one hand, such music products do not come out on vinyl record, and from a quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are stacked vinyl records in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, at least you probably dream of such a grammofoon.
The same goes for music on the move, i.e. compressed music, to put it simply - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have a hard time supporting headphones bought for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are functions unknown, of course, to most mobiles.
No device today is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, it is able to read music and movies, record them, has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take smartphones and communicators into account, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator can roast meat and no television will take photographs, we are virtually witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the shorter the interval between two recharges.
And playing music is one of the most important energy streams.
There are few mobile phones that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this respect, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count on that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you occasionally call from time to time, to be sure, get a second recharge for work - this is valid even for more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, as a result of a recharge, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing ones.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobiles.
As for the drives, you do not need, except (iPod), any software.
Simply fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create a media library themselves classified by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or according to the user's judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a concrete device, focus on the battery life, memory capacity, sound quality and output type and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3s.
Virtually every mobile device is capable of this.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to play.
All manage to play MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have just this format.
It is one of the most common formats and aside from it, the vast majority of devices manage to play music in WMA format as well.
AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods), on the other hand, is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to purchase a musical motive.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and is limited, in most cases, to fast-made radio tubes.
The prices are also not the lowest.
Nevertheless, it is generally believed that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, the internet, or even the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people still carry their motives.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just have to take the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which have virtually all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, you can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best and best equipped phones, also equipped with an entry for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy control.
Really anyone manages to ensure the command of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the command to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even considering the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones get away with even 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you’re one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman phones (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and some Samsung).
These devices are provided with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the ease of the control approaches that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series phones have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the farthest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe...
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, on Mobil.cz, the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, has also confirmed this.
As a result of the European Commission's latest steps in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there is no longer room for another operator, choruses with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with his own network is apparently not very lucky anymore (in fact, now he would hardly find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has resulted in a considerable price drop, to which later also the conventional operators had to react.
Yet even before parties such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to those we hear today were heard in Britain.
However, it turned out that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to win more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
In addition, behind Mobilking there is the financial group Penta, which owns the U:fon in Czechia.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order for them to operate efficiently, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are exempt from the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
This is how virtual operators around the world profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good advertisement.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work in our homes as well.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epický said: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In Czechia, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very conducive.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera Group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of corporate customers, has not, for quite a long time, concealed its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunication services, but also mobile.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations,” said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
The future may therefore be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not estimate that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with others very specific.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators are also concerned with the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited period of time, we should have a concrete agreement now.”
Vodafone instead focuses its attention on fulfilling requests for its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epický says in this regard: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of fees and shared infrastructure.
This, in our view, means the most contributions from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to discover a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: at the same time as operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore to a decrease in their profit.
What is the point of facilitating such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to understand themselves like thieves in a fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The biggest apparent pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, when the U:fon was created, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> web pages.
Nowadays, the U:fon lends itself as an argument to not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high demands."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems confusing.
However, it is not only the attitude of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
In the face of this problem, the latter took his typical position.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not a priori presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," stated in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
A statement made in this way would not come as a surprise on the part of representatives of operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Especially since Kristián Chalupa adds: "Overseas, where virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
However, pushing for an honest functioning of the market and for lower prices is apparently not part of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS's interests.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises naturally.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all gas stations is probably due to chance and hard competition.
"The Office has not identified any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore none of them has an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably even missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chaloupa said in its statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications constitutes, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator quite logically has the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators visibly proceed in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in the negotiations with all operators.
Taking responsibility back to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in communications, whereby the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted telecommunications law has not succeeded in extending the powers of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
This, the representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know very well, but their interests seem to be elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price lists for mobile phone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, there are companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specific mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company does in front of the operator figure a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special price offers (and others).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If what you're talking about happened, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would consider and that could result in a cessation of collaboration with the company in question," said Martina Kemrová.
Nevertheless, it is rather unlikely that an echo of such an activity has not reached the responsible mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned there may be thousands of customers.
An operator, however, does not oppose such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible profits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators.
Now, this is precisely what should seem strange to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
There is another question at <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
When we will no longer be the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a considerable decrease in the price of services.
In practically all countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators were sometimes more, sometimes less, trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, if not too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in the developed countries intervened, which defended not the interests of mobile operators but those of their customers.
Both by formal measures and informal pressure, they ended up creating a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are treating this issue like a hot potato that is disposed of by passing it on to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than beneficial to them in these cases.
But don't throw the handle after the ass.
If the backsliding information tells the truth and a virtual operator will soon appear with us, the Czech mobile market may be back in motion.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will only be able to remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, a choral interpretation and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to <0xC4><0x8C>eský rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose singers with young and representative voices, who are marked and appreciated for the interpretation of solo versions.
“From the beginning, I tried to make sure the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good diction, so that we understand the lyrics, which they sing simultaneously,” he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first resounded in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka (Kermesse of the savers), a Czech original piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of the Czechoslavakia in 1918, the first couplet naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "New" Anthem Sounds
Prague’s public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into its ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be inscribed in the history of the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ský Dopravní podnik (Prague Transportation Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it saved on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located at the Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í, Kadra<0xC5><0xBE>y, Letý z Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons online on the web pages of the Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can definitely forget the counters in the subway stations, where they had to hitherto trample on long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon online and be saved on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen M<0xC4><0x9B>stská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is at the disposal of passengers a desk with trained staff, which will help interested parties with the purchase via the internet and, in addition, will save the coupon they bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, it will also be possible to store electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the lobby of several subway stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminiscent of the tickets composting machines and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
Automate will control the coupon in place of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply insert the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
This is to say in the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ská integrovaná doprava (integrated transports from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with which they establish the temporary and zone validity of the coupons;" explained the control of Filip Drápal tickets of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of public transport in Prague.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s car.
During boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard in the indicated place on the side of the checkout.
This is how the driver checks the validity of registered coupons.
“In case the passenger would need to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which their coupon expires can re-join the ATMs, which were originally used to register the coupons on the card.
This is where, on the screen of the device, the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sudetes demanded a referendum in the United States
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that <0xC5><0xA0>umava be integrated into the United States.
This follows from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knihovna (Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This results among other things from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knihovna.
Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>eský Krumlov pray in the letter to the American president not to allow "<0xC5><0xA1>umavská <0xC5><0xBE>upa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter, signed "People, to whom the fate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava is at heart."
Given that the rallies to Czechoslovakia are supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only brutality, careless attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take into his hands the protectorate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava for now and forever.
“We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state that is foreign to us and that oppresses and destroys minorities and that has in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of a million inhabitants,” the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, he would have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Germans of the Sudeten at the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to imagine that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Britain would get some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, estimated that, following the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, movies, on the internet, but also in leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "blooding" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there's the phrase, "You'll pay."
This must symbolize that one can pay for life for a moment of inattention.
The spots will "hate" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of the accidents are commonly seen.
It believes that this will lead to a decrease in the accident rate and death toll on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
The sugar and whip strategy against drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to drivers,” says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, the psychologist believes.
The signs indicating the danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns of danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, President of the Provisional Government of Israel, called for the restitution of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made the statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories,” Olmert said.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without that, peace will not be made," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he said afterwards.
Golan Heights Retreat
Olmert also supported Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan retreat," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shia movement); they will have to give up their constant support for the terrorism of Hamas (Shia movement), Al-Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance car is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move inside the bus during the journey.
"If we wanted to comply with the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck who crossed the bus path.
The girl was sadly sitting next to the driver in the most dangerous seat in the vehicle at the time, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus may have an accident, or even brake abruptly, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is equipped with standing seats or not under its technical data sheet.
If this stand-up equipment is not approved, passengers shall remain seated.
Student Agency long-distance coaches do not have standing places; this has been confirmed to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by company director Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"This is an issue that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any travel of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got passengers to go to the toilet during the ride provided they had their own seat," he said.
The law ignores the steward.
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescriptions deal with that role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement does not prohibit the carrier from offering services.
The road transport law only knows the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," added Hanzelka, a spokesman.
Josef Pokorný, the head of the road traffic department, believes, on the contrary, that the law addresses the problem sufficiently.
"It all depends on whether the coach has permission in its homologation to propose standing seats.
It’s all in there,” he said.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing seats and a limited maximum speed, intercity with standing seats and a higher permitted speed, and long-distance coaches without standing seats with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says an expert.
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"During regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Nor is it certain when turbulence will occur and the stewardess of the air may hit her head."
"In case the coach braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards through internal prescriptions," he said and also felt that from the point of view of the law, the issue was not resolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only coach carrier to offer the services of stewards.
He hired two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession as a risky profession.
"Nonetheless, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky trade, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
The concern for safety is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles the director of the Asiana Alexeï Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses. We oppose it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up in a fatal accident," he said a year ago at Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has arrived.
A young hostess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who had worked for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a flashing light and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter trying to avoid him by means of a sudden maneuver, but he approached him on his right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refused that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards had been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but in terms of financial compensation, it also counts on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been under development for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the movements of stewards on board the coach.
"But it did not lead to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider stewardship activity as something that would fundamentally jeopardize passenger safety," Hanzelka said, adding that control of bus safety is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
There was no shortage of words in the letter from the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
Through a union of the entities of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be formed, according to the letter made public Monday.
The WestLB would provide a "competence block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
Overall, such a relationship could be a decisive start to other concentrations in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the injured WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
It is not only the European Commission but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that has, only recently, made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time has been spent in the search for a future solution.
For some time now, however, there has been a discussion - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of any kind between Deka Bank, which is familiar with the Sparkasse's clients through their investment funds, and WestLB.
Admittedly, the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas indicated during the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August that he saw no meaning in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, be it Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and the groupings of savings banks, has instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with the WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks, however, have only just begun, it is said in the financial space.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, has one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial centre, has come into play when it comes to consolidating the savings sector.
In 2003, it was believed that Deta-Bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate Bank and Halbab.
Yet nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
As soon as the plans had been made public, the government of the Land of Hesse had ruled against any participation of the Hellaba in them.
Afterwards, the other two houses did not join either.
The bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate was attached instead to the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the merger of the Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the board of Hellaba, had opposed any commercial strategy of merger with its bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg could be realized first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for further mergers were to increase, the potential partners gradually escaped.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she had hitherto withstood the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringian group of savings banks and transfers, which owns 85 per cent of Helaba's capital, on the other hand, locked any union with WestLB earlier this year.
The NordLB would remain rigorously.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one of the facets.
Another facet raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be matched.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, through which business model the future capacity of the banks of the Länder should be secured, had not been resolved so far by the German grouping of savings banks and transfers.
In the long run, a decoupling of the WestLb could take place, decoupling which is obviously not desired here.
This is also what is mentioned in the letter of the incumbent Executive Committee: in any case, a <0x60>global solution' for the establishment would be targeted.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, nearly a five-liter barrel of Kaiser beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival what deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta nueva station, four buses take the departure tonight at 11:45 p.m., <0x60>destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6:30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing back then and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For the past five years, they have been going to the beer party, already three trips this year alone.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come back at 10:30 p.m.
Staying overnight would involve unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome jar with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a head of the German-speaking group - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run in the night on the Autostrada direction <0x60>Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon, everything becomes calm on the bus, the travelers sleep.
It is better so, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates once again make a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco’s group finally arrives at 6:30 p.m. in the parking lot near Place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First, get your hair done with the small yellow cap.
On the left is written <0x60>Festival of beer', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency <0x60>conoscersiviagdiando.it".
“When the doors of the beer tent open, we run,” cried Marco in the early morning.
'Run!' Run and reserve seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, you have to distribute them in the room!"
The cup, cries Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instructions!
Show security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they’re gone!”
Third: 'Tonight, to be back here at ten and a half hours!'
And that's it, it's going to the beer party.
Along the way, someone tied yellow caps to trees to find the way, signs and even an election poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the Beer Festival, known as the ‘weekend of Italians’.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who set out across the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of the visitors would have come from Italy on purpose this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which performs a statistic on the countries where Italians occupy the first place before the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a luck that the politician used the word 'relatively' and that he slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This indeed happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, obtains a loan of one billion from a consortium of German banks to protect himself from the turbulence of the markets.
A confidential person told Reuters on Monday that aid credits up to 35 billion euros were issued.
Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would thus be entitled.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, it is the daughter company Depfa that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which has since been impossible due to distrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, while the equity rate had also weakened slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period in the previous year, while profits from the allocation of fixed debt and securities and the termination of provisions in credit transactions fell by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And it was only thanks to the significant profits from reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the Tax Procedures and Business Purchases Book for the Group companies that the earnings deficit of approximately 16 percent proved to be moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially misspecified on industrial real estate loans, which later had been subsidiaryized to Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa had then become more engaged in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private-state investor (PPP) projects and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter company, the Hypo Real Estate must make amortizations which should have on the calculation of the group's gains and losses an essential material effect which still remains fairly blurred.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been cut to two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is stronger than other institutions that rely on interbank refinancing because it does not have any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has again slowed considerably, as banks have accumulated their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term refinancing means annually for a portion - about 50 billion euros - of all Depfa credits.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group’s need for financing is covered by medium-term credit and the company is protected from the influence of international financial markets that are currently largely out of step.
Other sources say that the refinancing would be secured through the funds until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, the chairman of the board of directors of HRE Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority (Bafin) assume that the Hypo Real Group's market capacity is now secured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank have only to hope for it.
However, given the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest releases, still on the doorstep of insolvency Sunday late in the evening, this rescue for the least provisional will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The share price fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While debt at the top has barely moved, the prices of second-hand loans are declining.
The most affected are mainly the investment funds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and those that of course have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The bonds of Hypo Real Estate bank previously seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the very institution that brought the crisis into the establishment by the acquisition of Depfa bank.
As long as issuing institutions, governments and less affected commercial banks are still willing to support the system, it can be assumed that there will be a timely reduction in delays.
Or it will happen what no one dares to hope right now - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that was approaching security has now become a mere grounded hope.
This should reserve sleepless nights first and foremost for long-term creditors to decide whether to part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have pulled a line on to make up a deferral of losses for the next few years on the next capital income tax of the stock gains automatically levied.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to show up for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Log of Exchange, she speaks of Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What I was excited about.
Already the way to go to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way by myself, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be as strictly fixed as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after the other from eight o’clock, until at nine o’clock minus twenty, a round of table begins with the teacher, the “home room”.
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not at all like talking in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I presented myself in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all did low masses, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him through my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teens and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who was better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case it's quite difficult to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all pulled out their Bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things have a weird appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salted plums, brrrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to get a little better acquainted with the boy during the break.
I read this in my manga.
I'm curious if I could observe it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I always replied:
“Because it fascinates me, what?”
In the end, reading manga is what I have preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at one point I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations.
A rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same thing when he behaves the same way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, one can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter hard-to-work grounds because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it makes the dead, runs or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transpose our subjective experience to that of animals.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At the very least, for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that human beings are even different from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity could lie in the linguistic nature of Man: much of his existence being related to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, cannot be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses great problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is next to it another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
One could examine animal consciousness processes without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies of primate short-term memory, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one focuses more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what happens then to the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its sequels, such as the body's reactions) grabs RAM.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volubile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to attribute them to others than ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio thinks that sensations from primitive activities are born in the areas of the body sensation of the Cortex and the brainstem, just like Jaak Pankseep, which however focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could quite participate in transversal sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in humans and rats is likely to be felt as well in both cases: how could one yet verify whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Admittedly, nerve comparison helps: rats and men have similar brainstems, cockroaches, on the other hand, don’t even have a brain.
But is it the brainstem that causes sensations?
And even if it could be proved for humans, how could it be proved in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is nerve progress in that the same is measured in rats and in humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I do not know if they exist.
This might be considered short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly hitting a wall.
I am a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," said Wasjunik.
“But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the timing of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can no longer waste time.
We have to work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis.
“UEFA keeps our eyes on us all the time.”
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
In a letter to the UEFA President, we assured him that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not be affected.
Several members of the First Division have already been convicted, in the previous season, of compulsory relegation manipulation; in the end, the start of the League has even been delayed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant for counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her privacy in an interview — and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her ex-adult Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counterattacks.
A Late Rose War for Former Couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - in front of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage’s failure: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
She would have known the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his qualification as an unfaithful husband was clear: it would be “monstrous,” he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News that “Meg once again reworks the history of our relationship and manipulates it.”
It would be even more “regrettable” if “the punishment and upheavals of divorce for each child were rekindled in public” for their common 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and soon becomes the father of twins.
Thus was his answer to the claw stroke: "In any case, my life continues.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that’s doing the best.”
Airline and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become profitable again, according to a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its first-half 2008 booking data and, after rising prices in the first quarter, saw a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After hotel market prices have risen for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was sharp especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers were paid 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all of this would lie for American Express in the low dollar price that has led to a “craving for declining travel for American tourists.”
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by falling hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand with an increase of 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was upwards in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy class ticket prices fell on average by 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and first class, however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights have even been divided by two, according to the study.
On the one hand, the reasons for this fall in prices would be weakening economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand would divest in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the "Open Skies" Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the elimination by airlines of non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that reportedly filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven.
De Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
The player from Gladbach did not return until late in the game and his raised shot failed against the frame of the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled in the locker room corridor of the Hamburg Arena.
There wasn’t much going on in the locker rooms, halftime was over and most had sat down in their place.
Rieger has been the HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his request was received at the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol agreed and lifted his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The practice was lacking.
“Everything wasn’t very beautiful to see today,” Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhard would also have wished to be more relaxed.
This 1:0 (1:0 in the half), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful head hit by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
“It was a terrible victory,” Marin Jol said.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the provisional leaderboards on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to take a step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the First League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late-comers - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debauchered from FC Bayern - is forming quite slowly, but it does not shine yet.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” Jol demanded.
After the Vote Failed
On Wall Street there is fear.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones to temporarily fall by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a bit.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock market index cost 10,579 points with a good five percent drop.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at that date American Express which lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could make any more profits.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffett had partnered with the company.
As part of the bailout plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount must not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial corporation that can be exchanged in line with price developments in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.
Stock prices sucked into the vortex in Europe and the United States
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States are not addressing investor concerns.
The stock price of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the state-sponsored bailout of the financial market.
Dramatic declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The stock of the Bavarian real estate financier has lost at the moment three-quarters of its value despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank recorded a decline of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the important psychological 6,000-point bar and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Around the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government’s $700 billion bailout could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate is expected to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also saw only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index fell by 3.2 percent for the time being, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after an initial rise of 1.26 percent.

In the MDAX, Arcandor shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The multinational commercial and tourism company also said the shares would not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to soon frozen fuel pipelines, cryogenic death threatens.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what researchers have been surprised about for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent as expected according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
More than that, irregularities appear in the speed.
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the gravitational support anomaly.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still believes ironically that Einstein was not wrong and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, particularly no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter would still make up a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their abductors, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting prior to release, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom are already under way.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was reported jointly by Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian, along with their eight Egyptian escorts, are well and safe, Egyptian national television said.
The 19 participants of the desert tour should already be en route to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were released remain still unclear: the kidnappers were reportedly close to ending the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting at the station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the officer said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages, when suddenly "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday killed six of the abductors in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had found a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law who led to suicide
A court has been informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law have led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight charges of indecent conduct.
Truro's High Court of Appeal has ruled that he regularly tied his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and bound her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother was working in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a volunteer with National Trust, was haunted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had reported that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared since 2006 “emotionally dead,” and “had lost all hope for life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
We think she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the father-in-law of his daughter, who had also written a letter of confession that ended as follows: "I tied her and banded her regularly."
“I didn’t sexually abuse her.
“I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You’re really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the suicide of the victim.
And what’s even more surprising is the fact that if she hadn’t made this move, her story would certainly never end in court.”
He added: "I stress in particular, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Conviction for official data loss.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who forgot top secret documents in June on a train will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The Department of Defense man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They will have thought that this case would have remained within the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violation of section 8.1 of the act, that is to say of the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies facing the B&B bill.
British construction companies may have to pay an invoice of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys' 2.6 million savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it’s “irritating” to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will increase at the same time, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that harvest the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have behaved prudently... must now pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay an amount proportionate to the deposits it holds, and that the intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the building companies trade committee, told the BBC that he felt the decision was unfair.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have been prudent in the recovery of the real estate market now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
"We need to look at every aspect of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salty bill," Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest for the whole year will have to be paid, which could double.
Since building companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the invoice either by higher charges or lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases by up to five pennies per liter
The people of Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy has announced it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, from five pennies per liter, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, and comes as a result of research by a consulting firm.
Retailers have to decide if they will in turn raise the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had varied for the last time, in 2002.
Former Bangladeshi PM denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is likely to be arrested upon his return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her indictment for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many accusations that are made to him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country's provisional military government first give him full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she does not require bail since she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed the bail to return to the country to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami party leader said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government took power, but was released in June to treat herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina like Zhaleda Zia, deny the accusations they are subject to.
Concerns for the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children missed the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
The United Nations last week conducted a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she said she was unable to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB Loses the ITV Judicial Battle
BSkyB has lost its trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its stake in its rival transmitter ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB’s participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB acquired its shares in 2006 following an agreement to actually prevent NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that the acquisition by BSkyB of shares in ITV had raised doubts about ITV's effective independence, thereby inciting the Competition Commission to inquire.
Virgin’s boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and regulator Ofcom were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB replied that forcing it to reduce its shares of ITV would be unreasonable and on the contrary excessive – especially since BSkyB has just renounced its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of US prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of the layoff of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born from the report of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, obstructing justice.
"Serious, unfounded, potentially criminal allegations of conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the December 2006 cancellation of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department said the prosecutors were fired because of poor performance.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to give these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others have reportedly refused to investigate charges of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this layoff case, and in the end he resigned.
A number of Department of Justice ministerial officers also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, declaring that he considered him "first responsible" for these layoffs, and eventually "abdicated" his role as leader, "remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will have to be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf is due to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get that recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the hit title of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The evening of the awards ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year a selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly is one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979, ranking fifteenth.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained in the English charts for nine years, and was sold in more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, by his real name- has suffered from a health problem in recent years, even undergoing surgery to cure an irregular heartbeat after collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, severe laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in the vocal cords.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be on sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, some only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as longtime local residents do not know how to give directions to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street—not to be confused with Second Street—between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty driveway rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to rebuild Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to stores and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood landlords committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the property builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street stays in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the #3 Committee.
“There are few spaces left that belong to the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place,” she said.
“They might propose to rehabilitate and manage it, which Avalon might do, but we want to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to rebuild the small street and install seats there, some of which would be used by a café to which the builder will grant the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to exploit the street, this does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to redesign this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, noting that it was the city that suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, further stressing that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place bears this name since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving this little piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The posterior entry of CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was gorgeous," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, hails, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already spoken about the East Village’s evolution to luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should stay public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity—a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction"), tells the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac, dark by day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and blinds, full of newspapers from the past week flying along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs swiftly at the back of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the headquarters of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, on his side, said he thought some underestimated the appeal of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “are taking place in dark, wet, and disgusting places.”
Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California student, and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you thought. Why the middle class should be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Obama’s campaign stresses that “African and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program particularly supports, among many other topics, “bilingual transitional education” for those who learn English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that advocates classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The majority of students at this school are Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, consisting of many newcomers, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 State Math Exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students took the English-language-arts exam
This incredible success was achieved by another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, a constant assessment of capacities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, this school instituted the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total immersion in English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me, "We had tremendous success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you wouldn't have had any chance of identifying him."
“It works,” she observes, “it worked for us.”
Shouldn’t Mr. Obama take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools consisting mostly of Hispanic students learning English?
The excellent results of this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its tremendous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama’s response.
While he is in favour of the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
On the contrary, he said, "you have to make sure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than disdain them or consider them insignificant.
Net oil fall following the new concerns of the world of the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people fear that the bailout plan for financial markets could bring the economy back to life.
Crude oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange during sales this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street’s financial turmoil, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After seeing an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of the deep uncertainties of financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again worried despite the deal on the rescue plan, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by congressional leaders.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be durable.
In the latest episode of this financial catastrophe," Citygroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said this weekend’s frantic negotiations, concluded with the bailout agreement, “apparently failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
“The prospects for global equity, interest rates and market exchange have become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“With regards to raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally and in particular in China.”
The bank's analysts have lowered expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, so were forced to decrease by 20 percent, the forecast for oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Second Time Festival Determinant for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he saw it all.
He was watching the second time, when the Jets turned 0-0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played dirty under dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor to an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from the half.
"I didn't get out of my area," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
“He’s a poor player.”
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing wrestling, the defense beat the Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens escaped the ball because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking a 34-0 advantage.
It was the best the Jets could have scored in a while.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "the second or third time?"
When he was told the two--the Jets missed 21 undeniable points in the third half--Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpassing its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of his title as the best cross-country racer of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a 2:03:59 victory in an accommodating race on the flat, Gebrselassie broke his record of 2:04:26 last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, the 1600m marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing—maybe exaggerated in today’s eyes—that air pollution will increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track riders such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to long-distance riders, have contributed to lowering the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier, and had missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to stay bright, but not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
" Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the better."
He was blamed – especially in Kenya, the rival is African from Ethiopia – for having too much to orchestrate his races, avoiding the world marathon stars, relying in fact on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering more the world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a cross-country runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on the way.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the rowheads disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final uphill to detach from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis came third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to participate in the Beijing Games due to a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving to her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a clever strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a nice advantage, then surpassing them about 18 miles 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 afterwards.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City Apart, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, brilliant and giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first all-black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so easy to make today." The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison.
It has now become a pilgrimage town.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival in Eatonville each year to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in a variety of ways, the city it describes- has become touristic thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide edited by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place of its own.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston recounted that Florida’s black rural population was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who “knowing us so little, doesn’t know what he loses.”
Even if this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the eyes of the foreigner.
“We’re very careful about how we tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, who has been a longtime resident and the city’s oldest parishioner.
"It has to be in accordance with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover as well as a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of a Southern black rural culture—sometimes disdained, sometimes acclaimed—reminiscent of the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
Interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through sincere books full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a road that crosses the often-forgotten center of Florida, which culminates in the chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
"Passing the road on the left," she writes, "you'll find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve the passing people.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn’t that way.
It wasn’t a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's young girls that Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered as a lively, eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, aboard a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin recounted, while many laughed at her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he further adds, swinging in his chair from the posterior patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some sort of grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County public officials wanted to make a five-lane highway through town, replacing Kennedy Boulevard, the community's two-lane main street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the quarrel over the mixing of races led hatred to the gates of the community.
“At that time, a bunch of young whites came to throw oranges or objects at the people sitting on the side,” Franklin said.
"A lady has even died."
They threw a watermelon out of their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying of my race".
Residents are now proclaiming that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember well - we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief of the Eatonville Community Guard, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You're not kissing your white teacher because he's white - I mean, there's a line of cultural demarcation here," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond harm, such as herself, armed with joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It surpasses me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous tomb and began fighting to revive his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, reintroduced it to the American canons.
The highway project came just as Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston’s old neighbors regard her as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county pushed back the proposal of the highway.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Melle Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed up the whole statement stating that "Zora saved Eatonville".
Victory over the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been in our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A mono-themed library (named Hurston of course) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, revamped.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a posterior back street on a rainy summer day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Now there are 90 percent black people)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
Permission must be sought for most interviews, and certain things—such as the walls of the old church in Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields—must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a brave teacher with a weakness for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, busy, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is true of sincere civic affection that we hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, which need additional strength.
And even for the youngest, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned the description of Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, who pass through this area there, will think, ‘Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’” Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone speaks finance fluently.
Nonetheless, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stood away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "working day in the office" since the crack of 1929.
The deliverymen continue to sneak on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
The Latinos still hang between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on their shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue to buy their morning sandwiches from street vendors, and it’s still impossible to find a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to go open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work in the late afternoon, as I was discovering at my local JP Morgan Chase branch about twenty people queuing.
Not in front of the cashier's desks, nor to withdraw the cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service desk, where regular customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those before me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized staff banker," were all queuing for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and that claim to treat customers as their families.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks went bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $327, has resorted to the bankruptcy trustee, and while New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the store employees in front of me, frightened of another potential debacle, transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that does the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its lean CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor in my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my fruit and vegetable dealer.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take a risk."
Desecrated Muslim graves as Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organisation of the "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating red-striped mosques.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to the police, an organized action.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; detectives, however, believe that this could have been done to disguise the hatred of extremists towards Muslim immigrants.
This accident could somehow be related to the elections.
A spokesperson for the local Islamic Community said she was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of the desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously considering regaining its courage following its right-wing oscillation in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against wearing scarves and burkas, and even expressed opposition to Alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of a "European fraternity" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties attempt to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted just after the elections have defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made a difference because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from traveling abroad.
The courts have banned the glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed to the authorities that controlled him, his intention to travel to Spain through France.
The Kent police had conferred the travel ban on Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, or by his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the court hearing in Ashford, but was nevertheless represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday, September 25, in Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even to be registered on the lists of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He/she must also inform the police 7 days before his/her scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss Glitter's special cases or potential moves in the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: “The Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"In our view, it's easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have devices that can handle any potential risks much more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the most dear intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well, and refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end, he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge, West London court of limited jurisdiction, for the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the UK for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the Interior Ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, was reassured and pleased to learn that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments unknown to the general public, where one discovers with intimate gestures and stolen eyes artists who do not care to come on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of a few stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this side less known to artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a character of their own.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture moments of flamenco stars’ personality with the camera.”
With the "Popular Song of Mines" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, reminiscent of classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and that surprises every day".
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essentials and the magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has transformed into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing people's portraits, knowing them and being able to enter their lives for a moment more or less long.
I think in photography portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you do not know or who leave you only a few minutes to be able to take a photo of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco which is entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 of the rue de la Mata (street parallel to the People's Garden of Hercules) which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true audacious"
The novel takes place in places no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and who passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel laureate confessed yesterday at the Hay Segovia festival that the novel that currently occupies him "is a real audacity" and that "everything demonstrates that he should not write it."
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people march through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award by a majority of the votes of the participants, filled the room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself faced with a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humour, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote of a very interesting part of his work.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure amusement, an ephemeral experience," emphasized Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "gives people less like" to go, because they were asked to "go" to the writers.
Bad weather spoils the Pozoblanco fair
The flag party that ended the bullfights at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after horseback riders verified that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather on this fair hardened, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
On the poster, there were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have faced each other in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday feast took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was carried in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the uncovered stands applauded more than his fight in itself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five o'clock minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) on the border of the Municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>ón (Alava).
Police officers arrested two occupants of a van and the latter two began to flee.
Its load, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police persecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., according to information released by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit were conducting a vehicle check on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>ón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the side, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish ballots and then they transferred it to a police station for a thorough inspection and weighing the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate had been "forged" since it did not coincide with the one written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they blamed the detainee on a crime of forgery of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A.J., was placed in custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried within hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Drug
The actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the television series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effect of a drug.
A witness saw her make strange maneuvers trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California police patrol revealed to People magazine.
Around 4:30 p.m., Locklear was "deeply leaning on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going backwards several times, she rode on her sunglasses."
Soon after, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of his vehicle.
This person, at the time, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why the officers took her to the drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, although "according to police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was incarcerated around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares has asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The coordinator general and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing favorable treatments to his family members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the behavior of the political party that he will have to adopt within the city council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left demanded that the investigations be “transparent” for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: “The United Left has always defended this kind of case so that they have a maximum degree of transparency.”
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Blood of Mayo", the daring gamble of Garci
Taking inspiration from Benito Pérez Galdós’ stories, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in " Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of nearly 15 million euros.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film, "Sangre de mayo" will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a more than four-hour TV series for Telemadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós’s literature, José Luis Garci assures that he achieved with this filming “a child’s dream” thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a memorial film for the two hundred years of 2 May in Madrid, something he always accepted when the narrative held to national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been the wrong leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions during the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he was unable to shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated during most of his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a commencer" has influenced his usual way of working, the staging of actors, with whom he is used to repeat before starting the shoot and to whom he does not cast, since it seems "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and the cinema to stay informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three nominees that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de mayo", "Seven French Billiard Tables", and finally the winner, "The Blind Sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize you’re working only for prosperity, and now you’re just making one more movie,” Garci says after more than 30 years of a professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the shoes of Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will live in London with his family.
She was a free dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to play the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" reminded me of a popular Cuban dance and "the serpent dance" to certain tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers,” she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta openada"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who has been exceptionally willing to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me.”
The staging was also thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; to the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as to the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who played the role of the eternal companion.
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, such as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it's these women who have a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows or highlights her work," Bayón said.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently married poet" in the church of Saint Stephen's in New York, place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate their "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón's fiveth anniversary" (2006-2008), organized in order
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-issue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after having travelled to the different provinces of New York, has been iracious.
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets.
America Likes Less Without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and illustrates well the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
He hasn’t been running since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow to everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels exceeds all expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better because of its existence.”
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of film and homeland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets frightened, Americans' esteem fell down, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there is only admiration left to human beings and there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the advocate of lost and defeated causes, as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that struggled against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept through Hollywood without paying any attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was the culmination of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He put the bar high for us,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to pierce the screen like Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having serious privacy and away from goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though the opportunities were not lacking.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he pridefully watches his daughters meet his fans on earth, something not so common in America.
“Among all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist,” they say.
Madrid in the race to organize the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could come true in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I've ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of a playoff score.
But let’s look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors begin with the removal of the backsheets, which forces you to go ahead.
This is not bad but if they move you it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for racing).
Well, no.
They were making you go there only to take the backpack (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small-sized jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we hadn’t left our backpack at the entrance yet, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults took place from the barracks.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that I think didn't properly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, this one would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At MIT's Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft was introduced a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of AI with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) in response to a conversation asked when it was asked.
Through a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listening and hearing the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversational groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she's here to visit someone and she tells him she'll answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has continued to add features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance, but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on Google’s part to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It occupies the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the "death" of the operating system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who are half the applications that come with the system?
Who can do the most can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, cluttered months, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I’ll show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of Microsoft’s employee rest rooms in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster their request to use their own search tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week there was a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But since the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them expensive.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endorsed it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the outfit of the muscular gay association.
And if we start to list all his appearances, we could also mention this strong mustache who was lifting weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple cotton men's body jersey, tight and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' stands out from the rest by its excellent cotton, by its unisex cut, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that the most well-known bodysuits have in their neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand not only produces tank tops.
But she also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even though it is a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me."
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not stop him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
It was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish company sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but at the same time exciting day awaits us.
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we take great inspiration for our collections.
I like to walk around the city and watch the women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
A dancer, actress and cartoonist, you are a very versatile woman: right?
I think so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to look in my aunt’s closets and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
Dancers like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you take on the clothes, that's when you really get into the character's skin.
Suddenly, everything is linked.
You didn’t have 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s make me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did all the things I wanted to do since I was a child and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're becoming a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me to, and moreover, I want to become a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can’t wait to see the movies ‘The Last Hour’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ’.
Let's see what you'll think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to do the model.
Simply put, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to take part in a charity parade in London for her women's support association and the clothes we exhibited - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were being auctioned to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender-hearted person.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things aren’t true.
Also, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the Third World.
Recidivists of alcohol at the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants that the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the start of the vehicle in a state of drunk, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its goal is the reintegration of the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety, as well as the General Directorate of Road Safety and the Technological Institute for Automotive Safety Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunk, take the car back.
The alcohol lock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced offences by up to 65% in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This is due only to administrative penalties for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means but, however, the reform carried out by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without peep-toes
At 17:40, the official time scheduled, the Spanish air force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of going down but its rays still required to put his hand as a visor to be able to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official journey.
- Oh, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... Are you from here or so...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish but I lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
They are several to be waited in the airport hangar near the red carpet and on a military row consisting of 27 Marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual peep-toes; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing into the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The most prestigious prize in fashion
There is surely no place in the world more suitable to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is surely no more extraordinary and good living cartoonist than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, watched her models in the Mango showcase at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she cried almost emotionally.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the designer Valentino, president of the jury of the contest, made us end up in a luxurious dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the extraordinary Chagals family’s table next door, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having a big heart and making good heart against bad fortune, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a Mango garment and some breathtaking ELAH ornaments, and arms on it, arms down with her son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in her honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rotchil ended the evening without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with pants and a shirt - from her own collection - and who for dinner was transformed by wearing a long dress sexy and black, was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and remembering the 'great old days, she made a gesture' of it.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace outbuildings, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his linens, his towels and having asked in advance that there was no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The morning wake-up almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 o’clock, but it’s even worse when you think about the restless rhythm that current life imposes on us.
The desk is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and work-related problems.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is titled '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at bookstores directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places like work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run into your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some kids talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk in their sleep.
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a mild alteration of sleep that is called sleepiness.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, there are more than one who talks at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep impairments such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (piping in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful situations or overexcitement.
In any case, it is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with screams, weeping, long speeches...
In case sleepiness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We said it is a mild impairment, which is why there is no treatment unless it is related to another sleep impairment that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV shows that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as sleepiness appears, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), don’t be tempted to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because while sleeping, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate them during the night to learn their secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern has finally regained the path of victory on his field after a long period of starvation.
Without making a big match, the Yellows and Blacks created themselves the most opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann who was approaching the skylight on a shot from afar, Illhaeusern would take the ascendant slightly and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Romain at the end of the foot or Diebold came to tickle Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we were blocking in the middle of the field and just leaving the Riahi stirring at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhusians by Marais, well positioned to retake a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd').
But the Illhusian goalkeeper will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any big problems to an Eleven illhusian who just retreated a little to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of the game where, after a big crush, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of fishermen who severely disrupted Monday the accesses of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the rise in diesel prices, which reached a record at more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected on foot by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing plugs of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le did not stop.
A filter dam has been put in place on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, from the dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic and Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers remained at the dock, or in Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and du Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total de Donges refinery.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting in the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the planned interview at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go of anything" and "do not want to move to Paris," announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chair of the committee of fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, are currently paying around 50 cents per liter, but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a diesel less than 0.30 euro per liter.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes hailed the film legend and engaged actor, Paul Newman, passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year despite recession threats to the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aeronautical manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 delivered aircraft, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market especially for its aircraft in the range from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which U.S. monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets to repay the $85 billion it has been given, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its retirement business in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the matter.
AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to discuss possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to split include its international air leasing subsidiary Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly cash in to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders in due proportion.
Analysis Paris Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange posted a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The tech-dominant Nasdaq index dropped 199.61 points at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (or 106.85 points), at 1,106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street plunged after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the bank bailout plan that was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two in three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market was counting on this," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come "too late".
“If the project is actually dying ... then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the downfall of a financial institution" in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organized the acquisition of Wachovia’s banking activities by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated abruptly, pushing for emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year Treasury Bond yield fell to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year Treasury Bond yield to 4.161 percent, compared to 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama wins the first TV duel
In Friday’s first debate between the two White House candidates, another succeeded to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that was allegedly followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "brilliant enough" to allow him to halt his decline in the five-week polls in the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% to McCain), found that it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones that count, Obama came out winning for 39 percent of the polled, while 25 percent of them conceded the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his boxman, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts," Bill Clinton said.
The 70-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his undisputed experience in foreign policy, while underlining his opponent’s “naiveness” on those issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he has accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama said he was representing the future.
Without dismantling, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, while Obama, yes,” he replied, this weekend, a Democratic spot reproaching the Republican for not taking full measure of the impact of the crisis on the “Street American.”
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people assembling for an election meeting in North Carolina in the rain.
He didn’t even utter the words “middle class” or “workers.” The financial confusion clearly benefits Obama, which is seen by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the brink of a precipice.
"The coming week could be a turning point," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to Bill Clinton’s during the 1998 financial crisis.
The current debacle "is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy pursued by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that he would still succeed in reducing taxes by 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's upheavals, the senator of Illinois also pointed out that achieving the country's possible energy independence through the promotion of renewables was his first priority, with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain, meanwhile, wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, the two candidates dodged questions about the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial bailout adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents were demonstrating Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night after polling stations in Minsk’s central square closed to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislature.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit that they didn’t even vote, “For what good, since they will do what they want with my voice,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression on foreign observers in order to retake language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turning point.
The sanctions, including the visa ban on 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections were considered proper by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting," said Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
“It’s a cosmetic change,” said Alexander Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, “because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our country, it’s the executive branch.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "dialogue with the European Union must be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the election.
She stresses that turnout figures seem too high, and that the widespread advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the door to all manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there was an election, do you?" asks the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
The interview - Blood became safe again
Héma-Québec was celebrating the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice as Héma-Québec became one of the world’s safest and most effective blood suppliers.
And most importantly, he regained the trust of the public who had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this tragedy and the grunt of the public, the Government of Canada initiated a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
As Justice Krever was delayed in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its business, just 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," she said before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease were seen in Europe, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the one that holds the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when it is not known and a serious disease may result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, blood was refused for those who had stayed more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
Now, a few years ago, it was proven without a doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing appeared on the market: the nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which allow the detection of the presence of the virus itself and not of antibodies to the virus directly in the blood of donors, on which the tests used so far were based.
The TANs have shortened the silent period, which extends between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors will be infected without knowing it and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly lowered the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products annually, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that we can now feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says the CEO of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
It is never known which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continues, before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide adequate supply.
“Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a refill of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which accounts for an average of only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Anyone who is 18 years of age or older and who meets the eligibility criteria can give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country with malaria, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors must be renewed as they age and can no longer give their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Because today’s life is so busy, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also operates the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample and we plan to take more than a thousand cord blood samples per year.
We should start proposing for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed in not being able to access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program at all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division playoffs, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 goals total) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series total goals at Stade Saputo.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a goalless first half on either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets of the Montreal team.
Roger Levesque was the only one to defeat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first round of the round-trip series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will compete at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the semi-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Victorious Goal of Kovalev
The Canadian’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian dam shots against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to do too much in the first half," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation.”
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the initiation of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest visited yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to get elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Rebuilding the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the main lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of picture mill.
They turned in loops, on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in election periods.
In a press briefing, the prime minister refused to rule out that he would trigger elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At the very least a few avenues of what could be further developed: notably hydropower, forestry, but especially the mining sector, powered by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's home, it's in Quebec.
It’s not only in us, it’s in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec has built up a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press briefing.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has not been an agreement in a very long time, and when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open year-round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already begun consultations with some 30 communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a great meeting, “not necessarily a summit”, but a moment when “we will give ourselves a common vision”.
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerned, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Centrale Beauharnois to the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydropower, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press, he invoked another reference, conservative one, the program "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest pointed out that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
"It stays between us there, but I plan to be there," he told his militants, sparking nourished applause in their homes.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering an election this fall, as the law allows him.
He stresses that his schedule is fulfilled, however, notably by a mission of the Council of the Federation in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that have been passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council and that the latter would have a veto on decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad lines of the Plan Nord were welcomed with skepticism.
The Pequist leader, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today," commented Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote taking place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercury.
The ADQ said it supported the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (o irony) in the Harper cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To cast disgrace on this woman who has waged a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration, says as much about the Prime Minister’s entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
This is a government that is the only one among all the Western countries involved that has not repatriated its national imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts he is accused of.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier crumble in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
As a reminder, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr for a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not care if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", the word that Harper keeps shouting and sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when no more morality exists: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen at the good will of a leader of government up to now a minority (what will it be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Discourse by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Pursuing Orwellian logic, he claims that the world’s largest gold company has filed a six-million defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small penniless publishing house with the aim of launching a “transparent public debate”.
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecution in defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers backed by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will gag the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada normally occur through the exchange of ideas and not through the use of batons.
It was therefore sufficient for the mining industry to open its books, files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects the petitions and letters of support for the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both demand a "public" debate while despising the opinions of the same public?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word refers only to the highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because they reject the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not as part of what many perceive as a gag suit (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a formal notice to the authors of Black Canada urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal discourse, the prosecution of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in its entirety, the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that displease the wealthy businesses of this world in a country like Canada, or else repeated prosecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s excessive prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for academia, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of committed public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default, as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to the managers of the companies rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican negotiating representative Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news just minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything was done in a way that protected the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing Wall Street crisis,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and disruption in Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had turned into a sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect of a further failure on investor mood.
The deadline agreed upon was the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately involved in the negotiations, the two U.S. presidential candidates were rather supportive of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction that we were forced to reach this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited himself with adding certain provisions to the agreement, including the one to allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the salaries of business leaders who have been rescued by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no way to congratulate them.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on American television broadcasts.
Asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The broad lines I have read [show] that this is something that we're all going to have to digest and with which we're going to be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to redeem with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unsellable debts of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes) before expanding to other more widespread forms of credit securities (CAAPs) and leading to a freezing of liquidity and the debanking of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican constituents who had the first draft of the agreement overturned last week.
It is believed to have come out of this impasse since Democrats agreed that some of the "toxic" assets of troubled companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to round the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to bear losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it regain its placement.
The new plan provides for a first instalment of $250 billion, to which another $100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion is expected to be approved by another congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain stakes in the rescued companies that will be worth dividends in the event of profit and that it will be able to resell when the turmoil is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures for homes attached to real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and severance pay paid to managers of affected businesses.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the House of Representatives vote today, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
In fact, votes continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
"Obviously, Washington isn't listening to you," House Finance Committee member Scott Garrett told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the benefit of the taxpayers.”
An animator of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of skeptics," Democratic Representative Brad Sherman puts things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: Congress is being asked not to rush and to carefully consider the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for €11.2 billion (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was refusing to acquire its competitor in the midst of shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"It's not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, we recover a right to vote in the bank and influence.
This is precisely something that savers and households appreciate now that the times are uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government seemed on track to nationalize another bank mistreated by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than $41 billion (US75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
Spain's Santander bank said yesterday it would buy the bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Her beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time her asset card, some will say her weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity, and a source-flowing talent will also have removed him from the power register that brings forth the true sacred monsters.
But what a great cross-country runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the splendid years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of liberty and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will emerge one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate quality brand.
For in it a whole country enamored with self-made man projected, from the Pacific War fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theatre, on television, soon to the cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second at the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, doubled with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the shadow zones of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the bursts of show business, whose enigma we will not have quite pierced.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman caused moviegoers to feel dizzy this weekend, as his big roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a perpetual changing American art parades through it.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a hot roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958, is back in memory.
Closer to us (1990), we refer to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newman have gone into history.
This delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano in Robert Wise’s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, reprised after his death, who really released Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic malfrat in the brilliant The Sting (The Scam), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen’s beautiful The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character on the return in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar out of nine nominations.
That face through the ages was him.
That's him again.
The epochs are moving through his journey.
The young people know him mostly through George Roy Hill's cult Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against several film legends who quit the trade early enough, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its praises and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging its performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender to the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles fell for a long time all cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginals: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect features reflected drift and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed some unfamiliar facets of his true pudic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes pouring out yesterday on Newman, his great boyfriend and former weapon companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) affirmed, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of Hollywood drift.
Many have seen his binet throat on vinaigrette jars, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging the process of fairly bad taste, though gag at first.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to its Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will have committed to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and beyond.
What could Zuschlag & amp; Company do in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, hearings will begin regarding the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, having caused particularly significant damages. Other charges have been held against them, such as, for example, forgery and the use of forgery.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand into the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand into the pockets of some people.
Their method, which was also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing cost invoices, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus the associations never met their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoice books from the Józsefváros market, while they manufactured the pills in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the testimony of the latter, he had to identify pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they were going to introduce, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with writing the files necessary to obtain the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of the choices of Sides was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice issued in the name of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, which will later bear the name of Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, was full of errors in form and substantive.
A guest house in Badacsonytomaj actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there.
The invoice issuers with an overwhelming imagination also fell into excess when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither the name of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért nor that of Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor's office.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the manager of the company, told the website hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people stayed there, did not stick either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
Emittents of zealous invoices also did not inquire about Budapest travel agencies, being part of their choice, but only organizing trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the agency's accounting practices.
Moreover, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the services relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices issued on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp to the order of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, the employees of the hotel only issue printed invoices, while the fakes were handwritten.
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes in mentioning as a service the carriage of goods by road, which the invoice-issuing company could not exercise, given that its profile was investment advice.
Moreover, it is also for defects of forms, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó sports training, both of which deny that they are the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Nor did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at their home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denied having issued this invoice.
Deliberately established invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is those who were fully aware that they were required to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has issued an invoice to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért from the Együtt Foundation, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Likewise, cooperated with Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the order of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület Association, which were not provided, for an amount of approximately five million HUF.
There was no financial movement either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies did not mention this in their accounts.
The next category of invoice-issuing companies is those of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the general manager of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose registered office was in Budapest, but where he was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was allegedly purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov also reportedly sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their counter-value.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian Masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies worked, which the accused explains by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He used these companies anyway, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the acts of foundation of the companies, he issued invoices in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov has given to organizations, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecution thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a grant application to the socialist party's public service organization, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this grant for twice HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from becoming known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, it was these invoices that were found during the search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will report on the method of making the invoices, as she had previously done before the prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps the Socialists would have reached an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably annoyed, since applications for his placement in supervised residence, on the basis of a lightening of his conditions of detention, continually fall into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of unreparable economic offences, walk freely or at least, wait in their own homes for the end of the procedure.
The Psychology of Overbiding: Why Do We Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have managed to update the neurological and economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans do not want to be distanced in this type of competition, such as an eBay auction, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research attempted to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group participated in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction, a key element of which is the one-third overbidding, the set under the brainstem, called striatum, was moving heavily when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the "self-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight to the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers pursued financial supervision analyses.
During these, three groups were overbidden against a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15, in reward.
While the third group received this $15 before the auction, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is actually that the emphasis was on victory in one group, while in the other was on failure.
By proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team of players "against failure" were willing to bet higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed at auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in the face of risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped remove the contradiction between the two theories by leading now to a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When Should We See a Doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is among the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that there are one hundred miles of patients carrying the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles are undergoing treatment. This is due to the fact that often patients do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and engendered diseases differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travellers are recommended to get vaccinated against A and B viruses anyway. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated foods, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach aches and nausea.
Then on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice develops, the stool becomes lighter and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die from the most severe form of this disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not known to have the virus, because the pathogenic gene sneezes the liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms do not appear until after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than average among a population of three groups: people who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does one who grows in God feel the least pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would already have contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article that researchers at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment in analyzing how much belief in God could influence human pain tolerance.
As part of this at least bizarre experiment, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Through a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university participate.
Specifically, the experiment proceeds as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing electroshocks is fixed to the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look sustainedly at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experiment hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not much different from the first, concerned its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, received 20 electroshocks in four parts successively, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed one.
The Catholics said that at the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like “safe,” like someone “who is taken care of” and they “calmed themselves, and peace has invaded them.”
When viewing the religious theme painting, they reported 12% less pain than when looking at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
"We should find an image that they react very positively to, such as a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, the Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
“The practice of faith should change and in many cases effectively change our personality,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if we showed the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the sight of a better quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You are what you disclose about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found in the bottom of people’s pockets just like the sky above their heads. It knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what their interests are.
This is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While skeptics are paralleling Orwell’s horror vision, they do not see the essentials of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times recently that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary for Google's founders to meet their initial goal that sounded like: "Let's collect all the information in the world in a system!".
According to the Google CEO, after ten years of global shifting work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What job would be best for me?" However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, until the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all internet users that the words used during searches on the internet, the IP address of the computer that starts the search, and the pages viewed by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the program Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have searched for, what they have clicked on. Through this, long-term Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized responses, and will submit our previous preferences and products and services based on our statement.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about seeing Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can provoke fear, and it is not remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can provoke counter-reaction among internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the search terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are passed on to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
Probably the most striking example in recent times is the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google passed on to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human rights-minded Internet users were able to sigh a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm-up with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right to court against the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will still not be able to be obliged by any of the constitution’s points to disclose information about the FBI’s secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier, but ultimately it is not able to obtain the lists of private user searches, or the entire list of websites and keywords over the past two months.)
So Google’s judgment is quite contradictory: it is harassed by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services, so they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against multinational corporations proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "wildlings" bringing together the passionate, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "connected corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, and this even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very accurately the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, pulls right behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 is about nothing other than collaboration, than the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use communication channels at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or to last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link these to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep photos on recent Flicks, in which they appear more automatically on their blogs.
While we can take note of many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that has fired one of its employees, only for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about our private life, we can be sure of one thing about top management.
The person who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how one can define the principle that hides behind the behavior of today's young people.
Someone wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to bypass Google’s monopoly, can do so (by starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who, deliberately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. The services of Google online, from the word processing to the image processing, to the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks until this day and which do not assemble.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at an increasing rate cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators.
However, the critical observers find, alongside all of this, contradictions with disturbing effects: for example, the top management of the company refused, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it doubled the price of the company's kindergarten and after the company has found too expensive the daily multiple catering, taken at any time. All this seems derisory to the Chinese government that has already done the same thing.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are not announced before health analysis only when they can be used. What's on, is that in the coming months and years they'll make the world move on new points. While some think that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines of Google takes such important dimensions that the company's other problems can soon be found in front of the court.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors.The famous novel by Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian halftones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way just through Google data.
Two minors helped remove traces of <0xC3><0x93>zd's double homicide
"The police have summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of <0xC3><0x93>zd's double homicide. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime," - said the spokesman of the Borsod department police station.
The young people have acknowledged the facts they are accused of, and for now, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are girls, defend themselves freely.
Complicity in murder can result in detention for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old young man from the corner, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed premeditatedly and out of interest.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and it is for this reason that he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of the man, 9 years old.
According to MTI reports, the young man premeditated his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the scene is proof.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the repurchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech business daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid to date for the repurchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those concerned, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the least good new owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by market specialists to be between 5 and 10 billion CZK.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent stakes, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, which are getting worse from day to day, the leading European press newspapers already refer to a "second 9/11".
"The global financial catastrophe, we owe it to the American president" - accuses the Rome daily, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a hurry, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett put it, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing every day, and after that, the whole world will pay the heavy price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, but according to the congressional vote, a real danger threatens, one that Washington does not propose a political tool to address the crisis.
The world economy hangs in a vacuum, just at a time when in the history of capitalism one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer - stresses the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states may still provide a lifeline to their titulating financial organizations, and with their taxpayers’ money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to pay little attention to their national selfishness, and to centralize control over the divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Viennese daily Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, similar to Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is crossing the old continent from side to side.
"Saviors" should not immediately wave 100 billion euros, on the other hand, it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch the money of taxpayers, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The intelligent automobile imitates the theft of the bumblebee
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, other than the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
Like, for example, the bees.
In the amazing project presented at the CEATEC, taking place in Japan, buzzing bees gave the strategic idea to Nissan engineers, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini-robot, a bio-inspired BR23C self-driving system equipped with bee qualities, with the ultimate goal of encouraging the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval-shaped, which in reality looks a lot like our secure protective shell - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a primary role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, mimicking the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If it weren't, the mini auto robot wouldn't be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," said Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where collision is currently considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
In contrast to bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that the bees have to avoid the other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotational movement, the acceleration as well as the slowing as manoeuvres at the disposal of the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses lighter lithium polymer batteries with a larger energy concentrate, making their lifetime longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism only needs to process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don’t need a memory of gigabyte capacity, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards designing an instant avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will make its way into mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination while avoiding obstacles in his path.
We even gave the baby an overpriced name.
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout plan, aimed at repurchasing dubious credits from banks, and to use in multiples, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters says that in new debates lasting until after midnight on Saturday, East Coast local time, congressional leaders have agreed on controversies that have been going on for days and days, around the $700 billion bailout.
“We’ve taken a serious step forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, after which all that remains is to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born out of the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, this is not about the rescue of Wall Street, but about turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before Asian markets opened on Sunday evening at 8 p.m., Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to Central European local time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock market.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill under the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
Moreover, the program diverges from the Bush administration's initial proposal, which stated that the $700 billion should be spent at once, for the buyback of bonds in dubious credits.
From now on, a maximum of half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after the law is passed by Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to buy dubious claims from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the Federal Reserve President will also participate.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: it will be able, at the same time, to buy dubious receivables, securities involving dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" receivables.
Competent departmental officials said that buybacks can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that cause the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it be the vast redemption of dubious debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or the other major financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for law enforcement, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders in poor postures awaiting state aid can expect their severance allowances, called simply a golden parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
The wage cap is mentioned only in specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers assistance to the business.
The capping principle means that if the Treasury secretariat purchases through an auction, they will levy a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank chairman retires.
Directly after the repurchase of the dubious claims, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it is necessary to add that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap is only for new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in U.S. history that legal caps will be in place on the appointments of directors general - commented House Financial Benefits Committee Chair Barney Frank Democrat.
In addition, the state acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President will have to bring a proposal to Congress that will decide how the losses will be reimbursed to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why American citizens have mandated us, it doesn’t protect taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
Her Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes they are the same ones who press for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to the month of August 2007 - reports the Central Statistical Office of Hungary.
Industrial export sales prices increased 1.1 percent from July 2008, while compared to a year earlier, they decreased by 3.9 percent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices increased only to a lesser extent: 0.1 percent, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry sectors increased by only a tiny 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather goods and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), with first, bag and belt manufacturing with a monthly increase of 4.6 percent, then footwear production with 2.5 percent monthly increase.
Higher prices for plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices for the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery and equipment manufacturing (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase, ranging from 0.2 percent to 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which are a major factor in domestic industrial exploitation, prices rose 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the effect of rising gas prices introduced by the authorities since July 1.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales of the processing sectors, oil processing sector prices experienced the most significant increase (32.4 percent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the major food, beverage and tobacco sectors, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price decreases occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacturing of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
Throughout the processing industry, prices increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded 18.7 percent of the previous year's prices.
Among the domestic trade groups and according to the allocation of sectors, in August, it was the sectors initiating profit-on-investment that showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and material production sectors for further processing did not change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and material production sectors for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while for the profit-initiating sectors, inflation was measured at 1.4 per cent.
Industrial export sales prices, in HUF, rose 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro and by 7.1 percent against the dollar. Compared to the month of August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and by 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that the Hungarian-American visa waiver agreement will come into force on January 12th, as the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
“Now, everything depends only on when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into service.”
All the time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to check in before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the decoration of the Commander’s Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support bank bailout
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, assured their support for the $700 billion government bailout plan. However, there are politicians demanding the resignation of the U.S. Treasury Secretary.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives in Congress and the administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they have reached agreements in principle on the bailout plan of the banks.
This financing plan, aimed at thawing the Wall Street crisis and the crippled credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more apt than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama once again managed to get a little ahead, and McCain’s advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as colister just after the Republican convention, melted.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would swiftly pass the 700-billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supports.
"It is now that we must act responsibly ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to call McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all have a hard time swallowing it ... but doing nothing is not a possible way.”
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal referred to the creation of a Treasury Oversight Commission and the capping of senior officials' severance allowances, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of the Reds and Blacks.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the CSU erosion began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change in era is at the same time the problem of the whole of Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday came to an end a process that was probable just ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of the national party has ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was picking up at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", implemented in the region in a consistent way by the CSU.
For 40 years, sociologists have been announcing this, but they have been very wrong about the pace, but the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of northern and eastern Germans in the developing region of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the fidelity of CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the party have voters become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have rather distanced themselves from the CSU, such as the self-employed, the artisans, the holders of the baccalaureate and the graduates.
In these groups, support for the CSU fell below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on the reserve in the face of coalition issues", the Austrian conservative daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that has settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian SPÖ socialists want to talk with the conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from meddling in its internal affairs.
The populist BZÖ party is open to negotiations. The Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
Elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates organized on public television, party leaders barely let their cards see.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to talk with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer approach was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann attempts to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or joining the coalition is a very open matter for a moment, and these points must be discussed in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
“To avoid the Red and Black coalition, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities,” Haider said.
Járóka said: We must break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began in Paris as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP of the Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects Roma children the most and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of the deputy Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka warned that in addition to the distinctions observed during the hiring, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualifications.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of poor elementary education, only a tiny few have the opportunity to obtain a graduate degree."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role when other fundamental rights are to be asserted.
Investing in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child begins school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"Due to their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and protected from a low quality and sectarian education." - emphasized Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, a goal-oriented cooperation and action by the European Union is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of disintegration of schools, and compliance with the existing and in preparation anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment; we must give the possibilities provided by democracy to Roma children so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - demanded Járóka.
On behalf of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" ensured for all, the objective of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe, held every year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to ensure a single platform to support the measures taken to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination, aimed at the European level and at the level of the member countries.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
The decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed.
The party chairman Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still hold their place. The question is how long will the grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair, in any case, made it feel that they were not particularly attached to their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the fraction and base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the peak of his career - the Christian socio-union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
But the Conservatives still count strongly in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates tactile discussions with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Electors coalition, formed along the right-wing values of the party.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislation, whose action against Stroiber served as the possibility of a coup perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, to then deal with the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now the CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far been behind the scenes, will also be given an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks to the CDU, which he said deserved much more support from the Brother Party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will be able to be Chancellor again only if they in one way or another, with a common force, re-establish the CSU, which played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground by the CSU will not negatively influence the Berlin grand coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals : 110 - 0
None of the opposition MPs reached the Belarusian parliament after Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures it prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-person legislature in this country of 10 million people has been doing very well in opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as president for the fourth time in the dubious elections 2006, "in the footsteps of the opposition"
In this way, the ODSZ has renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically dependent increasingly on Russia, would want to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the Belarusian political order called undemocratic, Lukashenko and several top politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition, and Belarus has to take a credit of the Russians to the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the campaign, emphasized positive changes rather than failures, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates, referred to prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE communiqué on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political detainees have regained liberty, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia.
“We have taken two steps forward, and one step backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU,” Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that "the power in this parliament, which has no weight, has been afraid of bringing in even a single opponent".
The opposition does not anticipate protests in view of the results, but instead tries to convey its message on the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on that side: we have to have our opponent newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the wheels when it comes to dissemination, but I can also see that they are more and more appropriate to support the elections, even in the circle of the elderly," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Luka's most important security.
“Because of the country’s debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, ‘evoking the silence of a cemetery,’ is only a matter of time,” Milinkevitch said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the election a democratic one.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had no revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But starting today, this new measure is in effect against the little clever ones, against whom points and then goes to drink the coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-lazy novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“The revolving doors,” says Brunetta, “are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services,” says the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta said.
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Council is complemented by the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of the employees was recorded, assures the secretary general: "This is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissants.
Brunetta’s promise, which suggests with a smile, “a good cappuccino at 7am is an excellent and healthy resolution.”
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
"In three months, the absence of sickness of public employees has decreased by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in a year."
And he adds that it is indispensable to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics have doubled over the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector, and well beyond inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees came together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree using the Codacons.
""while the Minister of Public Service today is spreading the data regarding the decline in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness--writes the consumer association--the people of the 'lazy active' continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive Public Administration employees have come together to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of disability due to service is disputed; the extension of the schedules of the sick worker's housekeeping hours, during which the checks are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Workplace Accidents, Napolitano: "Crucial Prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 workplace accidents, 3 deaths and 27 permanently disabled people.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that white deaths were around 1,200.
Figures show the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the leading causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To attract the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data released by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of the Mutilated and Disabled at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses "sincere appreciation for the continued associational effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and public awareness"
Naturally indignant, everyone has punched the fist to put an end to such tragedies that, by their dimension, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness among young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the Speaker of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions, to make a concrete effort aimed at ending it quickly".
The data of the accidented on the job seem to signal a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive anyway," said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
“We do not want this ‘discounted tendency’ to be translated into a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes that tragedy occurs.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
“We believe that more controls and inspections are needed, as well as more intervention on the training of workers, right from school.”
- He added- "there is still an effort to make in terms of communication and public awareness.
"But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding compensation for victims of work" and the "deviation of assistance towards which the system has been geared in recent years".
“The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance in such a way that the fate of the person who has an accident, must not depend on the spontaneity or the enlargement of the legislature.”
Mp3 player pointed with the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players, can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a statement released in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific report, let's read in the note, it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable music devices, for more than an hour a day and a week, risk permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use mobile music devices and full-volume mobile phones may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," Kuneva said.
“According to the scientific data,” continued Ue, “this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
In addition, we need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"The scientists-concludes the executive Ue- confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but concern is growing about hearing damage that could derive from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit this data by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods of time are at risk of permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years.
This concerns 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to about 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will develop the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - it would like to stress Alemanno - it will have to propose ideas of development of Rome that the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council, will be able to use.
No overlap of roles, but only the willingness to have a corner where to develop a big project for Rome.
In March, she will have finished her tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June-announced the mayor-we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper prospect, seriously working on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome would like to stress that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to Roman city dwellers, and will be used to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it takes a draft of strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city, to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit, ".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but that will look further" not only in the light of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also "in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to act as an independent wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the part of his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the date of the elections approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
Obama is really fucked up: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all the voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: Once in the polling booth, we know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
Here emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
“Say what you want, we’ll see ourselves put the cross, either on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these arguments, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the mistakes Bush made during his term of office? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the buttocks.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush’s weak point.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppression. And many accuse the Internet, this "murder" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly tell attachés of the information, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the assembly of the newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that, according to the interviewed journalists, needs to be solved if traditional journalism, as the general public hears it, is not to be reduced significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Published against broadcast.
Journalists have no problem seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are struggling to make a move to the Internet, perceived by many as the "murderer" of newspaper paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using the technology in the hope that it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest crook in American journalism lies between who runs the newsrooms — that is, the directors — and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, that percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to the “safety of work”.
Directors who expect to lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, we are going to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can make $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a certain number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “sick” during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS A GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the proceeding of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
. Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation investigation.
During his trial last week, he had been granted home release and had been converted into mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be able to travel from the provincial city to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow it to influence its company and have access to the evidence that accuses it.
Elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
Yesterday’s New York Times confirmed this by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its moderate East Coast soul, favorable to federal institutions as well as the business community, and its new, conservative soul, hostile to “the Washingtons” and the world of finance, powerful especially in the central and southern states.
The soul, precisely, which was made to feel despotically with the vote I was talking to you about at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is only one example of the changes, the great changes that the ongoing economic earthquake predicted or already lets go: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been breeding for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary revival, of the double category of state-sovereign, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that have, obviously, close relations with foreigners, but that, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of people and families who live in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalization seems really out of the question, or has little to say: the obvious evidence is provided by the European Union, which, as usual, is shared between the various interests and between the various national strategies, can not decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each state that everyone is waiting for interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all an affection for credit: when we are going through a difficult period, it is only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the still major importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite tied to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at once that our future will have to settle more and more with the rather little material things like water.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than he who is not, that is, he who is unlucky to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shade.
And besides, something even deeper, in a sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, feeds underground, either a powerful and branched movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest in the "improvised electoral revolts" or else, in the changes of collective moods of the last time, from the conservative rise in Austria to Bavaria, to the rebellion of the Great Workers.
One has the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, one would say, have ever more difficulty, which is not from today, to understand and therefore represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and agitates potentially in a disproportionate way.
In view of all this, speaking of a current “rebellion of the masses” on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But they say well, keeping your eyes wide open, that's not without reason.
The super glue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has nearly succeeded in doing so.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a 100 kilogram body glued on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests on a variety of materials, such as glass, teflon, and paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "easily detaches from the wall," says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
“This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe yes, but the researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, given that nano carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented a hair-like microfiber adhesive that self-cleans dust during movement on an area to ensure perfect and consistent adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juices.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because thirsty and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital medicines, alter the absorption amplifying or decreasing depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in boxes or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he is launching a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange juice and pomegranate to reduce the risk of patients.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized for being responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had reported the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mix and to be careful about what one drinks, if one takes drugs such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT THAT THE PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the Public University of Milan: "These findings are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the informative notes of the drugs.
It is always worth reading the illustrative papers of the drugs you take, and, if something is not clear, do not be impressed, but clearly address the doctor or pharmacist," the expert told the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize in Economics for Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written in a New York Times article that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that unleashed many polemics, and that was reproached to the economist for years, but now proved to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist,” but also a very aggressive “style publicist,” particularly critical of the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to the public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less austere interface, to more important ones, such as the compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new standard ODF format (Open Format)
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful, for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphical development module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical graphic of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration between multiple people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the preparation of texts, because each employee is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some of OpenOffice’s features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they are expected to issue the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and adds to the English version that had been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation cd can be dispatched at home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to spread it in the homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office next attempts the great challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word equivalent video writing; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint rival presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Goal for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
This is the site of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on the Kohl test pieces are part of those carried out in recent weeks, by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to wait two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl’s positivity at the third generation EPO was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus refining the shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES QUESTIONS IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times is concerned about when it devoted a long article on the topic of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the Nordic regions are both those where there is "more integration and more work", but also "a strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Lega Nord".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
not only.
Even the Lega’s new legislature to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
"Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market is not experiencing a crisis
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the tenant union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin must support," explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase has begun for them.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free, unregistered, no-rent-limit contracts, sub-leases.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of taxation are needed to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Bande Nere area), to an average value of 800 (Lamiate area, Udine, and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), one asks about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
One can only save if one moves away in the peripheral areas:300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed you need 300/400 euros, for a single one you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, it is necessary to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the city economy.
Lastly, in cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by extra-community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent demanded from foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities touch the historic halls.
Historical cinemas close in favor of multiplexes.
“A city without movie theaters is a blind city, it is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates well what is happening in the major urban centers of Italy, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of the marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the large multi-rooms, and the death of the consumption of mono-rooms in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems to us inevitable and indisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
“It is as if one of my friends disappears, someone we know, with whom we have shared a long way and so many emotions,” observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the potal grand prix of the jure of Cannes, and who was always telling the story.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and it is the halls of the main cities that have mostly paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, the Roman Emilia is at the top with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the missed deliberation of credit in favour of traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame that, ethically and morally, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would require between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas monorooms of historical centers and peripheries.
Among the normative provisions, there are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic area, and will have special rates for parking lots and in some parking lots.
"This is an initiative I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna implementing other measures.
It is obvious, however, that to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important for me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had already thought about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much with shared emotions, I turn to the other side not to see the panels blackened by dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the City Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy accusations are made by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, to the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controllers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already sentenced for association of criminals of the mafia type, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," wrote the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to Ma<0xC3><0xAE>tre Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan - the judges write - to enter officially inside the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also a lot of politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest.”
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, following which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
As early as the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditions between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the SUD at the time of the dissolution, was appointed head of a center-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He cried out to scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of manipulating everything for a political matter, but given the incarceration request signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
From the ordered interceptions against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from waves, now the big ones are launched.
This is a disproportionate deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the major global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossi like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now try to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has now been studied for a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the environmental forums and the new increase in oil are giving a big boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity demand could be covered by seaswell operating systems.
That would be twice as much as nuclear power plants produce.
And in addition, there would be currents and tides.
Colosseum to attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a real revolutionary step.
Two years after that, more and more candidates among these companies always dedicated to traditional energy rely on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," the spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and it is evaluating the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question involves obtaining a permit deliberately issued by the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to lead to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush set up a project for further excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the path of energy from the sea, and the amounts invested to this day, although their details are not known, indicate observers indicate a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, on the grounds that marine energy does not dispel fears of environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a superior environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a buoy system that connects to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the sludge up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through undersea cables.
At present, we have four such systems in the project phase, awaiting a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Greenant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a mall and parking lot using six underwater turbines of New York’s East River.
The movement of water during tides turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced that it has a long list of customers awaiting the necessary permissions to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for the Research of Electric Energy, deserves at this time, the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine, and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, invested $7.5 million in 2008 and expects investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
