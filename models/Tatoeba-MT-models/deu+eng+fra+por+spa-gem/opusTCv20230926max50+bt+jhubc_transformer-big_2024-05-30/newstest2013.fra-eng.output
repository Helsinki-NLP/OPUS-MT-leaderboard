A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama’s Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It was in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws from 2009 onwards that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on polling day and deprive citizens with a judicial record of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such an ID.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not possess the required photo ID.
Much more.
Students, voters considered more voting for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their institution-issued photo ID.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to registering about 10 million citizens.
However, measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
The same was true for Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, whites who made up 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undeniably make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the supportive nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious goal of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes present incorrect results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This makes men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests even more hesitant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who did not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that we have between 30 and 40% more chance of having metastases if we are not screened.
So I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
We really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer, offering them the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not harm long-term life, and instead opting, in these cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria for deciding who should or should not be dealt with are precisely determined.
I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if you should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, we could prevent 30% of cancers.
“If no one smoked anymore, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This greatly harms people’s health.
“Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after cigarette cessation, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
The weight
Obesity and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer.”
Feeding
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
The meats too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one observed a decrease in prostate cancer risk, another noted an increase rather.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Taking a screening test doesn't give cancer."
The Higgs boson scrubbed
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that this is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain.
Suppose, however, that it is the Higgs, since the chances of making a mistake seem thin, and let's see what it is.
There is, in this lower world, a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot end up in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly consisting of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens named fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at any rate, not for this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all beasts as exotic as you might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light particle" that is the "message" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field at that precise location, much like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" arises an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore, one of the "power-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with this difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, that must be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, one must reach very, very high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond from which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring in circumference! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful in explaining the relationship between Higgs and mass.
It is not all particles, or all materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold of itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, hold) do not.
Now, what "can bring" all this research, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancy between the observations and the predictions of the MS.
There are also many who eagerly wish to find them, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and block some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (up!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-up!).
But such gaps have not been found at CERN until now.
Impacts
The repercussions of these researches in the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. All-the-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
At the beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers at Bell Laboratories had no suspicion of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They envisioned scientific applications of it, but nothing else.
In fact, the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed), in 1962 - told us already fire, at first the laser was seen rather as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the search.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although not at all his original intention, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and earned him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die... <0x7C> The Duty
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is expected to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
Much remains to be done in this essential area.
The Duty tried to look at it more closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that gnawed him had left him a two-year respite.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," said he, half-fig half-raisin, lying in his bed at the hospice of Victor-Gadbois, of Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even to eat alone.
Attacked in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, talks to strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
“My biggest wish is that I’m cured of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"During our lives, we learn that a man pisses standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Regressing to the child’s stage, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the person’s ability to accept regression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments unfold at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and stifled".
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
"I don't have any wishes in life anymore," she says, before accepting that she is put on a mask to help her breathe.
In the coming days, however, she expects a last visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provide body care and food assistance.
These are palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether in terms of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When dying, you will agree to provide mouth care for brandy or Pepsi, as required.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died overnight.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help loved ones as much as we help patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but are not the same.
Alongside an old 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family gathering in the courtyard, well held in his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
“For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” Martel said.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his or her life, whether at home, hospital or care home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Greater Montreal Palliative Home Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that causes several physicians specializing in palliative care to fear the passage of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care leaders including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before agreeing to euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients will only ask to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are angry with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard’s hopes of survival were already minimal when she gave up on challenging chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was stopping fighting, she said.
Yet she told me I was done!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for failing to comply with their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are reported to be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to sleeping the patient until his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This report was made possible through a journalism scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, fundraisers from political parties and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about a formidable “system” that mixes building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been crumbling since the big deal was made," says Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec City and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the misappropriations related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to backtrack.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and corruption of officials.
"Since the investigation began in 2010, the transport ministry alone would have saved $1 billion on contracts," some referring to their instincts to get a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will manage to "demonstrate the schemes behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the police of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, have allegedly led the "sewer cartel" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of having pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
In addition, engineers at the Montreal highway and contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, are formally charged.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
For years, he himself paid 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who was donating the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed in all winds in the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts which he inflated the costs
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption was functioning well.
Gilles Surprising, a former public works engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totalling $736,000 from construction companies, in exchange for sewage contracts which he raised costs.
Other road officials have admitted to being greased by inflating bills by 30% to 40% by fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately shutting his eyes on a parallel budget fueling his cash registers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first women elected in Montreal to sound the alarm bell.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and sold... 1.6 million to developers, in full real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will eventually be put in place, says she "pulls on a thread to understand how the system works, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the offenders."
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
The wound is being cleaned, but it would take a dedicated Montreal investigative unit and a watch to avoid dubious practices coming back.
How we do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected aware of the scheme", when they were not immersed in the trick!
Estimating at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironically: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but this will not change the situation, according to him: "Until we strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocated a complete revision of the system of awarding public contracts and funding of parties: "We cannot go lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own courtyard...
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season, you have taken a new toll with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I progress by their side.
The technical staff also helped me a lot.
Every day, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And, in a match, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not inflamed.
From my beginnings at the pre-training centre of INF Clairefontaine to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recruits of this summer are used to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Carlo Ancelotti also contributes a lot to my positioning.
He is supported by deputies like Claude Makelele, who was in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course you're not.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has great experience and has won a lot of titles with high-profile clubs.
He has met great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a reassuring conversation with him.
I was coming out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you think of the first season of PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of leader.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the club’s goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen from now on.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We first want to finish first of our hen, ahead of Porto, in order to be able to receive in the 8th final return.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this title.
Last season, we didn't get far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, has achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It is normal that we expect a lot from us given what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it’s certainly a bit frustrating.
I wonder what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team builds over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer in attendance.
Watch Manchester City who has not been able to qualify for the 8th final for two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
With regard to the amounts invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won.
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much for saying there's a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and puts a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and he proves he's the star of the League 1.
He proved everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This drives others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabbing game time.
I saw things there and I came out reinforced.
Today, I manage to make good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized with the Blues.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine and we must behave exemplarily today.
What do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don’t want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) snatched, on October 16, in Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without the banks
The exact opposite of current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files peer-to-peer.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of $30 in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around about $10 (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin stands out from other types of virtual currency such as “credits”, used to progress in a video game that is earned by playing or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, every time, a central authority controls and processes exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes in the network are both account book custodians, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually done between two email addresses in the way of an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner of which, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a phase of file hash, i.e. of transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "cutting" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other being orphaned because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to a hundred millionth, leaving some margin.
The difficulty of the challenge is also noted with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not concern the protocol itself,” said Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payments company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Major actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, “giant salaries” were launched.
“Three thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of an educational book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who says he has thousands of users.
There is a general movement of questioning hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, in the event of a success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to retake possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is above all the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be tolerated when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, took place in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles joined Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban raids on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and bloody due to the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved these days.
Former Mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban join in a desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen, seizing government lands to sell them into building land to returnees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They disregarded themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosities: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have faced the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with the reconstruction of provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, removing the post of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
No industries have been restarted, no dams are in good condition, no major irrigation systems are repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
It was reported that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to take hold of it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already nearly left the copper mine in Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the vast Buddhist site and remain the province’s largest employers.
It will also take some time for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to return to normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: high school for girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win the hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, has carried out, and carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation.
This work, which was greedy for local labour, was able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in arable areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which the farmers told me they wished, a small, well-controlled civil aid that directly affects them would have to be maintained for them.
A constitution with forceps in Egypt
This is President Mohammed Mursi's new poker shot.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its all.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this House an additional two months to complete its work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusions", continuing to "betray his word" and "trample on the right".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time forced the Brothers to renounce their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as protest rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote in favor, as he claimed in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this use of a hasty vote is an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I retain full powers", these are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent assembly, the vast majority of whom are Islamists, voted on the text yesterday.
Most Liberals missed the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, feeling that they had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacing members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it was most often unanimous votes on the articles.
Commentators were also amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, with some members of the committee considering that the constituent's clock was misregulated.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 remains the same as in the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a pledge of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” reply the Liberals, who see it as a blow of communication.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" temperament Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, eds.].
And the question may arise in the future as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are markedly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred on the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Neither will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as demanded by human rights associations.
They also express their concerns about the text, which they deem liberticidal.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no article echoes the protection of women, notes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will parade them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has chosen five main reasons to visit Israel.
Go and adore the holy places
Make yourself a must: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptism funds" will be touched by divine grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is in this very place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk along the Rue de la Sufferance or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the Fortress Antonia (the Pretorium), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Anointing Stone and the burial.
This is where the Christian center of the world is located, a symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Lamentation Wall which constitutes the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave small words with prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of Masada Fortress, an ancient enemy refuge built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit all of them during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First: the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It exhibits mainly the paintings of the impressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of mouldings of visitors and guardians of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures by Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which reviews the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars are shining.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three major seaside resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Please note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure water contains brine and very easily holds back swimmers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are of surreal beauty.
It comes to perform a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative sludge and to cure various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to stroll through the narrow alleys that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who came to do photo shoots from all over Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar equals 3.8 shekels).
When it comes to urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only subway line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
This is almost an underground funicular.
The trip in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturdays.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop.
And the work week begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, scaleless fish and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
There is a multitude of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, ground chickpea balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs wandering in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-nourished cats that walk the proud air.
You can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars at night.
These cats love past places and do not refuse to be delighted.
Car rental varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Admission to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who has a language, goes to Moscow": migrants save money to learn the language
As MEPs and human rights activists dispute what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling “fake” certificates have already appeared in the country.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to make money to help their families stay home.
Since 1 December, a law has come into force that stipulates that each migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
At the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Immigration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
You will need to validate your Russian language skills in order to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained educational certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Peoples' Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take exams in every city in the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it do?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, the representatives of the migration service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work".
Many are talking about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will torment themselves for months without food and without paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised something, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken their passports, and they do not get the salary they are expected to pay," said Tolib Charipov, head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the migration service in Tajikistan.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many Central Asian republicans who wish to make money in Russia trust that they not only do not know the language of the country they wish to go to, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families don’t even have enough to feed their children, not to mention dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people go out to make money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will only be for migrants with legal status.
Without statute, there will be no examination or official work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason: administrative barriers and still language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then, one can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have fake documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They are asking us for 100, 200 rubles, of what to buy cigarettes, tea," Umed Khoushkadamov, a national of Tajikistan, told reporters.
“Get fast, don’t lose, and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language exam certificates have already been confiscated by Federal Migration Service employees.
Fake papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not take them for nothing: every migrant who hoped so to facilitate the task of exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of the government and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper pieces".
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first stroke exam time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian weapon carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it was the shooting during weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the use of rubber bullet weapons in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a gun permit from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s committee for security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168,000 crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking arms commands
The first is "military trace", that is, weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stockpiles and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of them have often suffered explosions.
"Verified versions indicate that some fires were deliberately triggered to conceal the deficit," he said.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers are for something.
“We see private arms factories that do not compete on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow,” one expert said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," the former military added.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Study.
Experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "by fault of employees whose work is related to weapons," the report explains.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5% are from “underground excavations”.
A salesman and consultant at an armoury who asked to remain anonymous asserts that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these underground search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, he says, sellers will pick up new goods from military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, for example a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the merchandise through a fence.
“He transports it to the city and sells it for €900 per unit with two chargers,” he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a check purchase from illegal arms dealers," the seller added.
"As in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I consulted websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered me to come to the Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "coin" to bargain.
The price of the gun, I was given on the spot
Victor Baranets as military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, says the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you have to come also saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to pass on that his daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give them to him.
The little ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he said, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want".
“I thought I was in a luxury shop,” recalls the soldier.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we go with the seller in the forest and install a target.
“They let me shoot and when I’m convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating,” the expert says.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," it said in an advertisement on the website, "Buy a gun or a combat machine gun."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to the miners?
"No permit, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast an immense network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People rush over food like hungry wolves and then find themselves mining coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, Observer and Former Military
I have heard of this type of schemes: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take control.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a Weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself without guns and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast an immense network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
“People rush over food like hungry wolves and then find themselves mining coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a gun", you can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half to wait.
It came out of long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes has overall decreased in Russia by 7% and amounts to 22.9 miles while the cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs have decreased by 7.8%.
U.S. fast-food and supermarket workers on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier job at McDonald’s
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will increase or shorten quickly.
These actions are supported by unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Alongside the rise in modest wages for basic workers at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the demonstrations want to see the creation of unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the “Black Friday,” as a pouring rain of sales grabbing millions of people hit America and sometimes sparked scrambles.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their positions to organize strike pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting guns to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid Walmart employees only shop at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products due to the low salaries of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or handheld scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanded an increase in wages, complaining that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who gets $9.5 an hour, it’s an amount he can’t afford.
Scientists at Berkley University in California have shown that if Walmart raised the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That’s 1.1% more than what it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred the entire wage increase to consumers’ shoulders, every run in the store would be 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the stores from 8 o'clock in the evening to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over that period 5,000 items per second.
His cash registers made a total of 100 million transactions for Black Friday.
Dan Fogleman, a spokesman for the company, said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that “less than five” Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was just a “com’ operation among so many others” on the part of the organising union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were not about Walmart stores either (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, so they are not there yet) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s advertises selling billions of portions and after they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you for the work you honestly did!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 an hour.
Fast foods increase over time, but few, on average, its core employees in New York are getting $8.90 an hour.
No one in this city touches them less than they do.
It's inconceivable for me to live with that money in New York.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald’s after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, there are comments on the Wall Street Journal forum saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue were demanding that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, a multiplication more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters with bullying or layoffs.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a trade union, seizing fast food remains a difficult task, and for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They disagree
Other tumultuous protests were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including that of City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's announcement sells billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the work you honestly did!"
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including Mayor Bill De Blasio who said that "we must all support fast food workers so that they get a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized the event as the most important event the fast food sector has ever seen in its entire history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, not to mention that not all were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult for now to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small.
"At the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain."
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the director of the group of interactive 3D technologies of the Microsoft lab in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time try to broaden the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment to the pixels on flat screen and sometimes to the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What does the future hold for us as well?
- Although the Kinect has rendered the physical interaction, a lot of things take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information input has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for now, not really.
We’re trying to change that and we’re working on real 3D imaging systems running on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out into ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
It is appreciated, but isn’t it overestimated?
It cannot be said that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of their actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, in order to control the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-carried bracelet that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this can?
You would do it with speech and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or can't do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you don't like about modern cameras?
Are they lacking resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is the current generation that we rely on in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be nice to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to the algorithm designers.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche of our Redmond lab gave the touch of the sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 <0xCE><0xBC>s, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but I don't need to touch, to have more frames at the second.
Shouldn’t we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a usual visible field sensor.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, to play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone with your hands up is not practical but here is what I think: the best option would be a "transitory" augmented reality that would allow you to switch from a cloud platform to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that is what makes their strength (the personal elements are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem that opponents of this idea point to: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing!
What answers is your group preparing for this challenge?
In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image medium.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really meant to assign palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of your fingers.
There are also wrist straps that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
To make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still one task underneath which it will take a long time to struggle: the way to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that they are walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (not to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain, there is still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to the city dwellers who are at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city’s border and have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that you can see near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the trendy parties and vernissages.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always gather crowds, no matter where they are exhibited.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical Petersbourg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands a barbarian organ and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role by his existence, his philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you walk around the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a designer specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even though in society, everything that is not grey provokes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were located.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I began to befriend the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchchina which gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be at the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must gather.
In 1995, I took a seat in Pushkinskaya-10 which was home to a music and art club, a Bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg Bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy playback songs in tight jerseys, they included Igor Vdovin, nowadays fashionable composer.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg hosted a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his basic training and education was with us that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as regulars.
I am a hero of the past century, of the times when culture meant something.
In 2000, a press poll was held: it was the "The personalities of our city" award.
I was named Painter of the Year, and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong topicality and acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's scary to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything fades away, the tragic falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the clothing that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit on him in the trunk instead.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- Recently we saw you as the organ player of Barbary. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else besides me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be neat, delicate, liqueur.
A disintegration of culture is occurring.
Before, people were divided into herds, supporters of Bohemia loved one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and in the end it is less management, money, everything is decaying.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with paintings that are usually the ones you paint at the end of your life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
They say: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow today, there are good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are out of the way, because we need higher experts who will correctly assess these experts and pave a way for them.
Currently, it is the "kingdom of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time growing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that’s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Scholarship
Birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with Earthlings on board go in search of a planet of rescue.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to live our species in weightlessness or on a planet of relief?
I don't think there's much of a choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
“It’s about Venus and Mars,” says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500.
We can only live there at very high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, we were experimenting on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from Earth varieties.
Then insects, small breeding drosophile flies, were put into orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed in weightlessness.
At the exit, we get a completely normal chick.
It is then that the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chick has to find a support, he has to get on his feet and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
Unable to find any support, the chicks agitated disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We shot them twice and then gave up because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” Sychev said, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological “miniature ark” with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, biosatellite "Bion" will only ship species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. You have to do this kind of research," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
Nonetheless, it is not yet possible to make reproductions directly in space.
It's not a small business.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is able to do so, in principle.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thought, it is capable of creating a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the feminine organism is the most precious thing humanity has.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would stand after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
“Nobody answered that question,” says Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired rocket and space sector officer.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, having been in orbit twice and even worked in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must look for new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts train to extra-vehicular exits.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but nevertheless a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Since the baby develops about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's womb, it is easier for him to get used to water afterwards.
This is logical in principle, because from his birth to his first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the newly born child weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on the birth simulators.
Of course, you can prepare a childbirth in a special room, the woman will manage to get him out.
"What then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite us to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the terrestrial attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
One cannot dress an infant like an adult with a special suit for training.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case, imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, who is completely disappointed," predicts the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings will travel on their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their space-born offspring.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institution of Control of Public Finance) said: "the control of pseudo-self-employment (in Czech " <0xC5><0xA0>varc system") has failed because of the politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it lags behind in its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Institution of Public Finance Control, said in an interview for Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its enforcement must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking in us,” Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
As an example of abusive practice, he cites Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' approach to the " <0xC5><0xA0>varc system".
The Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG would not bother contractors with controls; is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government can't stop an authority to go and inspect to demand compliance with the law," Kala said.
At the control committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was it really about?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation and a proper practice follow it.
We have put all this together and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, some very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be "strenger and better", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not sufficient to continuously develop more and more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote itself to the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what results for you?
A common control of this kind should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not really have a positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the market thresholds, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork that those looking for its flaws will find far more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
As for the institutions, similarly to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is organised similarly, it also has a council constituted a little differently, but these two institutions proceed basically in a similar way .
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, but with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it therefore also has audits of this type at the level of the various Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which at home corresponds to state resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities in our country are checked at the level of the Länder's auditors.
When it comes to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have comparative data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we see as a model, is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage of cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant to you as an institution? Are its effects already felt?
As this amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do checks a posteriori, we have to count on a certain delay.
Our observations concern, for the moment, only the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched a new "risk of mismanagement" instrument with which we have screened nearly 14,000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been amended and the conditions for certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
So do you see the adoption of this law as an advantage or an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulations, the claimant (e.g., the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) compelled the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the market law constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law tougher in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal errors without impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the prime minister said that the SDG was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system – what does that mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to go and inspect and demand compliance with the law from acting.
He can declare, “We will change the law and allow it,” but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing happened.
The procurement law has relatively strict rules on the formalities to be fulfilled, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a tenderer is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are frozen in places, but most of them are still walkable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were walkable this morning, but in places that were frozen and also snowy.
Temperatures have fallen and oscillate between -5° and -10°C but they are expected to rise slightly in the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the area and there is only a thin layer of snow left in the plains.
However, the ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né hory) are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service indicate that, due to fog, visibility was reduced in some places.
The R6 highway and national roads in the region are now easily accessible.
Vigilance, however, remains to be put in place, for example on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There are still remains on some of their sections of frozen snow remnants and in places crowded by traffic.
Especially in high altitude areas, drivers need to be vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Highways and Highways Directorate reports on its website that certain roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by ice formation and that traffic-stamped layers of snow may be found on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in high-altitude areas of the Pardubice region.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on the departmental and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed by traffic is present on the roads in the areas located in altitude.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather will be cloudy, but mostly dry.
It will blow a soft wind and temperatures will generally range between -3° and +1° C.
Pilsen (region)
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practicable, although, in some places, increased vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions are necessary.
It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, but visibility will improve gradually.
This is shown by the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway is practically easy to use, but road communications services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The lining of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the South Pilsen district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third-class tracks are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on the less busy roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to high-altitude areas of Olomouc must now count on a layer of thick, soft snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the pass called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>, after the chemical treatment operations.
Snowfall this night forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field; according to the road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
In other parts of the area, most roads are easy to walk.
" On the heights of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district there are remains of snow.
Drivers driving towards Jeseník should expect to meet at the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass a layer of thick and soft snow, "said today to <0xC4><0x8C>TK the head of road maintenance services of the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also visited the area overnight; they said that after the chemical treatment, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc roads are easy to walk, but in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk drivers should be careful in sections of forest areas with wet roads.
Regions of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, Northern Bohemian Road Maintenance Services reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice na <0xC3><0x9A>stecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero in lower altitude, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the southeast of the Bohemian Central Plateau, there are, on the contrary, no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, particularly in the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow melt during the day, clear sky and freezing during the night.
Difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec are also reported from the main roads.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Kninice is due to branches of trees that bent under the weight of the snow until reaching the road.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band The Tap Tap, we’re laughing and thinking that we’re the only band that can collect some positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you start a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charitable activity that we have been preparing for two years now.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the late Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11 a.m. 10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20, three concerts will be held simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end practically by the time the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati which lies in the Pacific Ocean, in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who got that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think together, with the public, about the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled "The end of the cancelled world" (in Czech "Konec sv<0xC4><0x9B>ta zru<0xC5><0xA1>eno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it at these charity concerts as well?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also join at some point as part of a completely unique live show on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák who also plays the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other celebrities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We endeavour to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will be the benefit of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on in the framework of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, with the Tap association, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to get to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers come on stage at each of these concerts?
What criteria do you choose?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Suchý will be on stage.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; here too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the home of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it seems at first.
We have five members in an electric wheelchair whose gears must travel in the hold, of course we also walk a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has more or less always gone well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything went smoothly.
Through your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we witnessed in Moscow that in the east all are still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible for people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association is being created to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things that we are still late for.
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities participate actively in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what led you to create this band in 1998?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play saxophone, among other things), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
It’s true, building connections with well-known singers and working actively to promote the band has helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the grants from the European Union, we can, moreover, allow us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: anything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural...
But pity is totally useless, because people with a disability are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity on.
They are people who can live a life of their own and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with a disability manage to achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them but for the whole society.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think that's completely normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
Only one, Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We are an open group, people come and go, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or want to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the planned day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012, starting at 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, Brno in Fleda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
In the late evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relays when the Tap Tap song "End of the Cancelled World" will be sung jointly.
The purpose of the concert is to raise financial resources (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training center in Prague at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, ticket pre-sale is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in a number of ESA projects.
However, the route from Poland to space began much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles were working on spaceflight; they did not always find understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the lecture of A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
The said Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagandist of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of the world-renowned astronautics, his contribution was rewarded in particular by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
In 1925 a draisine was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the drasine.
The only known information about this draisine is that of the press at the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It is clear from the documents retained that this research had reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric rocket, drawn by engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were conducted by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronautical society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company was mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal Probême, which contained four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these papers, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and as early as autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed just under 5 kg.
An improved version, RM-1A, was subsequently built and, in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2 were begun in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and weighed probably 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was halted.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first RM type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the Aeronautics Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision has raised a strong debate in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberalist-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (wage) create a strain on prices.
Under this term, the following meaning must be used: a producer endeavours by importing goods sold at low prices to withstand economic competition by "making" the price of the competitor more expensive, with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increasing his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, buying at low prices, or disappearing. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, the social burdens of the State necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so publicly known that there is no need to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital into their homes.
In other words, governments place their own population at the mercy of private capital without regard to social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to force its own population economically to accept the price diktat of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is due on the one hand to a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other hand to the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour legislation.
The result is increasing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In Germany, for years there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is already counted by millions.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay an additional fee to reach the vital minimum.
Such a scandal has been updated, for example, in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the southern EU member states undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to either emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with miserable wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day their country will invest in private capital.
We have to ask ourselves the question: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or else a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, to get tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and even today, according to its own selfish interests, govern politics and by it the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby present in all States.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the development of bills to law firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills were then passed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as Western constitutions state, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalist democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book "The Crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompeii": "The state was long in decline and functions were attributed by violence.
The bribes, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold"...... "The honest people did not seek to obtain functions at all, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls".... ' It was really said that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a man in the ésic.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, today's society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard to the interest of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as in the past, is a decadence without precedent of the elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses of human lives, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and internally, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing will ever come out of the violence and will never be able to,” Sting said in the song Fragile, whose main verse in the chorus is “let’s not forget how fragile we are.”
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be wars,” said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing for its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a standpoint "behind the curtain", on the one to which they mainly benefit from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (as of the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small chunk of Middle Eastern countries.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others come from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely the group of individuals, who is the chief instigator of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is above all the history of a struggle for power.
In each era, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions according to predefined objectives.
We must admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration of certain powers has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among the families possessing astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude him).
Little is written about them.
Of course you're not.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world’s first news agency (Reuters) to end the linkage between their names and serious criminal acts they were involved in, which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortunes, or both.
They have major holdings in almost most of the world’s central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of the Russian government of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the central bank under the control of the Russians.
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of central bank at the Bank of America of the Rothschilds and began to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I understand) and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 as he wanted to file a lawsuit against the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a 33rd-degree initiated Freemason, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to suppress colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution, an absolute one) and,
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and still lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid the repetition of crises such as the ones they caused in 1907).
After succeeding in triggering the First World War by assassinating Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier start of the Second World War, the bankers let the politicians create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany a number of far-reaching war reparations, thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it is then enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the culprits, proposing simple solutions)
In the late 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (back to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held him; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel ignited a fire fire that could provoke a Third World War.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people divide sharply between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where wrong causes another wrong in a circle of endless violence and where the greed of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world is found, at the origin of everything?
Here we have to make a distinction between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as with us, international bankers only offer their own candidates to the people in the elections.
The current naval prime minister of Israel is a typical example of a world politician's fascistic destruction, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to the country's accession to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc....) extend to become a global conflict and, given that Iran's wide-ranging control of the world's economy, the world's long-running economy.
In what light now appears the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their view, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to bear on their hands or foreheads a mark of red iron, so that they may neither buy nor sell anyone who does not bear the name of this fierce beast or the number of his name.
One must understand: that he who has common sense counts the numbers of this fierce beast.
This number denotes the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When everything goes badly, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters made up of Islamist students stormed the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
This was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed heavily to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped the embassy.
After complicated expeditions, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a rocky cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a filming team who came to search for a major science fiction film.
Combination of genders
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan demanded Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
This is part of a realistically designed political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful blow, a betrayal - as, for example, in the Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
The atmospheres follow each other: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the era of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
A ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting has ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It is also the first film by Affleck that does not take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above the Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo, where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake shooting crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that actually offered few exciting scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
He does very well, he sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is dismissed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the landing strip is quite pulled by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their roles as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have earned a bigger place and they are not, far from, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it shows itself with moderate interest, enjoying the realization and retro style of the 1970s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in some way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the job.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to launch the contest of the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has recently been considering adopting a 40 percent quota of women for the management of large European companies has been at the root of our decision," Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey, told the Právo newspaper.
Among the absurdities mentioned is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they objectively pose a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers, solely because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance, or the Directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to the increase in the price of chicken cages.
Criticism has also been expressed in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term "spatting butter" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic is currently imposing demands from its banks by threatening to use its right of veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the root of the fact that in the Union bananas must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonizing non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables have been eased despite opposition from some States, claiming that the existing directives result in food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that must include on inflatable balloons a warning that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to an American survey according to which balloons are, among toys, the leading cause of death of children by choking.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
We also have weird ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the liberal economist association "Let Me Do", the Bankovnípoplatky.com server named in this investigation, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants interesting.
These ideas, however, originated not in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea makes us handicapped.
In the autumn of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time, Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), said: “We are going to ask the European Union for a reimbursement.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and as a result of the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had ended up with full stocks which it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The grants for obtaining grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by the Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), these were, in concrete terms, to be used to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: “Bizarre regulations are rare.”
While the regulations are often criticized in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and its general development are rather commendable.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration but have been imposed by Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (the fight it does not always come out victorious) sparks strong emotions among the Czechs.
If, after six years of battle with the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", with regard to the name "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, we find today in the company of world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the Lübeck pastry or Parma ham, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carps of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> ("Poho<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC5><0x88>").
Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice horns" ("ho<0xC5><0x99>ické trubi<0xC4><0x8D>ky") can also be proud of their community trade mark.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," said Senator Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how did we come up with the idea of running for the presidential elections?
It's not being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn’t be a candidate anywhere.
But I can’t bear to see how the country has been looted for the last twenty years, that thieves aren’t locked up and taxes and retirement ages are rising.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, then I try to come up with a solution to make it change.
And since I am over forty years old and an independent member of any party, I have no other way to influence the situation than to run for presidential or Senate elections.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set out for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who have chosen you?
I've always said that I'm going to fight for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Subsequently, I clarified that if I were elected a senator, I would run for the presidential election.
My purpose is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we are laughing at the bar or in front of our TV set, but also that we are trampling on those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition, the press breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I bribe journalists or that I have been the adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You have begun the struggle for the Castle with the themes of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK].
To this end, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, pushed for tourism guide activities to be a free profession, I gained momentum.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or right with a good project, it is knowingly rejected and it delays the citizens.
As an independent, a member of no party, I have a much greater chance of getting the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma supporters, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself a man of the right or of the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people place me on the left.
For me, whether it’s a little left or right, it’s not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or SDGs, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone says you’re a populist?
But does not what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimum purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without the support of the parliament, you only have slogans left.
You won’t survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, for example, you will succeed in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other choice.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
Eventually, they should explain why they don’t want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, which was achieved through public pressure.
I admit, without a doubt, to be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just got into politics and I'm trying to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make a difference, so I went to see a number of personalities asking them to run for the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fuel fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote and what they did did, for the most part, gave their voices to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don’t have time to check if the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don’t have the financial means to do so.
I also don’t have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand in my “transparent” account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about $60 million.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in a car, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
Are you driving in Aston Martin, have a patrimony worth $60 million and have no money for your campaign?
Do you want to change the Republic but don’t want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I be indebted?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that my program doesn’t attract much interest.
I have no obligation to pay this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, paying my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I wouldn’t run for any elections.
Are you going to continue your business so that you can live?
Didn't you say you'd put your business on hold?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will be in charge of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I still win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that true adventures are not just about imagination. To convince yourself, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large neighboring company, tells us: "Yes, this building is indeed very beautiful."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the internet, an iPad and e-books.
Nowadays, no one willingly goes to any of these fiddly libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather peculiar record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty small miniatures of painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
Thus the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam MVRDV architects’ office, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of spirited and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual flame and presented himself at the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a laugh on his face.
And while the jury members were still looking at each other, bewildered and shrugging their shoulders, Maas stacked his books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech backed by activist arguments with a: "Common dear!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain sprang from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and semi-detached houses for a total of 50 houses.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus this dull little village, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of awe-inspiring ugliness, whose white facades invite us to think that they house a dairy, has been enriched with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you walk the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant street lights speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
People are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing balls.
And everywhere books, books and books.
"Normally, the library shelves are located along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We completely upset the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been aptly arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical power station of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panels, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircases.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened building architects and engineers do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, said in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in a Frisian farming company an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, the one millimeter thick synthetic membrane has been used as a substrate in greenhouses and fields for years.
It's cheap and you save time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be thrown away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal humidity level of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology," Trouborst said.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only lights up for a short time inside, even on days of good weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted transversely with respect to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade serve as a sun screen, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "finally found soul."
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the voids of the library that was not yet completely filled (today, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
According to architect Winy Maas, “there is nothing worse than a half-empty library.”
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Even though it may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against Palestinians’ request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
What's wrong with that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not too critical of Israel.
In the March 2011 Libyan uprising, Germany also chose to abstain from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany having difficulty adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore clashed on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find this role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Britain
What does the term “normal” foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national cases.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to clash with public opinion, but also with the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive factor.
However, I would not place too much emphasis on this, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is, at any rate, a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain from major votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I think the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions about the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
The United States has vetoed with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows a great deal of understanding for the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, of course, the government cannot defend its position publicly.
I believe that the true differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Is Germany struggling to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand with the position of the major European partners on the other?
I don't think it's easy for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They therefore cannot be part of a broader political line and must affirm their singular position.
This is what they are doing now in the euro issue.
In my view, in the future, Germany will take on a locomotive role and push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been a delicate one.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international stage, does Germany only want to take on a key role?
Or is it still having a hard time taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If, for example, we look at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it's always the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to deal with neighbors and very varied opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this void, so who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and they're less appreciated for it, it's life!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo...what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing its name cannot file a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she would win the case.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a firm specializing in property rights violations in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few additional letters to register their trademarks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a workbook containing registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by taking part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his contenders charge him to tackle the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a denomination that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
This is the term for women who marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch said.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to data from market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the world’s third largest luxury product market and the fastest growing.
However, it is not easy to delete dubious registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports on the trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long time, the denomination criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist because it would have hurt his brand in China.
In this area, sometimes the law of the jungle dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the buyer of Volvo, used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of that of BMW, and the dispute was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost to plagiarists in Hong Kong and Singapore who had redirected the famous crocodile’s gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, last year, the office reportedly went from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a restored normality".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition proceedings would have fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were reported to have been closed, an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nonetheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Acting is expensive
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the OTC received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, nearly a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is at the top of the ranking for the tenth consecutive time for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each record averaged 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese plagiarist.
Of course, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault because surnames cannot be protected in Germany,” said Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office therefore rejected the objection of the Munichers.
Freudenberg has won in the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is a must
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nonetheless, he adds: "The procedure is lengthy, time-consuming and costing us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs, and the Archives Department has even had to review the events of the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered the opposing party in vain a “large six-digit euro sum” to settle the dispute.
“That’s how we see what it means to us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from this region were to ensure the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it had still been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Vigilance is a must."
Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they say, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should instead "register also in China everything that is likely to be protected," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs can be much higher than those of the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of its legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, you hit your foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, pumps for ladies and moccasins for men look for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano -, they enrag, enchant and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
It is Monday evening, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers between the ages of 23 and 69 have come, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man in the household.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every choirist has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Being helped to help each other
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros for less, you can become a sponsor.
This money guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "story teller" or "praise singer".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this area, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has repeated songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany and now returns to its home region: South Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, lies Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest straw or dirt huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, one can observe on a smaller scale the ills that plague Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction of the risk of infection by half.
Over 40% of the Swaziland population is a carrier of the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in their mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis mostly saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without a school degree, there is simply no prospect.
At first, there were only a few people who personally pledged to pay a few euros a year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a warm meal a day.
But barely a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that since then deals almost professionally with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
The pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blenorrhea often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, infections related to chlamydia, trichomoniasis, (fungal) candidiasis, blenorrhagia and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany; however, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, the rate of chlamydia-related infections is significantly higher than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been decreasing.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is a one-tenth decrease from the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who frequently switches sexual partners take regular exams.
Most quickly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, the donations, but especially the funds that the choirists reap through their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well accommodated, with one of their grandmothers for example.
The gogos, as the old Zulu women are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school on time every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals each day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the support of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many residents.
This is not self-evident, because although the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo topic.
A King and His 14 Wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it's a topic that touches sexuality."
This is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned morals, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found on every corner of the street, Annette Lennartz adds, "but hardly anyone uses them.
Culture is different, flesh for flesh.”
In order to encourage some cultural exchange, Imbongi choirists travel together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the Black Continent still know during the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is such a sign of gratitude that it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears a few formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choirists visit their godmothers.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
“Go to Esitjeni, you’ll find light there,” the people there say.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers in a bird's eye, back in Heidelberg, in front of these choirists who step foot in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The layer of ice could reach 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet constantly dipped in the shade.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters and can go up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that may have struck Mercury.
However, no one makes a connection between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains Messenger chief scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other life-essential elements have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small gaps through which one observes the infinite.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union term.
This detail from an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the birth hall of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where stars are born, dubbed "W5", a rather unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope has photographed the blazing glow of a dying star.
The donut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birth room.
The Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen with the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope puts more emphasis on colors.
In this infrared photo, the Helice Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned it the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo allows to observe a spectacular hue.
Only infrared detectors from the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest mysteries in astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any traces.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs ever taken by the Hubble Telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the shade, photographs of spiral galaxies can become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust trails divide the shining heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the first cosmic carambulage in the constellation of the Serpent: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two fusing galaxies rush towards each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope has observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don’t like technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname of “southern fire wheel”.
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula lies 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary domestic dust.
This photo was made from optical and radiographic images taken by different telescopes.
One can see the circle of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also permanently create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our gaze on the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its peculiarity is due to its great light collection capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capability is close to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with the “Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI) by leveraging the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They featured two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru Telescope and IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows us to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of the distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the mission began.
This photo illustrates the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope’s mission will include finding light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe Mercury’s South Pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data has been showing the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country where you are still relatively young at 97.

An investigation into a country where you are still relatively young at 97.
The trip to the Talysh mountains is of a fuzzy romanticism.
At the turn of the many turns of the road, the small bus cachots along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it would almost seem like in the Black Forest.
But here we are in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group called Talysh lives, about which little is known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town boasts an overly aggressive Soviet-era architecture that does not match the picturesque mountain scenery at all.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one track.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
We can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region that are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120.
Having another child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The man was said to have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he still conceived a girl.
Would <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov have been mistaken for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the man in the great Central Asian age.
“Surprisingly elderly people also live in parts of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz explains, “in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is true that the people of the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tour guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a bun, whose contents she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, among them one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
There are also two little children in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hide long braids of a dark blonde that her son reveals to us with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who has ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not experience the distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, an amount that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-graying son is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The “Rights of Man” Failed in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The draft Sharia-based constitution is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not greedy with words filled with emotions.
We need to make the transition successful.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he told state television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also especially for Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Mursi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his “in order to save the revolution.”
However, the Egyptians and the world don’t really know what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written in haste by the mostly Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night tower are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word “principles” really mean?
This was and still remains a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case, a newly introduced article suggests that, with regard to all matters relating to Sharia law, the al-Azhar University is to be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radiance radiates throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will oversee the legislative system, which would de facto result in the placement of the judiciary under the supervision of the judiciary.
Many points in the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the probable maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts worked to suppress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The government must also protect the true nature of the Egyptian family and “promote its morality and values.”
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
In other words, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi is submitting to the vote and which, in his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians "very soon".
"The Revolution is Reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, promising to bring down the Sharia before it comes into force.
“The revolution is reborn and we are going to win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft constitution is “to be thrown into the trash cans of history.”
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
“If he proclaims a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoneed," Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member, told Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was being held in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
“Clean our country!” they asked Mursi, saying that “the Koran [was] their Constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Mursi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft Constitution, along with its supporters, had spoken loudly.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot box in which direction the country should take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompass all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood while in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new constitution," he regretted during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers,” Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could pay off.
A protester in Tharir Square warned: "You give birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
The Rakfisk of Norway: Is it the most odorous fish in the world?
The five million people who inhabit Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the locals for an extremely smelly fish?
Take some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of the most popular foods in Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this ubiquitous smell permeates the air.
Rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness sets in and it is cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavite," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also known as "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavite to rakfisk,” adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it’s not bad – it reminds you of sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, fish was immersed in airtight water barrels and then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - undoubtedly with the senses diminished by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted to full employment, high wages and a complete health care system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, albeit fragrant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not displeasing to it.
People here are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot down 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about the "July 22 incident."
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their own could have committed such a barbaric act.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
“But oil isn’t the only reason that justifies our success,” explains Anna, our waitress, with blond hair and eyes of a piercing blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray in her hand.
We are, as you say, prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money out of the windows, during the years leading to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the cords of its stock market tight.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"Not to mention the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and queue to buy myself food - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger made up of momentum, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I stay in is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the most smelly of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of aquavite abuse.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nonetheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico’s economy is doing well, thanks to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is plagued by a drug war that has already killed about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Before joining the American president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populated and sprawling state that enshrines the capital. On its preferred land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The locals attribute to him the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of cracks.
Plaques bearing its name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are counting on him to bring about lasting change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more blatant.
Hidden beneath the motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight drug gangs that ravage neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on the edge of a landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Pena Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place infamous for the number of innocent women killed there.
The critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to curb the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in the face.
In a concrete house, typical of this decayed neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Se<0xC3><0xB1>ora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the corpse rigidity had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old commer, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and to be silent.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made promises that he will make it his priority during his term.
"I hope he will be as good as he was when he was governor," Olvera told Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the abuse claims that Bradley Manning was allegedly a victim of during the detention.
The trial concerns Manning’s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. military history -- has missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have undergone during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense filed a request that the Manning case be closed on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning expressed his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday’s hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers had completed after meeting Manning during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he received from his guards was “excellent” and that the treatment he had received within the prison was “very professional.”
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concerns about certain issues and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they did not record the issues raised.
“They wrote ‘no problem’ (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn’t mean I didn’t raise any problems,” Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status amended indicating a "risk of injury".
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to be removed from this status ... so that I could enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Marine Corps Base military prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept aware of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the regulations.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so that they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after he was forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard's order that he should let go of his blanket that could have concealed his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let go of it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his pants or flip-flops to injure himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences during his detention and that he will considerably reduce his sentence if he is convicted in court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning is considering pleading guilty to the least serious crimes and fighting for dropping other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors arguing that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defense.
If all charges are held, he is liable to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says Mexico-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two paths: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which queue to go to.
I grew up in central California, where I’ve been called the “Mexican” all my life.
This is an ethnic term, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irelander," or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian."
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that my grandfather was born, there is no need for special qualifications or a bond.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle an interview in one language or another.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and headed to the "Foreigners" queue.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons that pushes Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory in writing at the tip of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans harm their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to talk about bitterness?
There are a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person had a typical profile -- dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that it is the American dream we are living, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they sneer at us as if we were individuals of a lower strain and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexico-Americans, as Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexico-Americans are upset.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as wealthy ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country to visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to do it alone, amigos.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican Americans still want them the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmmm. (chuckles)
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is vain.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropolis, and the holy city.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full change.
The Arab Spring has blown everything apart, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up with this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to think that it could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire granted on November 21 continues, fighting this week has strengthened supporters of force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will boast of forcing the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has suffered a beating.
Having killed some of its leaders and pushed Gaza’s 1.7 million people into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of its Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might think that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a burgeoning regional power, once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has taken cause and cause for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members rejoice and say the Islamist crescent is bending around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its dominance, through Syria, where Islamist-inclined rebels can overthrow Bashar al-Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily relying on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as an important player that cannot be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel’s hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been boxed again.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being the source of the latest wave of violence.
But most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who completely ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, notably thanks to the separation barrier encroaching on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and protecting Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more warlike party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the beautiful part.
Why spoil these fucking Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they were to lead the West Bank, wouldn’t they launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of the head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win; but it may be that the Arab Spring changes the point.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire which is a good omen -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder canister that is destined to one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, short and short term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to stop the flow of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in line with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming proposal for a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
This is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This involves a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packages have come into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of sick organs cover the dark green packets which are all identical, regardless of brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in fine print on all the packages.
It is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has pushed against this law.
Tobacco makers said it would boost black market trade, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
“Negative consequences will arise from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said the law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrific packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in Australia's high court.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 of them to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only boredom, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the slice of population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV ads, sports sponsorship and the obligation for resellers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local businesses and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you’re working in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the must-have place par excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noticed an increase in contributions from some lambda citizens in favor of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the time to make a video, or is it an agency-orchestrated marketing campaign?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulations in force rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos mandatory on packaging in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know them.
"You take a cigarette and put away the package," Victor El Hage said as he bought a package with a picture of a tumour in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'll be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the “King of the Pack tobacconist” in central Sydney, said the uniformity of the packaging made it difficult to store the packages on the shelves.
“Before I needed an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours,” Yu said.
“The government just had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, okay, we stop and put the key under the door,” he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines, and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise boredom.
It’s perfectly normal for us – and our children – to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to nourish creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly facing several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
No, I don't.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that's not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back a long way," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After scrolling through numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "wanting to do something but failing to embark on a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though he would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two can be related, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” which was published in the journal “Perspectives on Psychological Science” in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened on cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the room next door, the too high sound of a TV show that had no relation, others just heard the TV show, and the third group didn't hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard low-noise TV said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this focus problem to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or staking task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, "like looking at objects on a montage line, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that when you twist or scratch, these gestures, often considered to be signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigote learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain unmoved,” said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocorded voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Disposition to boredom Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, “Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blown away.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teens said they were bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
Three percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the boredom percentages today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “teens are a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” notably because children and teens don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Badness is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he will not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to take care of himself or himself, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation moves from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant bubbling that activities and technology generate is the goal we should aim for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
“In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and soccer player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and material that could be used for its use - minor offences, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado’s vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the location than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been classified without consequence.
Police have stopped indicting adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana as the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative constituencies have called for accelerating existing marijuana cases and continue to indict people who own it.
At the same time, several cities from Denver suburbs to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana stores in their neighborhoods.
“Things are changing so fast that I don’t know what the future holds for us,” said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police at Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a permit system, authorizing the production, manufacture, distribution and sale - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first of all in therapeutic use and now in personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
Washington's I-502 law comes into effect on December 6, leaving a year-long legal vacuum, during which the permit system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
In the meantime, practical questions remain pending: how to balance the state mandate that ensures proper access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis retailers within a 30-km radius around a school, park, playground or nursery.
“There will be no places more difficult than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis sales trade, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently formed research group Cannabis Legalization Center.
On November 21, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an email to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" would no longer prosecute people aged 21 and over who own small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop indicting people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said police would enforce the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the "district attorney" Ken Buck embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to handle marijuana possession cases, primarily to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those individuals who committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," Buck said.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas like Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana-restricted use initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer have adults appearing for possession of limited quantities.
The county prosecutor’s representative, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to dismiss all cases of marijuana detention.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
While 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a legal and governmental framework appropriate to personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
“This is a cultural barrier” with prosecution officials, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent a good part of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so they struggled to accept that it was legal," he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are on the verge of becoming a case of jurisprudence for drug legalization.
As advocates and state officials envision a new legalized sales frontier, they are awaiting the federal government’s directives, which still sees marijuana sales and cultivation as federal crimes.
Advocates for legalizing marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite some media arrests of patients on therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to practice in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it’s true that police aren’t likely going to push through the doors to grab small drug bags, there’s a good bet they’re opposing licensed marijuana retailers for personal use authorized under new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration policy adviser.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana stores, even if this is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose that ban next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where someone is granted a permit and then we find ourselves facing a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only today’s students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of knowledge, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheater that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
Yet two weeks after moving to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson stated with faciety that I had left after being forced to drink in cracked cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been bullied and bullied.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I have been persecuted for only one reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I have been the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a partisan of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about this today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students are undergoing the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s student room (JCR) said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted” because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, which was devoted to student politics and portrayed the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
One of them was student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who travels to Rolls-Royce, wears a silver complete and moves with a chrome-headed rod.
In other universities, Conservative students say they are being treated like scapegoats in setting up higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "there is a growing left bias in universities.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center-right.
“This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members,” she said.
I was the only one to think that way during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and with a paralyzing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of reduced funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the host week, when the new students got to know the others and the professors, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I found that teachers not only participated in the sarcasm of Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy about striking minors, privatization and the government’s opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa was engraved in the woods of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I experienced was a translation into English of 18th-century French texts, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I've lost foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustular face, was easily upset.
“Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons in your spare time -- well, if you're not too busy making friends," he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that evening, I sat alone and felt a slight slap on my shoulder.
It was a second-year student of English studies, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's the case.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most of the young Tory pretend to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagree with everything that Mrs Thatcher had said.
This scheme has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took over the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They beat each other, don’t they?”
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who was teaching at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I began to shuttle between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded family and city friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreaming bell towers.
Even my communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Fatigued by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a working session conducted the following week, when another history professor seriously suggested that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Inwardly blushing with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents’ brainwashing and called them “old madmen.”
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who pushed the last nail in my oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed stuck in my room, and after five minutes, my prosecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a weeping chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, who not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: A Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: A Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the highlight of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest fashion designer of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of time-honored beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
Even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, hasn’t forgotten the couturier’s charisma either.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
“He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concludes.
Parade of nobility
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves people well-educated and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium of sixty meters wide that offers to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to scroll on the podium to admire a "dreaming audience" wearing the main creations of Valentino, such as the tailor Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage to Aristote Onassis, the "Not mana" and the costume in Vita.
Among these models, there are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of her clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember that perfectly.
These were a trousers, a shirt, a "gillet" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his femininity, his great love for women, and because he sublimates our beauty," Feria said.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot, either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Eventually, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bustier and a drop-out neckline.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the dresses of the couturier with the utmost care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that she conveys.
The “King” of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier calls his seamstresses this way) to make this ivory silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve different kinds of lace and a four and a half meter trail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the late twentieth century, "the return of high society customers".
Obsessed for years by the "knowledge" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of his clients.
"His refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance have always jumped me in the eye," admits d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The hardest job in the world: human mules by Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living carrying the sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the earth's entrails solidifies in contact with air.
After harvesting large rocks of sulphur, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters altitude, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a tortoise pace, keeping balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a mistake could cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, they make their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and painfully carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 meters altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, we can say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip," explains Anto, who usually travels three times a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is triple what he would earn in the fields.
“The miners’ income is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the bearer who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned close to his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindu's, and I've been to the Java's.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah Ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill despite covering his face with a mask and wearing special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than acceptable English language.
Strangled by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the job of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wooden masure with other wearers, gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop pouring out at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater lighting up with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not receive a sub of 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) per camera surcharge, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for animals, not humans,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent wearer who has been working at Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, can only carry 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away, via a goat trail invaded by weeds.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Unainik says, opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the human mules of the Kawah Ljen volcano.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans throw responsibility for this lack of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, do our civic duty and give your life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint pellets, but despite that, or perhaps thanks to that, the video spread like a dust slice on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a chicken in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the issue in a fun way through this advertisement.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill “their national duty.”
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt it was a theme we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing pheromone perfumes or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we said to ourselves: what could be more creative to solve this problem than making it a rap song?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its leaders’ conservatism and strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
Why do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy for the National Population Division, says it’s due to “better education” and “wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and building a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms contributed to the increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decline in population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound in scarcely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese people who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore experienced its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoeboxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoeboxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If so much of these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they will not have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that’s why people put it off,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to have my money and my time,” another 20-year-old told us.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as reasons preventing them from having children.
So, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is about the quality of the private domain or "the domain of privacy that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for people under the age of 16?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, who are frequent web users.
In four of the cases, they associated the term “something very personal” on a personal level with “password and username” when they applied it to social networks.
“I’m not going to reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says Jorge, ten, as he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone,” he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I won’t share one of my photos or someone who would do the fool,” he said.
The boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are from the family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're responding to me, I just post them," he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends in a quick way,” he says.
He said he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of José, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not knowing 20 of the people registered on his friend list.
“I’m not worried because we have something in common, like music,” he said.
According to the boy, no one gave him advances or asked for his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply delete them from my account,” he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberbullying are no stranger to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
“He only put it on a private profile.”
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I were angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyberbullying," he said.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, English teacher and Licensee in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she said.
Porras reports that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master’s degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book “Natives and Digital Immigrants”, uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
It is the digital natives, children and young people who are born with technology.
“We, we’re the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we’re learning ourselves,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, “because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what to disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so.”
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents privacy is to use questions that make them think.
“Tell them not to do it is useless,” she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you do at any moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, the same must be true on social networks," she said.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and education counselor, said it was essential that parents read the terms and conditions of use of social networks carefully.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
UNASUR summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the United Nations, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be leaked after the close of the summit, and then claimed that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian government's website.
When questioned about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief press statements.
Journalists' access to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, limited audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulated among the journalists was that given by the press attachés of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document leaked during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of South America and Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, although this was promptly requested by the press, it had also not disseminated the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the obtaining of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that settles a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ’s decision to hear the pleas of both parties in Lima’s trial against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are bringing today before this international court," President Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals," President Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era said, shaking hands with President Humala, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
He read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He said actions would be put in place to improve “cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for improved accessibility to medicines, cheap access to the Internet throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters.”
With Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphant matrix but should help increase our productive matrix and envision a better future for our populations,” concluded President Humala.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were pertaining to Peru and were on the transverse axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours, is another topic discussed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through an ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all of these pathways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to witness the takeover of the new president of the country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Similarly, within the framework of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the UNASUR, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the pro-tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example over Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "were killing each other during World War II" and other conflicts, "but they were now almost a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by UNASUR member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President expressed his support for the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories to the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who knock our ears off never compromise anything, conversely, we South Americans have all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington with US funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed its principles, but has instead respected its "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, “there were justified suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish court, which has demanded that he submit to interrogation in his territory over a alleged sexual offence while "Swedish law itself allows this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
“It affects anyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the granting of a safe-conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he stresses that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the enclosure of WikiLeak.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings with different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted safe driving as early as tomorrow, it would be over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation fully permits, and as it has already done in other cases, would question Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or question him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as an advocate of press freedom and said what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that hurt freedom of expression."
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists paying for greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed that this is not the kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than highlighting his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution in order to pursue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay within the UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should stand firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality "this would destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the willingness to move forward together.
We need to solve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and affirmed that it is "beneficial for Latin America to take international proceedings if the two countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it may be."
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to running for a third consecutive term, he noted that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primaries, he would withdraw from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
“My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I won, that would be my last presidential term and then I’ll retire from politics.
If we lose, I will too.
“That’s my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez’s new medical treatment in Cuba.
I just talked with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean a relapse of President Chávez’s state of health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when the test result was confirmed: HIV-positive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make it "less painful," in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to find out about him and his fierceness was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the civilian hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he ended up in 1994 after numerous battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first cases reported, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the appropriate time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva.
Infectionist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS rates were no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of immune system allocation patients presented at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not using drugs up to a rate of 200 years:
To put it simply, it means that for someone who gets a positive HIV diagnosis at age 25, “as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,” the scientist said.
In order to put this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of AIDS-related deaths has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths as of May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I think the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years at least, we have never missed medication, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or else they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, we must offer screening tests in a massive way, to all those who ask for it.”
Specialists and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffered from a can't of Ka's disease.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better if I’m going to burst three times a week,” they say, not me.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To date, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
“I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person,” says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, through his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of World AIDS Day.
If they take the test, the sooner they know if they are HIV-positive and the better they will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that you can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packets of a hundred, that's fine, but as a result, even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, says the journalist.
It proposes to redirect this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold at the counters, but that they be found in the distributors of public toilets and in places that young people frequent.
This is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"It's not how sexuality works, it's best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he said.
Numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The State is the 4th state in the country in the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of contaminations are sexual, 6% are blood and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case there are 4 or 5 people who are unaware of it.
A judgment ratified by a U.S. court on appeal ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, which sets a precedent for all domestic companies with branches in the neighboring country and with solvency problems.
It seems, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the June 15 ruling by Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s leading glass manufacturer to sue the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the case judge points out that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, sitting in New Orleans, asserts that the main proceeding is formalized business bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the inter-company vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
In addition, what is certain is that, since there were still the votes of the subsidiaries, in any way the Vitro creditors who fought against this in the United States courts, that is, the "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have won the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A fact that was omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation it has been in since 2008 without stopping the severe economic crisis facing the United States, which has remitted costs to the country.
For now, the González Sada family company will appeal to the same appellate court for the vote to be held in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance remedy will claim non-prosperity and require review of the trial by a higher body, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which it detailed Vitro's proceeding under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that it liberated Vitro from agreements signed by both countries to bring it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-part carpooling: they assault Vitro and they assault the country.
Overall balance sheet
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were silenced for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Aviator Pilots has already encountered problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied that it provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic about an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw 198 million pesos from the F/589 trust of the bank IXE on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They besiege the Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend at a University of the Caribbean amphitheater, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad opposition front at the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of Great Wall Country products, with a housing area for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the Southeast Zone to oppose the monumental project, which is partly in protected areas and represents the largest of all threats to industry.
Acta is dead
The government has put forward a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under his English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well done that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was seen as an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex
In order to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the real estate developer Homex entered the stock exchange market for 500 million pesos.
This issue is the first of four issues for which they offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Birth of Competival
Incorporated by the leading IT companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, a new consortium with Competival as a corporate name has just been born, whose objective will be the clustering software services market in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The basketball globetrotter "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage sentenced him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, national basketball team player, manager and head of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the federation.
"I have worn several basketball caps throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit to Primera Hora's home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs that remind him of his extraordinary itinerary, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves the most are those that remind him of his time as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"It was my best years, the ones I took the most advantage of because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
It's been many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired at the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was a leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a strong player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
That’s how Mincy started, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended to me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He rejoiced in the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's duties on the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the 1989 Pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and where we would have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn’t made us play the last game again, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the one at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and we kicked the US team, which was pretty similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 because of a problem.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as did Piculín.
And that without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team consisting of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work that Leo Arill does.
What is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been part of the national team's most glorious era between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of compulsory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
I usually listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played a scrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on that Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her press secretary Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to everyone who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
“He was an exceptional person and he was living life thoroughly,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis with Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he had been diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television as an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an alluring genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two comedies that stayed shortly on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his film roles are critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars wagered on.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screens and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot her.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to detain his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R,” Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled this Friday Hagman as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each and every one of us, who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is in the works, the channel said.
So far, neither Warner nor TNT have disclosed how Hagman's death will be included in the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who was famous with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on stage in New York theaters in the early 1950s and served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s ruthless memoirs).
“I didn’t write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I give them back confidence, I come with them when they come to have surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer them some comfort, like “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a little while, but it’s going to be fine.”
He has also been an anti-smoking activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "end of the world" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing there an irresistible hook: the end of the "great count" of the Maya calendar, December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited him over the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax gulf that some have dubbed “the Armageddon of Debt,” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end-time theorists thought the apocalypse would unleash.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University this week.
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and tell it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only professor to give classes on "the end of the world" this semester, which will theoretically be the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the “Media, Culture and the End of the World” course.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared to real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled "The End of the World."
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn’t disappear,” Restall said.
Despite the “imminent disaster”, students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work “until the very night of the supposed end of the world,” Restall said.
The courses proved quite popular.
“It was complete in two hours,” Restall said of his high-level student course, which consists of 35 students.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of Revelation, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, claims to have watched all of the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us to believe in the end-of-the-world date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it,” said Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old West Chester senior student at Temple.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused such speculation to flourish.
“In other places around the globe, people don’t think about it,” he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew we were giving classes here on "the end of the world".
“The Philippines are not participating in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, there has been talk of the many supposed last judgment dates, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us they thought they were going to "end of the world" parties.
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
