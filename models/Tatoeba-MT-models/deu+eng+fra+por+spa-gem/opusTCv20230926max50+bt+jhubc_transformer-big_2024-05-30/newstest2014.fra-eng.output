Spectacular wingsuit jump over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination equipped with wings), it went up to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many badgers had gathered to observe its feat.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners are struggling to find the money to repair the declining highway infrastructure, many are seeing a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches itself above the dashboard of your car.
The aircraft, which record every mile traveled by a motorist and pass on the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to reshape the outdated funding system of major American roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of major-axis planning has suddenly provoked a heated debate and busy alliances.
Libertarians joined environmental groups to pressure the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you travel, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The tea party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concern about privacy.
And while members of Congress can’t agree on whether to continue, several states haven’t waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of drivers have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental ride.
This is truly indispensable for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which predicts that the state will start recording miles traveled by every California driver by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded by taxes Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more than a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently had tracers installed on 500 cars to test a mile-by-mile payment system.
“This turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage usage fee.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as taxes could be used to change driving habits in ways that reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
Reason Foundation free market supporters also appreciate the idea of paying drivers on the mile.
“It’s not just a tax going into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The move is also supported by two former U.S. transportation secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the mileage path.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would cover about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to their work or to the city.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the country's most important experience.
These drivers will soon pay the state mileage charges instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is attempting a trial on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer drivers recently equipped their cars with an aircraft, drivers were worried that the government could follow their slightest actions.
“The concerns about Big Brother and things like that are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
This is not something that people want.
At the start of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site, "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily goings and comings.
Nevada is among the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would let the state know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, the citizens will be more comfortable.
Research into this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California startup named True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not meant to help motorists paying taxes to states.
It was looking to break into the emerging car insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she is testing have pleased the planners of the major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
“People will be more likely to do that if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive ways and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all state residents.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide “pay-to-drive” insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them," said an urban planning document.
However, some transport planners are wondering if the entire debate on mileage is not simply a huge diversion.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unreleased Listening
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, released in January, he concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unreleased releases.
Four have already emerged on the web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone pants.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dated 2003) and too rare public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to make the pop scene sparkle.
A feast for its fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one lap in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke plans to re-release the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This re-release, titled The Next Day Extra, will feature three albums: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously unveiled clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe edition, five specially unveiled songs for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both the discs, but also the accessories supplied with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, most importantly, he gives a taste of his new Atomica track, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars far ahead and rock electricity skillfully mastered.
Unreleased Already Listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a troubling intro before a luminous cavalcade that gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John’s Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in his element anyway when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again makes reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, enchanting, make you want to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun playing chameleon with these titles: turn-by-turn informant, man on board a rocket, potential Martian...
He conceals and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the Louis Vuitton Invitation to Travel campaign, whose new face he embodies.
He will appear in one of their commercials, aired from November 10th.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not meet the army's "universality of service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadienne, including one of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a Reservist from London, Ontario, with PTSD, has been released from the military despite his request to stay for another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case came after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not comply with the rule of universality of the service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are unfit for combat.
Under current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal veterans spokesman Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to “this shameful practice.”
Disney is putting on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to favor tablets over its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie’s Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its mobile and tablet app.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is only scheduled for 2014, the Disney Junior division’s statement said.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a western American city where she makes the order rule with a magical lasso.
Each episode contains two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature for children today," said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are becoming increasingly important.”
A poll released earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of under 2-year-olds have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of under-8-year-olds, compared with 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to 'cooperate' with Germany on US surveillance issue
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for the U.S. intelligence services, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he enjoys the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts has been obviously positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as an escape and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he believed that support from the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will make it possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been put to the test following complaints that the NSA had listened to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States," it should be taken advantage of.
German Green MP Mr Ströbele posted a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be “safe” there, he said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “serious and sustained” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have deemed the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public benefit.
The letter makes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been solved".
Cogeco Cable Could Soon Offer Interactive TV
Followers of Cogeco Cable may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their TV in a future that doesn’t seem so distant.
The Cogeco subsidiary said Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,” Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet explained in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus follows its competitors, like Bell, even though Cogeco’s subsidiary does not yet have a precise date with respect to this new platform.
“We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail,” Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable companies to make its service available through their broadcast platforms.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay pay for services on a pay-per-view basis.
"It's been about two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy major chain packages doesn't work," Audet said.
However, he hopes that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"From these discussions, a new kind of framework will need to emerge to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," Cogeco's Chief Executive Officer said.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry this spring.
On the earnings side, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82<0xC2><0xA2> per share.
This is a decline compared to net profit of $44.9 million, or <0xC2><0xA2>83 per share, from the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the U.S.-based Atlantic Broadband cable distributor for $1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based internet provider, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
Net profit for its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was $43.9 million, or <0xC2><0xA2>90 per share, down from $45.7 million, or <0xC2><0xA2>93 per share, from the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of customers of Cogeco Cable is up 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about the number of clients fluctuating in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with intense competition.
From horse to beef products
Horsemeat has been found in cans of beef products sold by two small, low-priced UK retailers, the food hygiene agency announced today.
Routine testing revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA up to 1 to 5%.
“Because horsemeat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been in the product,” the agency said.
A scandal about the presence of horsemeat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people early Friday on Highway 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a driver driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car arriving in the other direction.
All four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic had returned to normal at around 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them as they descend from the plane.
The new hand luggage charges apply to bags stored in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would pay $25 if the fee was paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was set to incentivize travelers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she explained.
Airlines began paying for first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as much as they could in the hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in those compartments.
These charges are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said the new fees wouldn't really be used to collect money.
It’s about making it clear to the most loyal Frontier customers that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a Border gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and check-in procedures are changing to ensure passengers are aware of these fees before arriving at the gate.
Frontier Hand Luggage Fees will not be applied until summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often rumble about luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider adding luggage fees as a sign that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them did not pay the baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other airline imposing such fees is Hungarian airline Wizz Air, airline consultant Jay Sorensen said, which closely monitors the additional fees.
In a December 2011 report, it estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage costs amounted to $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the gate as passengers discovered the airline’s unusual hand luggage charges.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career,” he said.
I expected to see gnashing teeth and a fight break out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “passengers boarded at the speed of lightning.”
Frontier also makes like Spirit and charges a $2 fee for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Border said passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who drink coffee can be reserved for free.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to pay for the drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Frontier’s decision to charge a hand baggage charge when passengers do not purchase their ticket directly from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half of the loyalty miles to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut miles premiums by 25 percent on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and she loses money.
Revenue fell 9% and its flight capacity fell nearly 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempted to rectify Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA Calls Internal Error, Not Hackers for Site Failure
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that had caused the crash of its public website for a few hours, and not hackers as some had claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service (DSD) attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the crash of the NSA site through a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The formerly ultra-secret NSA, a time nicknamed the “No Such Agency,” has been in the spotlight and heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications monitoring programs at the national and international levels – which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the agency and leaked by the former NSA’s disappointed Snowden consultant.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked a lot of speculation that tonight’s incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta City Centre is now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building has sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people were working at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let down its employees.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, and employees were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," said Félix Bisson, Regional Director of Labor Relations at Delta Hotels.
The closure of the Delta is taking place in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Either he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, Transat Tourism Chair holder at UQAM's School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be implemented within two years.
Titan CEO: "Goodyear Amiens Purchase Project Starts With Zero Employees"
After threw the sponge in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear site in Amiens-Nord promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American pneumatics Titan, today declares himself ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced this, Monday, October 21.
After giving up on the plan to buy the plant in January, you're back today.
You spoke of violent attacks and insults, speaking of “so-called workers”, who “work three hours” a day, of “crazy” unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turnaround.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save some of the highest-paid industrial jobs.
If I've hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of taxation and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when working eight hours in other countries handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, people work 10 to 12 hours a day.
I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with a correct price and competent workers, it is worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the plant was announced, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance allowance, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys the closed plant from Goodyear.
Titan could then move the machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
Now, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among Goodyear’s current 1,200 employees.
Therefore, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for CGT and Goodyear to seal a severance allowance agreement for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to secure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we give lifetime guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg can get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier profit declines as aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc., a Canadian aeronautics and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% fall in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in its Trains division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also failed to provide in-flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious schedule of commercial commissioning by September.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it only flew three times, and the question was then whether the test phase was on track.
Results did not live up to expectations and share prices fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from “outperformance” to “sector performance” due to low potential for the stock market to rise in the next quarter or two quarters.
“While the drop in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We expect Bombardier to register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is modest so far at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 firm orders before the commercial commissioning of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was moving ahead on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's downtime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and schedule an update period, and that's what we did.
This will happen again throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier has indicated that it is evaluating the timetable for entry into service and will provide further information in the coming months.
“This slowness in flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues declined slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aeronautical manufacturer said it had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, up from 83 before.
The delay in the Aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, a figure unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, said the division’s revenues had increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Transport's order book totaled $32.6 billion as of September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division have suffered from execution problems with some large contracts.
Leaders have announced that new directions will be provided during the fourth quarter.
The share price of Bombardier, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc., would sit on the board, fell 8.5% to $4.83 on Thursday afternoon.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest aeronautical manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, said on Thursday its quarterly profit was down 10%.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists have been missing in a chasm under the Tooth of Crolles since Thursday night, it was learned Friday from the Speleo aide de l'Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one experienced in practice and the other not, had left underground on Thursday at around 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We have not heard from them since then, the same source said.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to Speleo Relief in charge of the rescue organization.
Dozens of people on site
Twenty rescuers, ten civilian members of the French Rescue Speleo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
In the late afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It's another group of cavernologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Hunters were found "exhausted, but not wounded".
They lost themselves in the network, returned in their footsteps while waiting for relief, the prefecture said.
Recharged, they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday invited its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo the day after new revelations about the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo’s search engines and messaging until further notice,” she said in a statement.
According to the Washington Post, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," said Michael Konken, president of the union which claims 38,000 members.
Re-painted lights: MP asks Brigitte Grouwels to resign
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' plan to "relift" traffic light poles in Brussels is not for everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport on Thursday launched a test project in the centre of Brussels consisting of repainting 16 posts of traffic lights of the region in the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The aim is both to “increase security” and “Brussels identity”.
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all Brussels traffic lights, at an estimated cost of around one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Brigitte Grouwels is not content to spend the money of the Brussels people madly on relifting signalling poles in the colours of the Brussels Region, but is continuing its operations to flamingo the capital," De Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally painted herself in dark yellow-blue-black the posts of Brussels.
According to the MEP, there is now "no longer any difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
Brusselsers deserve better than having their money wasted by a CD&V minister who runs the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse from Flanders.
"For reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2,245 votes, which is 0.5% of the Brussels people!" concludes Mr De Bock.
the Portico de Pont-de-Buis dismantled
The portico ecotaxe of Pont-de-Buis, around which took place Saturday a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived at the site shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national road was diverted in the meantime.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax porticos in operation in the Finistère department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers who own a prototype of the Google signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a headphone, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of microfibres or an in-ear earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with correction lenses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father left the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "frequently" it.
There is no recipe, no instruction to go through the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, lying on the night table.
This is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found her body empty, crisp on that crimped bed of hospital linen.
Likewise, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the thin glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small apparitions day or night, a little shy, a little erased, it quickly returned to my mind, evolving as it regained its place in the landscape of my thinking which thought itself to be in mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had in no way lost the person of my mother but simply a woman I did not really know, a woman who embodied that person, during his stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and released the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This detour from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside as outside," he said.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he got old, sick.
I wasn’t afraid of him anymore and I could love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was scared, when I got hurt...
He talked to me, constantly encouraged me, he inhabited my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me with my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don’t know who said that the deceased are not the forgotten, but the invisible.
My parents are no longer there, but I always feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week for sure.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only there is always one thing that keeps me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes some dreams carry me on the contrary and fit into my story and actually they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he was smiling at me and rejoicing that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to signify to me that he was sharing with joy what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I am delighted to share this common memory lived after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused the young bachelor I was at the time.
Nevertheless, I realized my grief fairly quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and being interested in the Middle East, to the point of making a master's degree in a large school, have not been, in retrospect, harmless choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I sometimes think about how she would want me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and righteousness of the person who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes resting on me.
My mother passed away nineteen years ago now.
He died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers itself, anywhere, at any time, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time calmed down the pain.
Only lack remained, this empty, unanswered, this need of her, to confide in me, to reassure me in the hollow of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes resting on me, I see the dark circles that weigh his gaze, the fine lines around the lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile again, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the dark when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a bit reached.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the shrinking of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to stay on the path she had drawn us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot tear it away from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I was unable to attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in accordance with his vision of things.
I also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep from it and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don't know if I adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is that genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
In short, he is there every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It’s almost 30 years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6.
The immense pain that then invaded me has, of course, eased but it is still close to me.
Very often it "landes" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even sadder to find that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he replied "I'm going down" but in such a real voice that I woke up in a hurry, anxious and turned on the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I am sociable with a job of responsibility, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad on Friday released official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We’re not telling the world to stand by us and support each other, we have the right to ask the world because we’re part of it,” Al-Maliki told Washington on Thursday.
And also because if what’s going on in Iraq isn’t settled, it’s going to expand, and what’s going on in Syria is going to expand too.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They held up signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide assistance.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years imprisonment by Liverpool Assistance Court.
A top defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his drug-related activities after being compromised because of his cocaine habit.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals to be a "prime matter", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officials spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Bar Dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and on her credit cards.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought unlawfully to obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were monitored by police at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
Along with 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, as well as more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared his drug addiction would be exposed.
Today, at Liverpool’s Assize Court, Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, fell into disgrace after being convicted on two counts of impeding justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators tracked the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing 60% pure drugs under the lawyer's trash can in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, which is home to the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drugs, and they phoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet, and on her credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine. He said he had spoken to the suspected drug trafficker because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege".
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During an interrogation, he said he owned an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that clients sometimes called him home for legal reasons.
But the court heard testimony that it was calling on major players in the drug trade, some of whom it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “If anyone has to know that you shouldn’t break the law, he’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of overly engaging with private clients.
The relationship we're talking about isn't just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary boundaries of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He hindered the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored her.
He got too close to some clients, particularly Scarborough, and let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any unlawful conduct and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, "Mr. Ditta has gone from criminal lawyer to criminal himself since he started getting drugs from criminal organizations."
His cocaine addiction compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the back-thinks of the senior members of organized criminal groups who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that confidence and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation of Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of three counts of cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in the trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking have been sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta hosted a question-and-answer session about himself in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin returns to the stage in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on Dec. 21 at the MotorCity Casino Hotel's Sound Board Room.
In November, Franklin began recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the illness she was suffering from, the famous Respect interpreter had told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She says she’s happy to be back.
Chin reduces the cost of its Christmas illuminations
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered with a coat of light: one could close the hot flash in Menton with the bill of illuminations.
An invoice that, unlike many municipalities, is also regulated by taxpayers, not trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the network of street lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the perpetrator of the shootings.
The incident occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travelers and staff rushed to the exits or onto the tarmac.
Police intervened very quickly and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is under evacuation and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five saynetes imagined and performed by artists from the region, vignettes with a high dose of humor, we allow teenagers to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Société d’art lyrique du Royaume will return with its lyrical destinations, a formula that now fills the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists from the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the lyrical Apéro, the benefit concert held last August, with the support of the color soprano Marie-<0xC3><0x88>ve Munger.
It was a benefit activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit to produce a balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears as an air of The Bat.
Without delivering precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday, in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future looks good, even in the long run.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"The finances are floating and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a milestone that we will take in seven years," he said.
"I would even say beyond," added CEO Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy de Surrey school faces six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Mustapha Hassan has been accused of hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, wearing a weapon in a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will appear in court on Friday.
New class action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new collective appeal was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that took place this time at the Saint-Joseph Oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The petition is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Submis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph Oratory, where he was serving as a Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first remedy was only three establishments, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us: "I, I was in such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both remedies.
The particularity of the class action that has just been filed is that it allows the addition of complainants from any institution where abuses could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the congregation of St. Croix and the oratory of St. Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exerted a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they were "knowing about the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless chose and embarrassed them".
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the Sainte-Croix brothers’ lawyer, Mr. <0xC3><0x89>mile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The class action must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Superior Court.
Once admissibility has been admitted by the Court, the second step is carried out, i.e. the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of St. Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
Major Fire in a Trade
A fire severely damaged a trade in Montréal's LaSalle district on Thursday night to Friday.
Rescues were called around 1 a.m. on Friday because of a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The 30 firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took nearly an hour to master the fire pit.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the head of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty housing units, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested because residents of one of the apartments may need to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM said.
Many Opposition to Medical Aid to Die at Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the Quebec Medical Assistance in Dying Bill.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would want to end their lives, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus was on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Réseau des cartes palliatives du Québec also rejected the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
“What is the meaning of life,” she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Alliance’s vice president, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill disorients people about the calling for palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, the Liberal MP for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the notion of end-of-life will need to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan Press Outraged by Controversial Media Law
“It’s a scary country and it’s legitimate to ask yourself the question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?” the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extension of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya’s place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians,” he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to “take control of the media,” The Standard said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “had been hit hard” and called the bill “draconian.”
The passing of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate mall last September.
Kenyan media sparked anger by authorities by broadcasting footage of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly toppled the luxury mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to interrogate them, although the summons was withdrawn following a lifting of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the added risk of being "removed" or unable to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid the fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere.”
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
“Levered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering.”
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of the anger of the population in the past.
In May, they took a stand against wage cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and re-established their miraculous wages of about 532,000 shillings per tax-exempt month – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) de Laval caused a stir to the management of the H<0xC3><0xB4>pital de la Cité-de-la-Santé in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the department of pharmacy has found itself heavily in personnel deficit.
It lacked nearly 30% of the necessary staffing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to hire self-employment, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
We did not use troubleshooting, Beaudet explained.
We've streamlined or reduced some of our activities inside the facility to stop things from happening again.
Of course, we worked hard to get our young people [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
There is a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this arduous period, the year 2013-2014 is clearly easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are returning to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain have been fruitful, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now it's much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill our departures from last year.
Always growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always drive to three maternity leave when it goes well, she added.
Last year we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists that are available to make replacements, so it was harder.
The 22-year-old top model doesn’t start his film career through the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (the 1st and 8th January 2014), the erotic memories of a 40-year-old addicted to sex since her teenage years.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to her eldest is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to lay naked on glazed paper will show up in much more sulfurous situations on the big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the canvas: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he resorted to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt is the star; below the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing his actresses into their last entrenchments, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, as a result of throat tingling felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility proceeded to evacuate the room and warned the firefighters for a suspicious smell.
Approximately 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on tear gas jet background?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still, the director of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was aired and everything was in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman attempted to bring two kilograms of cocaine hidden in pumpkins into the country on Thursday morning at Montreal Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine was distributed in three previously emptied pumpkins.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said CBSA spokeswoman Jacqueline Roby.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montréal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1,653 narcotics seizures.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range SA-8 ground-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place under circumstances roughly identical to the one that took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont ground-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's on Friday lowered Ukraine's credit rating, questioning the ability of the recessionist former Soviet Republic to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", falling into the category of speculative investments.
It comes with a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again within a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government’s strategy will guarantee enough foreign currency to meet its high foreign financing needs,” the agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine’s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and forecasts that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities are massively resorting to to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency judges more and more likely a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying a $882 million bill.
The announcement is bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbor, furious over Kiev’s willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public in the aftermath of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter contraction between July and September.
Its still relatively modest debt has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, with a budget deficit, has been demanding for months the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 granted it a loan of $15.3 billion and has so far released only 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by raising gas prices for the population.
Following a new, unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF said this week that “large external financing needs” were “vulnerable,” while noting “signs of economic improvement.”
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect an improvement in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the expert told AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international economy.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditional on the release of opponent Yulia Timoshenko.
“Signing the deal would be positive for long-term trade but there could be short- and medium-term negative consequences related to Russia’s reaction,” said S&P, who fears Moscow’s “trade restrictions.”
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that in the event of the creation of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
Green light from the United States to the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they had received no objection from U.S. authorities to their merger, approaching the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the previously announced review period for the merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, as envisaged by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups said in a statement.
They said they also received the necessary permits in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the examination period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the transaction.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorizations and approval from the shareholders of both groups," they add.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units would chase M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be on the verge of being beaten after being driven from localities in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that it had controlled since the beginning of the insurgency 20 months ago.
"We will pursue the M23 and pin it wherever it is hiding because it is criminals," FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the villages under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, told RFI that the military setbacks would not change his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last insurgent-held town to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion was born in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu Province, taking advantage of the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma has led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's largest in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid response brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was redesigned and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of advancement of government troops is unprecedented today.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” Congolese business expert Jason Stearns predicts on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic – it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has managed to defeat a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, who fiercely denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, made up of former mutine Congolese soldiers.
British Foreign Minister William Hague has invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali spoke of the possibility of military reprisals following shells dropped on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the people of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of FARDC soldiers.
“We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable to be released by the military,” said a resident of the bordering town of Uganda.
“We have lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatized,” the man added.
Tests conducted by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have proved negative, the health ministry said.
The two cases identified in May 2013 remain therefore the only two confirmed cases in France to date.
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being affected after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, reported on Friday that its quarterly profit had fallen due to lower refining margins, while its oil and gas production had risen while still lagging behind the group's targets.
Its third-quarter net income decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters were expecting an average profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year, with a 25% growth in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion over two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream operations (including refining and chemical production) decreased by 45 per cent to $380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a falling net profit on Thursday, despite the rise in its gas and oil production.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) has since the beginning of the school year required a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested," explains Ms Lefèvre.
In her view, the CSRS was invited to mediation and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
"It is always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions," says Ms Lefèvre.
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) did not comment.
The organization has only indicated that mediation is part of the complaint process.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency rooms of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu
Faced with the slingshot led for several months by a part of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "delay the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies that can not intervene on November 4".
A request officially made "to run no risk on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but that also aimed not to hinder the campaign of the PS a few months from the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective by that date.
Even if, in the APHP, it is preferable to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of November 4, firefighters who insured about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency rooms at the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu will have all been ordered to take thirty serious cases a day to the emergency rooms of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of internships.
At the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, interns specializing in emergencies will leave place on Monday to five general medicine interns.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency reception service of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4, "says Loïc Capron, president of the Medical Establishment Commission (CME) of the APHP, who supports the project of the management.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency," he said, arguing for the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer the serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on site, he also said.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
“Things are happening gradually,” replies Nicolas Péju, ARS spokesman for whom, on 4 November, “there will be no change in terms of service rendered.”
“The minister lied to us or we lied to her,” says Gérald Kierzek, an emergency doctor.
Dismissed from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the slung against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "alarm thrower" in the face of a "cynical" decision made by "the medico-administrative technostructure".
"They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he said.
"If the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
They are regularly engrossed.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting in the emergency departments of Lariboisière.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" to several sites do not risk represent an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APHP are defending the "new hospital model" already launched since October 7 and which is expected to continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also come to participate in the establishment of a "permanence of outpatient care".
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnose," asks Gerald Kierzek, who says "the not serious emergency concept" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will be the same as for Level 3 maternity wards.
People aren’t crazy, they’re going to go where there’s the best care offering.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change armrests, warns Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency physician and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP councillor of Paris and elected of the 4th arrondissement, clearly announced that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of the emergencies at the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled on Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, she would clearly disagree, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of deferral to other hospitals.
Obama Ends Hearing on IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end the wiretapping of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said Thursday.
The decision is part of the White House’s attempt to take back the hand in the NSA’s wiretap case after revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the IMF and World Bank have been overseen by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal.
Asked about the matter, a U.S. administration official responded: “The U.S. is not conducting electronic surveillance targeting the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington.”
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official said Barack Obama had ordered the practices to stop over the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at roughly the same time as the one ending the wiretapping at UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of this information.
UN welcomes new poverty targets
The United Nations will now begin working on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in highlighting the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “exceed national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on progress under the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace to come back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment firm.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a t-shirt marked “we want security” in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo almost every day, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are significant for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo mutually reject responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government holds Renamo accountable for triggering the conflict, and accuses her of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the deal was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to alleviate tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
“They are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing,” said Joseph Hanlon, a speaker at the Open University and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasury from the government.
The share of votes collected by the Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to get more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who is expected to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what the Renamo’s capacity is, but it has carried out disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where is Beira, the port from which mining companies, notably Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if the Renamo would reiterate this threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened government frustration, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that it’s up to the president to find solutions to problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“Nobody cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “lifestyle models,” the author says.
The Legend of Thor might show that "brutal force does not make the weight in the face of subtle cunning," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "far too violent, far too scandalous, and in some cases far too obscene to be taught in school," Crossley-Holland advocated a "meticulous selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” causes children to “completely drop out,” with messages being “sublimated” into pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an adult writer writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything needs to be simplified or end up well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
One Hamas fighter was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza have learned.
According to the sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shot with shells from an Israeli armored vehicle.
NSA spying: U.S. 'goes too far' admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in terms of espionage, admitted Secretary of State John Kerry, in Washington’s first admission in full controversy with Europe over the massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a U.S. government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA’s interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I concede it to you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that it doesn't happen in the future," Kerry said at a conference in London he was attending from Washington on October 31.
In his relay, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of U.S. diplomacy has long justified the practices of intelligence and information gathering through the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since foiled many plans for attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these plans in advance," he said.
John Kerry told Europeans, “I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived.”
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far inappropriately," the secretary of state admitted, who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said on Thursday evening that President Obama was “determined to try to clarify and to review these practices so that no one feels mistaken.”
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, says the program dubbed "MUSCULAR" and conducted with the NSA's British counterpart, the GCHQ, allows the two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibers used by internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected during January alone - ranging from metadata on emails, to text items, or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any link to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with anger from European states and as leaks in the U.S. press claimed that the U.S. president was not aware of such listening, Barack Obama refused to speak out on the matter, citing national security.
On the other hand, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied him that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to the European intelligence services that allegedly seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve “military operations” in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and it would not target Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spying network that has also stirred China's anger.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without its master asset, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the Ligue 1 club announced in a statement.
The PSG, leader of the championship against Monaco in the difference of goals, released the list of players selected for this game of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The statement simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned to the selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the deceased crematized
The crematorium of Père Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the mayor of Paris, must attend the meeting and will then explain her funeral proposals at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% choosing cremation.
In his book Death in Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes, for the survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "deletion of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is readily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
“Because cremation is a new fact,” replies Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Taming Death.
It has only been tolerated by the Catholic Church since 1963, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To tame the cremation, it is for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Michaud-Nérard, general director of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as the one to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want a ceremony to be held.
66% of atheists or non-believers want it too.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For ten years, they have been striving to avoid the violence of waiting for families, doing nothing, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the release of the ashes," notes Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now offer ceremonial masters, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: welcome the assembly, appoint the deceased, connect him to others, evoke him, give meaning to his death, organize the farewell.
This has been the case at the crematorium of Père Lachaise since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Père Lachaise, since 2010, the Day of La Toussaint, organizes several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of people who have been crematized in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, relocation because of rats turns to controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their ground floor apartment of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
Given the urgency of the situation, the Director of the Terres du Sud Habitat Office, proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
Rats have always been in towns.
The deratification company performs two passes a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our own expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have made 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the rats are not crowded in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, detratification products are four times less effective than in the past, though for two rats, we are not going to kill a child.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," defends the father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon out of money and we are expecting a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange Down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange fell on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The price has suffered from the fall in the dollar against the yen, damaging export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix dropped 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony fell by more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house prey to flames in Old Quebec
A fire that set off Friday at noon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Quebec Seminary.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was under control one hour after the firefighters arrived, and many intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," said France Loiselle, a Quebec fire department spokesman.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of master of ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly in front of the audience, on the tone of conversation.
Fay’s innovation has continued over the years, until being picked up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows performed in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival with the aim of continuing to work with them.
This year’s event will feature the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes”, a comedy and music evening for veterans at Madison Square Garden, which will feature, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year’s festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, for example, presenting shows on small TV channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll appeared on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel (“The League” on FXX’s fantasy football theme joyfully lascivious) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated on Saturday Night Live and was part of the cast of the Parks and Recreation series, but she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, along with other singularly voiced young actors (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic racial justice advocate W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors for the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting takes place at the City Hall in central Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, he sometimes walked down an alley between two buildings and thought, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here.
Oil Price Continues to Decline and Closes to $96 Per Barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the size of inventories offset a report showing China’s electricity-hungry manufacturing sector is growing stronger.
The price of U.S. reference crude for delivery in December dropped by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel late in the morning in Europe during e-exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop in October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest a rise in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, following a decline not seen in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Abortion rights challenged in Texas
A federal appeals court in Texas re-established certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a law passed in July in that state that largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The Court of Appeal’s ruling means that doctors who will be practicing IVGs will have to have a “admission privilege” with local hospitals.
Admission privilege is the right of a physician, under his or her status as a nursing member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre for the purpose of providing a diagnosis or treatment.
The defenders of the IVG argue that the content of the law could result in an immediate closure of one-third of the state's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge ruled on the eve of the law's entry into force that the provisions dealing with admission privilege were unconstitutional.
But Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who is advocating for governorship, has asked the appeals court to overturn the trial judgment that blocked enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star made a return to strength, audience-side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV set, or 5.6% of the audience share.
But was the show at the meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates appeared at the auditions of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villainous Sinclair, the perched André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of regaining their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored in this first premium.
As every year, the earliest audition shows braze a wide selection of aspiring singers, for the better and sometimes for the worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few found their account.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind the TV screens, the vocations of a successful singer are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD’s control and search policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's inspection and search program and removed it from the file.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) indicated that Justice Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the constitution following the implementation of its program to monitor and question citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard Tuesday the arguments regarding the suspension request.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge must be removed from the case because she violated the judges’ code of conduct by jeopardizing the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly reacted to court criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men of Hispanic origin as part of their control and search program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy, training and supervision reform, and ordered a pilot program to test body-borne cameras in areas with the largest number of controls.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal by the city is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of control and excavation has been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 checks that mainly concerned black and Hispanic men.
A lawsuit was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a class action.
Advocates of changes to the NYPD’s control and search program say they will end unfair practices, provide more effective and trusted police forces, and change the way police departments use the policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without lowering crime, would be a waste of money, and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police workforces were sharply reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that she was not ending control and search practices, which are constitutional, but that she was reforming the way the NYPD was implementing its controls.
Renters must go to vote, as each of them pay an average of $100 per month on the price of housing that goes in taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each home.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us they would tackle the outrageous debt.
We can't afford $100,000 in fireworks anymore, $4 to $5 million in land in case...
Go vote, that’s the best way to express yourself and say that’s enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entered the 500 m2 of Elysee kitchens as clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the ladders until becoming chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their vacation spots, and fed countless of the world’s great in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60.
The man with an open face, skull and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 in the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a patisserie CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I've gone from one castle to another!" says Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has officially served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
“It is always the head of state or his wife or wife who chooses the menus,” he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she was coming directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Do not displease heads of state who showed a relative indifference to terrestrial foods, "they are all greedy," denounces kindly Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, who restored cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like."
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that was weighing on his shoulders, especially at state dinners at the Elysée: you have to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand if there were mistakes.
The now former chef of the Elysée, who had a drink Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart.
He said praise.
"Its human side has come out," he said.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec on Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 rue Hébert, was the subject of three alarms to the fire department.
The fire broke out at the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, a spokesperson for the Fire Protection Service of Quebec City, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where the buildings are built in close proximity.
The burned house contained four dwellings, but no tenants were on the site at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Release of the Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese leaves out some footage from his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will decouple you into his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells the true story of a "Long Island stockbroker who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast corruption case on Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort started a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains the parties, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the key words of this crazy story.
Scorsese-DiCaprio seem to have found the magic that united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese has been delayed due to its too long assembly.
It seems that the film lasts 2h45 in the end.
In the hall on December 25, he will be able to participate in the Oscars race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson reportedly used “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm a fake tip on a liaison involving then-incumbent Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her “pretty special counsel.”
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and "permanently crash on her doorstep," but Coulson also called her and left her voicemails.
“The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man who stands in front of people’s homes hoping to surprise them, he’s the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they say about it,” Edis said.
He said NotW used three ways to investigate the issues: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Is he aware of the phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say “Of course we do.”
Rumors of an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said she was told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, on which were recorded voice messages pirated on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer that involved Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the period the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Edis added.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's slightest deeds and actions.
In a voicemail he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny that they had conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to conducting phone hacking.
Barack Obama welcomes Iraqi Prime Minister in the midst of violence
The president was scheduled to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking help from the United States to combat the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures released by Iraqi authorities on Friday.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 were injured.
The United Nations reports an even higher record with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
The violence is increasingly deadly despite increased security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shia-dominated Nouri Al Maliki government.
The total death toll in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
Approximately two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence has led to fears of a new fire as neighboring Syria is plagued by a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot down in the streets or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the ruling Sunni minority under Saddam Hussein, who complained of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has fostered this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, in the wake of the deaths of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars bombed north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a “global war” against al-Qaeda.
The violence is at the center of interviews in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the U.S. president, elected on a promise to end military engagement in the country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and congressional elected officials.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a “third world war” against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing Accuses Uighur Group of Tiananmen Attack
China's head of homeland security accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang on Friday of being behind the car bombing that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, crashed into the crowd in China’s famous capital square, a symbol of the deadly crackdown carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement in eastern Turkestan of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there, driven by demands for independence.
“The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated,” Meng told Hung-Kong TV.
"The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of eastern Turkestan," he added, his remarks being taken up by the new China agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement of eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican Surveys Contraception, Divorce and Homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a large survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The poll was sent in mid-October to each national bishops’ conference, with instructions to get as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper from the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide the appropriate way to probe the parishioners.
In the UK, bishops posted the poll on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: the army attacks the last fief of the rebels
The irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred fighters, were enclosed at nearly 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two villages located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," a resident of Jomba told AFP, reached by phone at around 12:30 p.m., and according to which a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it appears that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels back a little."
According to the witness, wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "overnighted" in Jomba before climbing up to the front for a "razing operation".
Behind him we heard very clearly the crackling of light weapons.
From Bunagana, the political fiefdom and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase", with the FARDC having "encircled the remaining M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, the Monusco has not participated directly in the fighting, but it provides government troops with decisive intelligence, observation and planning support.
In the late afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well-stocked with ammunition, ascended towards the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border crossing with Uganda, military aided by civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to take over another machine pounding the M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday evening called once again on the rebels to “demobilize voluntarily” otherwise they would be disarmed “by force”, but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without result for now.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, there is only Ugandan mediation left to organize the signing," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born from a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated areas in the DRC, and its subsoil is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where some 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the return movement to the DRC that had begun in the morning reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including one infant on her back, told AFP.
It feels like the gunfire is getting closer to the people.
Early in the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, this stage beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the productions sung and danced take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical asserts itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart's rock opera, most of the attempts stuck in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables were the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as hit tubes.
The first takes up, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the worldwide creation of "Un Américain <0xC3><0xA0> Paris".
In Mogador, “Beauty and the Beast” may well be one of the season’s successes.
On the other stages, musical shows such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" come to the tune of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comedies musicales" and lecturer at the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre du Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard conquered.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First, there are the "musical spectacles" that evolve according to the producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year leap back on the pretext that we can serve just about anything when we have Matt Pokora at the head of the poster.
Then we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet that revive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest composer alive.
Stage Entertainment popularized Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are attempting a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects like "Rent", "The Spider Woman's Kiss" or "The Spring Awakening" are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough performers like Broadway capable of singing, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musicals, it’s very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
The jobs are numerous among regional theaters, tours, Broadway, the off-Broadway...
The pool of talent is as large as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often the boulevard theatre for adults rather than young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of an enthusiasm of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are cleverly maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial zenith.
Mayonnaise is grown in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning at around 5.30 a.m. in the Brussels inner ring at Hoeilaart, heading for Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the site of the accident, as long as the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause any traffic jams because the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this outlet/inlet of the ring.
Child seriously injured at Disneyland Paris attraction
A five-year-old was seriously injured in an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His prognosis is no longer committed, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: The army is preparing a new assault
Children are playing on a charred armored vehicle that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday for a new assault on the last strongholds of M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by herself.
There will be only the hill of Runyonyi left.
"Chanzu is not very strategic," North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fiefdom and last stronghold of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was picked up on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23 have been enclosed at nearly 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day said the situation was "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the fighting the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot and three others were injured, including one who was severely evacuated by FARDC, the witness said.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have given no record of loss of life.
NSA Revelations Increase Business Paranoia About State Oversight
On a beautiful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital, at low altitude.
Upon order of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media reported that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence services, again insisted in September that the U.S. is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a whistleblower, began to unveil his inexhaustible treasure trove of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on their word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage providers, including Google and Yahoo, have sparked more than ever corporate paranoia about state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that overflowed the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data should be used in their mutual interest.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German IT SMEs.
German companies believe the US poses as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey released in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in all documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, there is no evidence to date that the United States has passed on business secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical of this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them.
“This is not the right way to do it,” said Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Anything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations has been a shock to some companies who thought China was the biggest surveillance risk up until then.
A big change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-U.S. members gave up their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations about the U.S. data mining program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-CEO of SAP, said: “Our customers today ask us a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been one.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Managing Director of the chemicals company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate executives are generally unwilling to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in case that would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long been hammering the message that it is at least reckless to retrieve a free USB stick at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of automaker Audi, says the collection of mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany’s BfV advises its executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad due to the risk of breaching the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out by the United States in February cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, as guilty to the second degree of conducting acts of hacking economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French domestic intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia teenager who died in unusual circumstances think their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a wrestling mat rolled up in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found stuck on Jan. 11 in a carpet resting behind the gymnasium stands of his high school.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family disputed those findings.
“They are absolutely certain their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these findings were delivered with the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a handbag and he was returned to them in a mortuary bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I think there is a sufficient basis” for opening an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of “positional asphyxiation.”
However, a second autopsy has identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence that justifies a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office representative was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgian judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to hand over all video surveillance records that investigators had examined.
The teen’s parents said they hoped the video footage would contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on children's allergies to schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines released by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff on food allergies in children, and how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction.
He also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the EpiPen brand auto-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “I feel like something bites my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue,” or “I have tingling on my tongue.”
The NSA case highlights the complete lack of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand offends itself in public by summoning the US ambassador on October 21, and on the other hand prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on board his Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response on the part of the French government.
When Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the scale of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Isn’t it surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence on the one hand and on the other a condemnation of the listening to the Quai d’Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't it be like a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks unveils the analysis by US diplomacy of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of US power, it is an important illumination.
When we describe the American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to indignate us about this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Did France benefit from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation?
The implementation for roughly ten years of very powerful interception technology tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in tribal areas in Miranshah has been reported to the French through NSA means.
France can be led, for example, to pass on entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to U.S. services, and, in return - it has already been quickly said - the Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the substantive issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to provide themselves with interception tools, as the question of the total lack of prior debate, especially in parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope that should be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of violations of freedoms.
What does the United States really risk? a deterioration of its image?
No matter how much we denounce them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk taken by the Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest summit of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. providers subject to U.S. laws, and thus to the NSA’s control.
Lastly, the vast movement of revelations launched by media around the world, which helps spark a debate about intelligence surveillance practices that had hitherto been virtually non-existent, could push lawmakers, including the US, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose “indeterminate sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly attributed to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child’s sex, allowing them to include an “indeterminate” or “unspecified” sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and struck.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersex being part of the group of sixties of diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sex identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering surgery, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist in sexual identification issues, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It’s like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexuals, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sexual traits (such as muscle mass, hairiness, chest and stature), primary sexual traits (such as reproductive and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the employment discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudiced crimes.
Young boys of non-compliant gender now have special camps for them.
Australia and Nepal already authorize adults to include male, female or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as “neutral” after winning her appeal trial that allows her to keep an unspecified sex for life.
German passports will feature a third designation alongside M or F-X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators in this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school books.
Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overturned."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be attributed to babies at birth.
“The role of a parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s sex,” she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely ten years ago, the medical community saw the genus as a slate, which can be erased and redrawn on.
But now, many are questioning the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel their sexual reassignment as they grow up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender malleable.
He enshrined the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals - the way parents raise a child - interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as either male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a messy circumcision to have him completely castrated, also removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “always repeat this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations say “[they] are not satisfied with the outcome.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors couldn’t really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the outer organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn’t happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he found out horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual developmental disorder (SDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sex organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, undergoing testosterone treatment and got his breasts removed.
Surgery made her sterile.
Today, he advocates for the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, CEO of California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites labeling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an ‘indeterminate’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we did not see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be recognized as third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should lead at that age.
As they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a sexual developmental disorder and who is helping thousands of people in a support group, said German law will “hold” parents and children accountable.
Dr. Baratz’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie has developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and infant psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
“The law gives parents a certain latitude so that they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This gives them time to take certain tests and understand them, and a delay before enrolling "male" or "female".
So everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“It puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they’re afraid they won’t do the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and that’s a great thing.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes his government will last until 2015 despite strong left-right tensions within the ruling coalition ahead of the Senate vote to dismiss Silvio Berlusconi from his term.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the center-left leader says he has "strong intention" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former Council president convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his impeachment.
But part of his camp, grouped around the national secretary of the People of Liberty (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 last its refusal to yield to Berlusconi's injunctions, who already wanted to overthrow the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an officer from the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the gunfire exchange.
Firefighters called at the scene said they responded to a call reporting "multiple wounded".
"Police forces are on the ground," the airport said on its Twitter account, as images on television showed people evacuated in ambulances.
“There has been a shooting,” a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second person transported in a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. locally (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also specified.
The Los Angeles Times reports that items 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights arriving and departing from the airport were suspended.
Israeli Army Kills Hamas Member in Gaza Sces
Israeli tank fires killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas militant on Thursday and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, health services sources said.
A Hamas source explained that fighting broke out in the region as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli military has merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called a "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, which was dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign deemed dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have considered, in the utmost secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most striking event featured in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s highly anticipated 2012 campaign book, “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be released and told Thursday night that the president’s close collaborators had conducted “deep group work and surveys in late 2011” to see if Biden’s eviction could help Obama in his re-election as his hopes diminished.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice President by former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the ballot.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept within the Chicago Field HQ and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president — including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina, and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was under consideration.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “did not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember, at that time, the president wasn't in shape, and so we were like, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the review “a concerted one,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to find out if the change would be beneficial during the election.
"Campaigns don't spend a lot of money on surveys and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the possible rework.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of the eventual change, the former secretary general admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not definitively answer the question of whether political polls had arrived at Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama did not know that Biden’s eviction from the presidential list was being examined.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice cream.
Charlie Francis harnessed the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He came up with the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the warmth of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, said: "It's something incredible but we're still in the early stages in terms of production, and 2g of this thing costs about <0xC2><0xA3>200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice begins to shine.
We tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary bright effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice I have created because the luminescence of jellyfish is worth four times more than gold.
Each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation looks even more ambitious.
He added, “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning as he was looking at the trees and performing the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his musician’s hands splitting the air,” writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also said she had promised her husband the week before his death to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are city dwellers, it is our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of life he had," she said.
Lou Reed had undergone a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pinky.
In the last two years, I haven’t distributed a single candy and I certainly won’t do it this year.
But the stats show that I'm the cocky sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is the trends.
The costumes are expected to be $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers, and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the Walking Dead TV series, and I bet that Daft Punk spacemen will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there is no harm in staying traditional.
We dressed up our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
It's a lot of curious dogs dressed up as hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, you don't get frowned on.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go hunting for candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we are going to buy and, let's not tell each other stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candies are the only thing you don’t want to eat, and yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I have not yet solved.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which is actually a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted homes in the U.S., which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome pictures of you peeing on Facebook that your friends put on and you can’t remove and on which a guy you like leaves a “beautiful head”-style comment.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and sculpting a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve done since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the “pumpkin baby trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these pumpkins and didn’t have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lanterns that slowly wax on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922kg pumpkin.
In-house, Royal Bank of Scotland will create a bad bank with <0xC2><0xA3>38 billion (€45 billion) of the most risky assets to relax its relationship with London and accelerate its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce the share of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have fully cleared it within three years.
RBS also said it would enter an additional <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>4.5 billion depreciation provision on the quarter, a write-up linked to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also said that the internal restructuring would free up <0xC2><0xA3>10 to <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion in capital, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would allow a trace of the past, with the government in particular being accused of meddling in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a large bank for customers and for the UK,” said new CEO Ross McEwan.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior features bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved braking, access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “Rally fans joining Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try out different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of raid rallies.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is really going to be exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a road accident without severity
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry.
Firefighters descended as a reminder along the cliff to retrieve the bitch and save her from a certain death
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called in to safely retrieve him as he was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost bitch and made a call on social media sites after she disappeared into the career following a non-serious accident.
At around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with sharp eyesight walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Barracks rushed to the scene and descended in recall to save Ruby using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She didn’t move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate some biscuits afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very fortunate to get away with it unharmed.”
She could have been badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified to watch the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was surprising to have him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each one of them has been absolutely awesome.
Mr. Alderson, of Keighley, added: "We were afraid she would fall, but she didn't move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never flirted with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a choirist on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He dragged me when I was 18.”
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very nice.”
In a statement Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said he “categorically denied making advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added, "Maybe she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, landed at the top of the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question a Turkmen Islamic movement
"Behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," the Chinese security chief told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CCP), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization after Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family from the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with gasoline cans into Beijing’s Forbidden City entrance in a suicide attack that killed two people and wounded 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and mother were killed in the car fire.
The Etim, which declares to be fighting for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, formerly the name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the UN in 2002 among organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
The movement is often referred to by the Chinese authorities as being responsible for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The breakup of Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are being warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free movement zone in order to be able to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and was to be expected).
Neither did anyone say that the EU member states spend a lot of their time circumventing their formal rules when they are arranged.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scots.
This is a story that is not one.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I first heard the bummer that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
Yet one interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland actually follow Europe’s instructions?
Why exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties opposing the EU or advocating the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and removed the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the scourge on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has imposed on its members exchange rates favorable to German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper discomfort related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a downside in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is raging, especially in France, one of the EU’s major leaders.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy in trouble.
As a result, Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, returning the Socialists to power in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split from the right will automatically favor the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with her new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single, anti-European currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like the "Europe of Nations (sovereign)" privileged free by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will be gentle on the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending around Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European agreement provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and it should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a dramatic majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor, Alistair Darling, and the Conservative/Liberal Democratic coalition who followed.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Aging Early
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter’s breasts and pubic hair start to grow at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, pedo-endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among young American women and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid shift towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area, and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of first menstruation over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, compared to 12 years three-quarters in 1970.
"Once the breast has started to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first menstrual periods appear," Kaplowitz, also the author of Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem, said in a statement.
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution may justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormone treatment are based on the child's age, rate of development, rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs but acknowledges that "controlling puberty can alleviate certain behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young girls to have their periods.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first menstrual period at the age of 10.
Even though there were signs and we had talked about the rules, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She returned from school frightened and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment, or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study in girls aged 6 to 9 years that links the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate and genes.
Another problem: Although boys have younger hair on the face and in the pubic area, the trend towards real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be cautious about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paedo-endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls with early puberty should be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Tribute to the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinematheque, had won the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Unable to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have thrown their destiny on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be an accomplished musician and folk singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich outfits in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less shiny clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the oath sworn at the machine gun when she speaks.
Inside Llewyn Davis tells about a week of the tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the whole earth.
He backwards accepts foot-lifted replacements in the studios.
Without housing, he is touring the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who isn't there at the right time, who isn't a careerist but an integer, with self-destructive behavior," Ethan Coen, who was crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and awards in Cannes, told reporters.
While Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich Village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as writes journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes documentary looks, from the unsold 33T-invaded dusty music label inhabited by an old, unpaid secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and to the cafés where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by incorporating a funny character that constantly passes through the film: a gorgeous red cat with a splashy eye, Llewyn Davis’ fortune companion.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled growing up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country.
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he said.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is needed to “be considered good,” “chance can also launch someone’s career,” and “increasingly today.”
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get stuck with anything that can keep us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", has died.
He never knew the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times described him as “the espionage novelist who knew too much.”
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theater of the 198th and 199th installments of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically diminished by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was traveling during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published annually, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, ensured he ignored the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first in the series, almost half a century ago.
"No doubt between 120 and 150 million all countries combined," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his lap, in the living room of his huge apartment in an apartment building on Foch Avenue, close to the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages into which SAS's adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"In addition to pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivories reported from the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a packet of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a poor Austrian aristocrat and CIA contract agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, goes after all the villains of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s onwards.
With each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
“I never pretended to be a literary author,” explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked “like the great pre-war reporters, Albert London, who went on site and came back with real and lengthy investigations.”
The father of SAS said "make some kind of geopolitical soap opera."
“I am constantly following my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving,” Gerard de Villiers added.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those from AFP, diplomats, people from the services that I have known to some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitory: for example, a month before the attack on a command center of the Syrian regime that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Road to Damascus".
In "The Madness of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat in "The Conspiracy of Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he reported the 4X4 columns of jihadists who were based on the Malian capital.
I am not a fortune teller, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realized.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 daisy IBM typewriter "whose all the pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords are hung on the walls of his desk.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always well received in Africa, where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers once said, “Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not of age.”
He will not die and he will not retire.
No more than me.
Aircraft manufacturers quarrel over seat width as big commands are at stake
The dispute rages between major aeronautical manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at Dubai's air show this month.
The dispute concerns the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers – which are not always the most courted by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economy classes, but its major American rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as aircraft manufacturers sought to sell even larger versions of their twin-engined long-haul aircraft, eventually hoping for a record ordering at the November 17-21 event.
The way the seats will be placed at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is critical to the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its refurbished 777X will be able to accommodate 406 people in economy class seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Would you accept this?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ chief commercial officer.
As eating habits change, people get bigger, but seats on planes haven’t changed drastically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's Jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average 40-49 year-old American's weight increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American waist of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival clings to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named jet set was narrower.
Airbus has commissioned a study that indicates an additional inch of seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ figures regarding seat width and says it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that the cabin experience is not only dependent on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their business,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s passenger satisfaction manager.
They do not want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a matter that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies an estimated order race for airplanes worth at least $700 billion at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tilt the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first pointed out in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a 20% higher performance per seat in their latest long-haul twin-engine models than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the configured aircraft with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to accommodate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in terms of our products,” said Kevin Keniston, director of Comfort Passenger at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is driven by the 777 threat,” said Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
Aircraft vendors who travel around the world even take with them a meter to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers a configured A350 with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cab customization by offering wider side aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that its call to the aviation industry to put in place a size standard for seats will succeed, but that it could make forgetting the 777X sales wave.
Oracle shareholders angered by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the proposed compensation for founder and CEO Larry Ellison on Thursday, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but it tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just awarded by his boat's victory in the America's Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison received a negative vote on his compensation.
Oracle's chief executive waived a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but received approximately $77 million from stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire postponed fiscal year 2013, Oracle’s net profit increased by 3.5% while the share price jumped by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which rose by 24% at the same time.
New nicotine vaccine could suppress smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
More tests are needed before human trials begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a steady flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track down all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But mice that had not been vaccinated “were appeased,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently that the levels of antibodies remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibodies factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said the findings were interesting but said much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, the security services learned.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But officials from intelligence, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in the strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shooting," a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, traveling to London, informed the British government that talks had been initiated with Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied altering the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeid owned two restaurants and a café, after they expired in August 2005, without any tender.
It is now investigating allegations that Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary General Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pushed for leases to be tendered.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, leases for Circular Quay companies, which brought the Obeids about $2.5 million per year, were renewed without any tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, Tripodi acknowledged, called for a change in government lease policy.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid in the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don’t remember what we talked about, but it wasn’t that.
At least not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes against missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers with a 457 visa may have to pass an “authenticity” test
The government is currently exploring the possibility of implementing a “authenticity test” for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa as it considers extending enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used in unqualified positions or as a hijacked means of bringing family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
"The breaking statements about 'foreigners back in line' and 'jobs for Australians first' are an unpleasant return to a time when unions were demanding a protected labour market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of white people should be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The working paper outlines the 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others being considered.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to determine “whether the job offer is authentic in the event that the applicant is a relationship or a personal partner of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring company”.
Companies may also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, have actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The 9-year-old man’s dismayed son was traveling to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father died Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the British Government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “would bring the UK together.”
Scottish Transportation Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to consider strengthening rail capacity and improving travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of trip times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we face a problem with the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to “unequivocally” support Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall project of a high-speed rail network across Britain.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to consider options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and completing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps.”
The rules for the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will have to continue turning off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to ease regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases as long as they are in “airplane” mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it painful not to be able to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision requiring U.S. carriers to do important work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but noted that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
“The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on airplanes,” she said.
The issue is regulated by regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has previously spoken to CASA about its intention to expand the use of its onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said it would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a revision of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices as we truly believe it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it is currently complying with the current rules.
“Under our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change that immediately,” she said.
The FAA decision applies to American airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that may benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA’s decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand luggage transport programs and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about 30 people according to the testimony collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was rough on the Pia side where a fight involving several people broke out on the Postal side.
At least four minor injuries were to be deplored.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the site to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s pledge lenders take advantage of middle classes forced to tighten their belts
Janani Amirthalinga drops off a bracelet, ring and a pair of gold earrings at a pledge lender at the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore to pay her daughters’ tuition fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, this week became the third lending company to be introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Placing jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's pledge lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pledges have the advantage of not requesting credit checks or salary proof, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to borrowers as families feel the pressure from rising cost of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by too lax a monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to borrowers to fill the gap as their economies slow.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited rising household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or lower [wage scale] are looking to supplement their income as they can,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have prompted people to pledge their personal belongings to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items pledged in the city’s 200 pledged loan shops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pledge the grandmother's gold chain and we'll come back to get it next month."
In Thailand, the largest lending store operator, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The increase is such in the pants sector that ValueMax, operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says its CEO, Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will fund them using 60% of Singapore’s $66 million it raised this week when it was introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have been criticized for their exorbitant interest rates, Ms. Yeah indicates that the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
“Customers mortgage on property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt,” she says.
The pledge is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed financing in the short term.
People who go to pledge lenders aren’t just those who have financial problems either.
Wealthy people in Singapore also go to ValueMax pant loan shops to pledge gold bars or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“It may be wealthy people who need to borrow for short-term business or investment, or small businesses who need cash to make a tough move,” adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A youth pastor in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor was serving, says he is deeply saddened by the news.
In a statement, church officials said Hudgins had resigned.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with people under the age of 18 and must not access the Internet.
He will appear in a provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being driven out of it
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform striped in a cuff with the hake cross was asked to leave an English supermarket as customers complained to the management of the establishment that called the police, the store said Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," a spokeswoman for the Asda supermarket chain said.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "the time it comes, he was already gone without a blast," she added.
I was queuing when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
The people were mouth-sucking.
“You don’t go out on the street like this unless you want to get attention,” 60-year-old Rosina Rusin told Cambridge News.
This incident happened on Thursday, Halloween day, when it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS armband twice a week for three years at Asda," Dutton said, explaining suffering from "mental problems."
$325 million rescue plan for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout for the faltering health system is subject to stringent conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent action” to end a crisis caused by the aging population of the island state, high rates of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The four-year funding was decided after government consultations with Independent Member of Parliament for Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataracts, will help catch up.
Funding is also provided for non-scheduled clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical managers, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat the Tasmanian health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much “unless it is followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmania’s public health system.”
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent request it made to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will make a significant contribution to removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “wealth solution.”
“The reason we’re here is because the state Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that snatches nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts in $300 million, and pretend it's a splendid day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the bailout plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts remarkable artistic direction and careful period reconstruction, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Higher Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubricity or sensationalism, and that is the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, the watchdog says
Syria has destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day ahead of the deadline for the
November 1 by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or " render unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
Completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
As a result of the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement was made as fighting raged on Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Britain reported.
The group of activists, which tracks the evolution of the human balance through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces were killed, of whom 18,678 were pro-government forces fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, 2,202 were estimated to be deserters and some 5,375 were opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She has not updated this figure since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country due to the conflict.
Assad’s troops have been fighting rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday there were losses on both sides, but gave no clarification.
The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission of ridding Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a long-lasting civil war, within tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, stated that its team was “now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all of the critical production declared and the machines intended for mixing and filling.”
She added that "no other inspection activities were planned at the moment."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... that elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I commend the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzumcu, director general of the organization, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger Caused by Sentence Sentenced Against One of Bali’s Bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali attacks reacted with anger to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted men, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in making the explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass killings for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He has also been convicted of many other charges in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks targeting churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have called for life imprisonment, yet they could have asked for the man, dubbed “Demolition Man” for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, to be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged in front of the execution squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he “died” three times while on respiratory assistance.
Hugues said Patek should have experienced the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds more is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali’s bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t surrender,” added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he laughed at the sorrow he might have caused to others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music — but not talk about it on their mobile phones — under the highly anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the crew training manuals and rules for the storage of aircraft to be compliant.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the plane are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them on until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives the green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when the aircraft descends before landing and not turn them on again until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and rolling on the ground, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with these changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will benefit everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “room overseers” when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and text messages, or upload data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was evicted from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered to be at risk.
“Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile antennas if they are used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government authorize wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has intensified in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce as device usage has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also withstand interference better.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally transmit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s leaders loaded a Kindle e-book reader airliner and made it fly to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired mixed feelings among members of the FAA Advisory Committee as to whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that the aircraft can interfere with an aircraft's systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to require passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling for common sense arrangements for travelers equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A bird helicopted from a platform in the North Sea has been released in the wild
A bird, helicoptered after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The helicopter boarded a helicopter heading for Aberdeen last month before it was brought back to life by the Scottish SPCA at its Alloa Rescue Centre.
The center’s director, Colin Seddon, said: “This water ray was probably a wintering migrator who came from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the depleted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help.”
The water was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to bring businesses together and define what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions in the UK.
The findings of the investigation will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than get stuck in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcana.
When asked for their views on specific political issues – from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competencies should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the advantages of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Lastly, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives in favour of a change in the treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This finding, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world is insisting on a “significant change” that restores power in the UK.
The stakes are high – succeeding in changing the treaty and better representing Britain’s interests would see a shift of 16% of the votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will represent a significant shift in the current balance of power in favor of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means focusing again on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he handed out treats to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the festivities caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich Village" neighborhood.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.
We have fun like crazy people, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
That's good kid, that's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan feast celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller Says Bulgaria's Gas Pipeline Inaugurates a New Gas Era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom’s director said.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest large-scale project in Europe,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, the country through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe passes, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director adds.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "for ever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline has been designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti announced Thursday, taking a report from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This area is 47 km2, if you have three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutinies, an episode in the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutiny, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend 95% on the generosity of London.
The island council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836,000 km2, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, who resides in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify the 836,000 km2, provided it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, neighboring Pitcairn.
The FAA is easing restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft – but it will still be banned from making calls on mobile phones.

Life imprisonment for former Chinese deputy governor
A former deputy governor of Jilin province in northeastern China was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of receiving more than 19 million yuan of bribes, Chinese official media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the president of Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and managers obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing’s first intermediary court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flys" - the junior officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest offices in the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, a party-independent body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two YMCA employees in New South Wales have been charged with sexual assault against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a Royal Commission hearing on child sexual abuse.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Director General Phillip Hare was interrogated in two cases: an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a YMCA fitness instructor was convicted of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was inaccurate, noting that “YMCA external controls were conducted and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst assessments on four institutions during a Department of Education and Communities quality audit conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of children's safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures to protect children.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was left alone with the children, kept them private, made them sit on his lap, told them he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found the YMCA Caringbah's child services manager, Jacqui Barnat, who supervised Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said he rejected staff testimony that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their superior.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relationships they had with Lord have blurred their judgment, which means they have not reported his actions.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his view to the YMCA New South Wales council saying that, for the organization, the lesson learned from "the Jonathan Lord incident" should not be about "reporting" by staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by YMCA Director General in charge of Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that the decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an “excess of zeal” and that it had been poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledged that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the position of prime minister, Mr. Blair reportedly replied, according to the London Evening Standard: “Yes, of course, but it may probably happen, so...”
When many equestrian events experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old, to win.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first guns, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee drove through the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparables – who are the same size – were hailed for presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition at Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Standing up against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat hat a bit on the side in a casual way to scroll his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by judges for his unusual natural training qualities for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
Her mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are an excellent duo.”
They stood up for and against everyone, but both of them ran the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he was competing with Toffee and we were excited that he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has participated in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging and applauding it."
He walked the entire length of the track running and even though it seemed very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he’s sure to be participating in the Horse of the Year event soon – and I’m sure he’s going to make a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They are a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they walked on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he looked really good.
A Chinese newspaper that launched an appeal "will be reworked"
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation is going to be reworked, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public company.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete overhaul,” the regulator said.
The "rework" order emanates from the Guangdon administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles about the listed Zoomlion company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express editorial board was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided “to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible for New Express and immediately overhaul the newspaper’s management team.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express about the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing fake stories for money.
“In this case, I harmed Zoomlion and the media industry and their ability to gain public trust,” he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was chasing for money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express posted his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made television confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in a row.
The radioactive steam leak detected at one of the two Charles-de-Gaulle nuclear boilerhouses in mid-October while the boat was at sea was "safe for sailors", but is not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royale has confirmed to us that the ship is unavailable until "mid-November", "the time to take corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a specialist in the naval defense, assures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
For them, among other things, it is a matter of changing a pump on the failed boilerhouse.
“Everything is being done so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013,” DCNS explains, however.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not in any way jeopardize the program of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier is out of an interim maintenance period of six months.
He had sailed from Toulon in mid-October for a training session.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young fighter pilots.
A "small damage", limited to the containment space of the reactor, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, a flood of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, unending administrative costs.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dollars could be spared to allow for taxation that is very respectful of those who pay.
Any money taken by force from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major enterprises, there is no problem with the sumptuous expenses and the maintenance of lame ducks: cultural center deficit, large subsidies to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to private companies or demolish them.
It is also annoying to note the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that never came.
However, I give an honourable mention of the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
It is not for the public to invest in such companies, but for the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the fishing lakes and piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water users) and the great decline of the population, water use has declined considerably across the territory.
Not to mention wasting water, the city will never run out of water and harsh regulations on its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been run for more than 40 years by ties with pretty degrees for the most part and I don’t think a sheep farmer will do worse.
Discovery of a U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the 4-foot-by-3-tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzag-like for nearly six football fields in length, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs went unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who were reportedly working as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels who must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railroads that departed from the kitchen of a Tijuana house and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant for Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said she issued a “remission notice” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sex crime, after exhausting all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he filed against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would authorize his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of remission against a 40-year-old man asking him to appear at a police station, at the date and time of his choice," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears he could be extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after unveiling more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site battling secret information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
Don’t have your passwords typed to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will make it possible to ascertain the identity of a person making transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Privacy organizations confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 alone and in France, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere, anytime,” said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new technologies that will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most commonly used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
"For example, some people who work in concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable," says Philippe Robin, Technical Director of Identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - this data cannot be captured without their knowledge - and a drawback: sometimes the procedure has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
Consequently, research has been carried out for about twenty years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or the iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of sensors and the computational capacity of computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and Holland deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we’re conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
As a unique and unmistakable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Foresight at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who they claim to be).
Until now, identification has been about the issuance of identity documents: biometrics (prints, photographs, irises) must be compared with the information that the State has on all citizens already registered.
This helps to ensure that a person is not trying to impersonate someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or shop.
“We retrieve images from surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities who circulate freely on the Internet,” said Dany Nassif, NEC France’s business development manager for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take a photo of a quidam who queues in a store, track its progress thanks to facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially involved physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend pointing for another," explains Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
Increasingly, however, authentication will also concern transactions, in particular those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the keying of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in store with his credit card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger in a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Ways to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the box thirty seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
“Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people’s identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which crashes if you try to move it,” Philippe Robin of Thales enumerates.
But in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if these discourses really convince users.
Privacy experts, however, continue to be concerned.
“The advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick, the Canadian Privacy Commissioner.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was inflicted a <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 almond
A motorist was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points removed on his license led to a 6-month license withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a victim surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to burst the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally figured the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in Budget 2012, has entered a 7% stamp fee for properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2M and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own properties as part of a corporation rather than as an individual.
The stamp fee already applies to residential properties in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, representing <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: "Following the increased stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the high-value anti-avoidance law, it is very difficult to anticipate that high-value properties are undertaxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestigious real estate – the 5-10% of the property market’s highest prices – in London’s prosperous southwestern sector, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London are growing steadily year-on-year by 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing "domestic market" with the city's southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills' studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog’s tail are related to his mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs moved their tails more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what was happening to other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to disordered tail movements from other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies that featured other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will surely not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We introduced dogs to films that featured other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion – and we were able to smuggle the tail movement and present it as going more left or right.”
When the animals saw an expressionless dog waving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog waving the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail deviating mainly to the left (again from the dog's perspective moving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Instead, he thinks that dogs know from experience the movements they should or shouldn’t worry about.
“If you meet other dogs repeatedly and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side results in a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience.”
The researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, vets and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Science, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs would be easier to go to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what is in the Italian study.”
He said the differences could come from the fact that the dogs that participated in the different studies did not fully regard the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“While many evidence from different mammals indicates that both sides of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will surely not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after its singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield's band was scheduled to perform Friday at The Hydro's downtown concert hall.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement came after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys are also expected to postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1st.”
“Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the one at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis to appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest ranking churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so this amounts to a group of 120 “cardinal electors”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops would be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinals voters will likely have declined.
He said a pope would generally appoint as many cardinals as needed for the number of electoral cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
The consistory next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided on his own.
“From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was "completely possible" for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we’ve never experienced such a situation – it’s totally new.
Valero said the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will appoint.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair seat backrest
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to resolve a problem with manually tilting backrests, according to a statement Friday by the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the inclination mechanism.
As a result, records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for headrests.
"If the vehicle is impacted from the rear, the headrest may not properly protect passengers, increasing the risk of injury," according to a statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
Deployment of GM’s pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first American automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the newsletter to owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, rose by about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock price rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Worker died buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday morning in Montreal.
The drama occurred at around 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
It is likely that work on the foundations has been taking place here for some time.
A joint foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim had just arrived at the site in order to retrieve his tools.
I was passing by in a car and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who stays near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We only saw part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is a man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation maneuvers were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The Cry of Despair of an Elector of Obama
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts thwarted by Republican Party obstructionism
Obstructionism Doesn't Excuse Obamacare Site's Difficulties, Or Drone Attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard School of Medicine.
I am reading an awfully sad book these days.
This is a book that I thought would encourage me during the sluggish second year of medicine and give me hope again.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s the memoirs of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients’ medical records in the evening and I went to bed, this book takes me back to the days when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could breathe your breath.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and newscasters took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before his inauguration in 2008, he had 82% favourable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it’s like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our army from Iraq, to the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the verge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on Americans’ privacy, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the government’s harms.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funding and the exceeding of allowable spending during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we’ve been hearing about for so long.
Yet, while the favorable opinion index plunged below 45% this week, it is even harder to get back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me wish for the many promises that have fled.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered tremendous losses to Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primaries.
At an after-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to focus on our talent,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
Five years later, Mr. President, and I disagree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescue, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from the system.
The mining tycoon, who contested the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued this argument in an attempt to rule out questions about a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to personally benefit from these policies.
"He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave," Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of an overhaul of the voting system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why couldn’t we have a system that you can enter, enter your details in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered possible options for electronic voting and has recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties "very seriously."
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We’re not looking for a reward except the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the New York Wildlife Conservation Society has identified a new species of humping dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, Scientific Mission Officer at the Observatory for Conservation and the Study of Animals and Marine Environments (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humping dolphin surprise you?
This is good news, but I am not particularly surprised.
While species have been described and identified in the past on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of species classification.
Moreover, it is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are challenged due to advances in genetics.
In the same way, two very morphologically close species have been distinguished thanks to genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this sub-family: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this an important discovery as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known to researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present at this location.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extinction of a population of a species more widespread on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered depending on the number of individuals existing on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility it has to recover from neighboring stocks.
With respect to the Sousa chinensis species, from which the population of the newly discovered species is derived, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats where there is a lot of genetic exchange between populations and individuals.
This breeding of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
The marine environment is the least well-known.
It is better to send robots to Mars than to know what lives in the Mariana pit, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on the search for life on other planets than on marine research and it is high time that that changes.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division, according to two sources close to the case, showing once again that the global regulators' investigation into suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators as part of investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where US$5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the expanded investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said RBS had forwarded files of emails and instant messages, sent to and from a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was allegedly suspended from his position as European spot trading manager for foreign exchange at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of spot currency trading at Citi, was laid off this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS said this week it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations made about bankers who agreed to manipulate rates on the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the case said.
Banks are scrutinizing instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news about these surveys has shaken traders in an industry that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth in investment bank trading units in recent years, but which has been challenged this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast, highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at low cost.”
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader working in its London Stock Exchange trading office this week after it caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was under control,” said a representative of Credit Suisse.
Investigation of Mayor Rob Ford has been scrapped, lawyer says
After police confirmed that they had taken a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Clayton Ruby said he had never seen an investigation “as messy.”
Ruby told The Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or downplayed" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and casual driver, Alexander Lisi, 35, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court documents indicate.
Ruby called it "inexplicable" that police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, arguing that Chief of Police Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Mr. Ruby’s remarks an “obvious and desperate attempt” to speak out to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a news conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Stock Exchanges Declined in Mid-Session Except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are declining on Friday at mid-Session, led by some news of disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious as they believe the US Federal Reserve could unlock its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street’s futures suggest an opening of U.S. stocks after two consecutive retreats.
Renault (-4.63%) posted the CAC 40's strongest decline, led by a result warning from its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the poorest performance of EuroFirst300, after also publishing falling earnings this morning and announcing the creation of an internal depreciation structure (“bad bank”) bringing together 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the top of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to a press report that AT&T is considering a possible takeover bid.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation on the ECB's monetary policy developments is well underway, as evidenced by John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB’s single mandate has always been inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week’s meeting.
We are anticipating a strong potential for a fall in the euro.
Against this backdrop, the euro continued to decline against the US currency and hit a two-week low in session at $1.3517.
These same conjectures support the euro area bond market inversely.
Supreme Court approves Obama's health system reform law
Big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared the health system reform law ratified by Obama to be constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to sign health insurance by 2014, otherwise they will have to pay a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government’s taxing powers.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and found that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the Medicaid eligibility threshold should be lowered or all federal funding for the program would be lost, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure to block the law has been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican presidential candidates in the 2012 primaries, including nominated candidate Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and the deceased of all the wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MP-mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Israeli-Palestinian clash on Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday evening during a violent collision on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped operating on Friday after fuel stocks were depleted, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another member of the Hamas armed wing, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell fire during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigades officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred meters into the territory before then withdrawing.
The clash lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zouhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and said Israeli soldiers had been killed in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the Al-Qassam heroes who fell defending the territory during a Zionist occupation raid on Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman said.
The Israeli military said the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug in Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for “terrorist activities.”
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, saying the goal was to abduct Israeli soldiers and exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device targeting the IDF forces and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," Army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel struck an air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles intended for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the Al-Arabiya satellite chain reported Thursday.
A U.S. official confirmed an “Israeli strike” but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he said.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing “exclusive sources” that it has not named, the Saudi capital chain said that “the bombing targeted a cargo of ground-to-air missiles that was intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon,” in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said several explosions were heard Wednesday morning at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
The organization, relying on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents to Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by Satie’s famous piano solos Gymnopédies.
An evening that allows to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre Maisonneuve, advances, profiled, thin as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple line, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the whole piece: a row of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, with only their hands and face uncovered, wait on either side of the playground, rush when the next graphic appears, embody it, come out running.
This black and white play by Henri Michaux is done in solo relays, in a group in unison (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Gloire du morgne", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, posed online at the forefront.
This is the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be breakage when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a portion of Michaux's poem, monocord and monotonous in the crie, and will continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up numbing and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - creating images has always been a strength in Chouinard - like those hairs that get stuffy or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has prevailed, with her tics.
The result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’s inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a broader and more pore-like imagination than dance.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches the magic.
The audience liked it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the intermission, is richer.
The scene is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers relay to play the scores.
Their awkwardness in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in love duets, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
They appear, also familiar to Chouinard, wearing the red nose, in highly polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnage, runaway or gamblers.
The gesture, the laughter and the little cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the bodies in coitus, of the beings that merge.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness transpire, and it is Chouinard's art of contaminating the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei face lawsuits over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, began an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it headdressed at the pole during the auction of patents that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. Court of Assessors in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that enable the display of an advertisement related to search terms on the Internet, the findings of the trial indicated, which is Google’s core business.
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has expanded its offering several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google later acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola’s patent library.
“Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, it has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is claiming greater damages against Google because it claims Google’s patent infringement is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater causing the explosion
The grandmother lighted a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which injured two severely on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, the replacement of the King's prosecutor said Friday night.
The expert sent to the site by the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a gas accumulation.
The prognosis of the two victims is still in place.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was by his side and was burned slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU in Liège, she in a helicopter, he in an ambulance," said the mayor, José Paulet, who was descended at the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the OHCHR.
The Andenne and Namur firefighters and the Arches police intervened.
Crisnée’s civil protection stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to take an oath
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of inauguration, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he swore the oath of inauguration to the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore an oath before the court’s 18 judges in black robes whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
“We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mr. Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mr. Mursi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to applaud the new president and, different from the presidential glory of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic “relief wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has greatly strengthened since his victory and his speech on Friday in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun in the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
“Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mohamed Morsi, dressed in blue and red tie, addressing the judges present in the wooden room where he swore an oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi visited the University of Cairo where he delivered his nomination speech.
He was officially greeted by a military band that played the national anthem as he was on guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song “The people and the army, hand in hand...”, performed by thousands of people gathered in the university’s grand amphitheater.
Founded in 1908 and a former stronghold of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi swore a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year started, and swore to regain the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the former ousted president, dispossessed him of.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mursi’s speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the US has slowed the rise in the automobile market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal administrations weighed on the growth in U.S. car sales in October, figures released Friday by manufacturers show, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
The three major Detroit manufacturers are showing double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market stood at 15.3 million, according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight slowdown is primarily explained by "the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment in the first fortnight of the month."
However, GM reported an increase of nearly 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by the consensus.
All four brands of the group saw their commercial performance improved compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups, saw sales increase by 14% year-on-year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus waited for 194,301.
Fiat-controlled Chrysler announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, up from 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted sales below consensus, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM's share gained 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford yielded 1.1%.
Renault is on the stock market after Nissan warning
Renault on Friday posted the biggest fall in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced it had cut its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20%, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a revision, also announced a change in its management.
Several traders reported that Renault stock was affected by the “warning” this morning.
"That's clearly Nissan's profit warning," said a Parisian broker's trading official.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of the capital of Nissan and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two dead in shooting near neo-Nazi party home
Two people were killed and one was seriously injured Friday night by gunfire fired by two people on a motorcycle passing in front of a local neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in the western suburbs of Athens, a police source said.
At the moment, the police were unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had argued that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Counter-terrorism officers rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place, and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six deputies of Golden Dawn, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in a "criminal organization" as part of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's Appeal Rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his call rejected and will be well suspended for his club's next two Champions League matches, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled from Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a for dealing a blow to Neymar, the Scottish midfielder has seen his suspension extended to three games by UEFA.
In a statement, the club said it was “very disappointed,” saying its appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 households across the province are deprived of electricity shortly after noon Friday, due to strong winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The Greater Montreal area is also experiencing a lot of breakdowns with nearly 7,000 private households in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecasts upwards and expects record results thanks to vacationers from Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to generate an underlying profit for the full year between $325 million and $340 million before tax, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million and $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12-17% growth from the record $290.4 million earnings achieved in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8% profits in the first half and the second half had started strong, especially with regard to non-business trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we operate have been profitable, and several of them are well on track to achieve record year-over-year results before interest and tax deductions,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the biggest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded during the second half of the year, offsetting a slight decline in the domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure travel sector performed well, while business customers spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was lower and was expected to make a year-over-year profit for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Strangers shoot at hotel near Cairo pyramids
Unknown hookers opened fire on Friday at a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without making any casualties, as a result of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, Interior Ministry spokesman General Abdel Latif said.
The attack comes as Egypt has received virtually no tourists since the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloodied protests by his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature classes, students will be required to study at least one Shakespeare play, nineteenth-century novel, romantic poem, and contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also introduce "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will need to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to release its new English and Math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other core subjects next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Regulatory Office of Exams, will unveil a revision of the structure of the CSEGs, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was “broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence,” insisting that the GCSEs would be “more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore do about 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to maths, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the in-depth GCSE of maths – as well as the greater emphasis placed on subjects in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to ensure more hours of instruction.
The program will focus more on "real-world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgement means that a bill passed in July in that state that largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An 80-year-old welcomes children with a rifle to the Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were going from door to door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his shotgun.
The 86-year-old told the police he was scared.
His gun was seized.
Former Gestapo leader buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without his trace being found, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave at the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he told a daily newspaper on the basis of archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would answer one of the great riddles of the After-War.
The German secret services, the BND, assured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was totally wrong.
"As of August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary tomb near the former Reich Air Ministry by a commando," Tuchel said.
He was wearing a "general uniform."
"In the left inner pocket were his states of service with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district council of Mitte district in Berlin stating that he was buried in the neighborhood’s Jewish cemetery.
The president of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by this revelation.
For one of the most brutal Nazi sadists to be buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormous amount of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is roughly trampled on," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who were never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon’s villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him as “CNN Hero of the Year.”
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma from which he was going to carry the aftermath for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken her overseas if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” Mr. Bwelle adds.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health spending is in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed over 700 free surgeries over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they pile up in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to get to villages that need most help.
Luck does not always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy runways.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people on each visit,” said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
Surgeries are usually performed in a school, town hall or home; after the procedure, the patient gets up and goes to the awakening room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a heartbreaking rhythm, but village musicians usually help the team stay motivated.
“They’re hitting drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 free surgeries over the past year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference for those they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It’s going to change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, that finances 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle on his missions, it is a field learning opportunity that they do not have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help sponge the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," Ms. O'Malley said.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and teaching are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt about it,” said Katie O’Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons that drive me to do this.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in amphitheaters and classrooms?
No doubt, but stressing his weakness for the crossing paths, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the Académie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise?
Certainly again, but knowing that such a sacrament cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it has passed.
They gladly recognized in him a great arouser, animator and federator of their work, but noting that he was unwilling to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked tongues could see there a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a vivid glance and weighted with scholarship, but incurably dilettant.
The two works published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who passed by to not write had much and well written.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
Yet, once again, we find the temptation of ubiquity, the intellectual wandering, the jubilation that jumped as if at feet joined from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the brocanteur back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constituent node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: This is a time concern.
Here is a little, we have been collectively invited to give a definition of it.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at the time, the French identity was a timeless essence.
The accidents had only to be deployed, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is chasing is completely different.
He does not present himself as an heir of an eternal frankness, he refuses to the definition.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a rebus-shaped object, tormented by irritating questions.
Of which the latter, which is born of the enterprise itself: why, in a country so permanently established in its borders, so formerly carved and solidly masonized, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are so urgent, suggests Pierre Nora, only to prevent the disturbance born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the division forces here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that divides national history in two.
Since the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wished the death of the first, but could not deny it; on the contrary, anxious to regain its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility as it had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing beats the four steps out of the hexagon, so that Pierre Nora’s American escapade might well be the heart of his book.
For America and France both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousinage only makes it better to emphasize what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no more to worry about.
Here, men cluttered with an Ancient Indigenous Regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here she sowed drama and confided it.
There always honored founding fathers, and here revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to make, and who have otherwise killed each other.
There is an institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, as errors to catch up and trials to resume.
The France that goes, the France that comes
Yet there was a time when the French thought they could sew back the torn robe of their history, and overcome the curse of number two.
At this Third Republic, central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France was obscurely preparing modern France and proposing to them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity only had a time.
Here it is again in debate, pushed by immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of claimant minorities, absorbed in the European area.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that is leaving and the cautious sketch of France that is coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We found out that the chimney was a housekeeper.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The edge walker stood in the center of the center.
And the one who had deposited, here more than half a century, a subject on the idea of nation, but had escaped the initiatory exercise of the thesis, entrusts to us, cum grano salis, that he will eventually have done it.
Certainly in a less steep, more bursting and more subtle form.
But let’s not get it wrong, just as binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis speaks of the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: 'Return is complex enough to manage'
Kidnapped in Beirut on March 8, 1986, with three members of his "Antenna 2" team filming a Hezbollah protest, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostages defense association "Hits of the World", which he has presided over for several years.
Its main objective is to provide hostages with the opportunity to file a complaint and bring hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, a former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hits of the World".
From the evening of your release, you were on the 8 p.m. set of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
Especially in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it is dark - Roger Auque.
He tells me we're free, but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tense too.
This is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They drop us off on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the Summerland Hotel website where the press is present.
French people take us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having a T-shirt dinner at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boards.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We landed in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible move.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three TV channels.
I'm coming back and there's plenty.
The descent from the staircase of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorcyclists take the butt to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do a bit of the police to prevent some from getting up.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're in a good position to find out...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see it clearly.
We're coming out of a hole and suddenly we're under the media lights.
It's a bit complicated, a bit violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
The same night I'm at 8pm, the next day I'm also on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very gently, for a month or two that is a bit like a holiday.
How did the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing go?
I had a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce the days following my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not surrendered to ourselves.
That's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage-takers.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages in Niger?
I'm listening to what's being said.
In particular, the ransom debate.
Some things annoy me, some less.
I try to share things between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the hostages of the world association that allows me to put a distance, and I find it much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I'm fighting, with others, for the recognition of the hostage's legal status.
I think there is a semantic problem.
The taking of hostages must be described as "political" - which is the case most of the time - and allow hostages to have access to justice, to file a complaint and to bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why not say to hostage-takers “you have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we will bring you to justice”?
It seems to me, however, justified, legitimate, struck by common sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the streets to denounce Mursi's trial
Anger rages in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of the deposed president Mohamed Mursi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to call for the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial stresses this activist of the Muslim Brotherhood.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet with him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the documents of the case.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Mursi is a false trial insurgent a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to make Sisi judge, not the other way around.
Mursi must judge Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed outside the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Mursi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, “all military spouses are entitled to a Defense Department ID and the benefits that come with it,” the minister recalled in New York in a speech before the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some states are refusing to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard's facilities" in their territory, he denounced, reproaching those states for violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people will not be able to benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he ordered the head of the National Guard, Gen. Frank Grass, to ensure that the federal law was implemented.
The nine-state slingshot began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on Texas National Guard settlements, due to a conflict between Texas law and federal gay marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage to approximately 5,600 active people, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday 2 November at skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are made on site Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin in the wake, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the awards ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he does not like anything so much as showing it to competitors who surpass him by three heads.
Toronto Mayor Hunts Journalists to Interrogate Drug Case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug use, according to several media outlets.
A video presented to the courts seems to support these suspicions.
Rob Ford has always denied that he had used crack, while admitting he had a propensity for cannabis.
On Thursday, he expelled several journalists from his property who came to interrogate him.
We also think that sometimes images do not need explanation or commentary.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced Thursday that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, manifestly of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies has been confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of people who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28," the ministry of health and agriculture said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The ministries are now calling people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal had been in contact with this kitten between October 8 and 28 to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 am and 6 pm from November 1.
“Being free from rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free,” the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "indigenous" case of rabies identified dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from the Gambia was recorded in 2008.
"Rabies is a deadly disease if not treated in time," the departments recall, and it is communicable for nearly 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama backs down on health system reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that “if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their claimants, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days by accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it,” he said during a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “an effervescence in the news” about terminations, President Obama prompted Americans who received these notices to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better suited health plans for the same price, or even less than expected.
“You’ll win,” he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who contract their own insurance were forced to change plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius said in her testimony before the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace in October had “sadly” failed.
“I’m as frustrated and angry as anyone else,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your confidence.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, while believing her microphone coupé, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, a Republican representative from Missouri, to see if she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long repeatedly asked Ms. Sebelius why the Affordable Care Act's "architect" did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel launches a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky elected Jake Vite Prekop combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
German Formula 1 quadruple world champion Sebastian Vettel has debuted for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose drawing was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from among 1,500 drawings sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of its team.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was due to wear the helmet on Friday and Saturday for testing.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet Sunday, for the race, intended to score his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his suburban party
Let's not be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the suburbs" is not only aimed at suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of suburbs, I speak to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his home town of Aubervilliers, was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes neighbourhoods above all.
My #1 proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, now claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
In 2002, alongside Jean-Pierre Chevenement, he subsequently supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are linked to the left, but if the people on the right are willing to support me, I will listen to them as well.
It is only the extremist parties that I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program - consultable on the Internet - from many themes supposed to speak to suburban residents and especially young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16, the rehabilitation of the function of guardian of buildings...
It remains to be found candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene, "for the municipal elections of 2014, this is likely to be fair, he admits".
It's a problem of time and money.
The Suburban Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope in other cities as well.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven headlines in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I've received since yesterday aren't all coming from suburbs," he said.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage “had gone too far inappropriately.”
John Kerry noted a sharpening of the U.S. defensive attitude toward its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, espionage “had gone too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on “autopilot” when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities emerged.
The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via a video link, Kerry said: “It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government learned about certain things in autopilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War and then, of course, 9/11.”
He later became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had gone beyond bounds, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said, “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to the people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels mistaken.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to get blown up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
In the meantime, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations from the National Security Agency's oversight.
“It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in mutual engagement in the fight against terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate’s European Affairs Subcommittee, said in an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger provoked by the NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some U.S. allies, however the agency's director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it was about metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
Intelligence Director James Clapper justified spying on allies by stating that it was necessary and a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators are expected to be revealed in the coming days.
He said the route had yet to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “affectionate firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state must be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programs they have been running themselves for years.
“We can modify our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to conduct espionage,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Kerry plans to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the resentment generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plunged by Shell's poor performance and the day after an announcement by the Fed that it would maintain its support for the economy as expected.
Australian woman appeals jail sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for wrongly claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the trial and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 of false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance recordings later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the story from scratch.
She was detained in a local police station cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women’s prison.
This is the daughter of former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who called the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“Obviously we had a distressing time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to a heavier sentence of up to two years in prison and incarceration in an adult prison.
However, following the recent Phuket killing of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore its deteriorating image among tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht fans who came differently than with RSCA buses
The French police have decided to lay down strict rules regarding the match of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set on Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman for the police zone Brussels-midday, Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who want to go to this Champions League meeting will have to use the travel system set up by RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Rekem border station to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has informed that measures have been taken to make it possible to carry out arrests or even police officers," Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This motivated a year ago a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to reflect on ways to better integrate students living on horseback across different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
Vision Diversity has been walking in schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighbourhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of strain or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects so that they identify with all of this,” says Vision Diversity President Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne of the Institute of the New World has identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what the Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support to the staff in the transformations that we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he enumerates.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has created a research center that will give tools to teachers who sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, of the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
“Different pedagogical strategies, that’s the real need,” she sums up.
The research will focus on inclusion from all its angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
