Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the proposed cancellation of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs rejected in second reading the proposed amendment to reduce the penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of liberty for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Timosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for concluding an a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the convicted woman’s appeal in December.
Timosenko called the ruling political revenge of the regime and caused a process of suspicion of bias of the court also in the west.
The proposal to cancel paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve.
Victims of Libya
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners remain to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary law of the Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a theft you cut your hand.
Women can forget emancipation, the possible non-respect of the faith is punishable by the death penalty...
It is the Quran that will unite instead of the personality of the dictator the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot represent ourselves and as we surely would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best, and would probably not be beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted aid with gratitude from unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with each attack.
So when it comes to looking for the victors in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militarily occupy Libya.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "cruisers".
Without land occupancy, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of the protection of human rights interested.
As long as we are prevented by these Sharia followers.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the spotlight of investors.
A tornado of the statistics passed on Tuesday over Europe.
Each of the states has published GDP-related information for the 3As.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are looking not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czechia and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is forecast to grow by 0.5%, France's is forecast to grow by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany positioned itself better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the forecast 0.1%), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (the cause of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are heading for a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
The German economy grew 0.5% in the third quarter according to predicted and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy fell 5.2 percent.
The yield on 10-year bonds is 28.45%
Spanish and Italian bond yields are climbing to critical limits.
The problems are beginning to be felt in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% as the situation in the region worsens.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should be the last-instance guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualifying for 200 million
The representation of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football dearly defended with a good share of luck in the second half and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification in the European Championship.
The Montenegrins found themselves under pressure even in the second part because of a precise Czech defense.
The victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first few minutes we played a football warrior.
Both teams had difficulty mounting combinations and the game was mainly focused around the centerline.
The pressure of the national footballers did not get through the Czech defense, which responded accurately to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred college students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan created a human shield Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Isfahan where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest report that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There are reports of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities in Israel.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at destroying Iran’s nuclear program, the targets would be not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The Diet of an Obese Child: Doesn't Take Breakfast and Takes Sausage for Dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 years have problems with overweight, 9% of schoolchildren will be above average weight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment in which human beings are evolving and the models that surround them are.
On the tables of obese children, for example, cold meats are found 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had chips at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness-raising action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In families of large children, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from Czech primary schools.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third have enrolled in this project.
One of the decisive factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight and even obese children is the lack of proper diet and insufficient physical exercise.
"Only half of the children surveyed indicate, for example, eating breakfast five times a day - in case - lunch - tasting - dinner, which is a basic principle of a good diet," one of the results of the survey said.
Without breakfast and cold meats at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of students eat at the same time.
In the majority of families each eats their breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been noted is that a tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed more often.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned exercise regularly but for parents it is about half, only 15%.
Prepare Your Food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diets from the possibilities proposed according to their own taste and personal opinion.
“The preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating.”
Among their favorite dishes are plenty of cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is in particular a high preference for sugary lemonades," the results of the survey said.
For lunch it was the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
The children did not want starches at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Heading for Health
The survey also showed that children are willing to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
“During a control of a group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the ‘Obesity is not a coincidence’ awareness session, there was a determined willingness to move towards healthy eating,” the results of the survey indicate.
The most striking was, for example, with regard to sugary lemonades, as children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread or potato flour balls).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there were a lot of them from the start.
I wasn’t thinking about what would happen next.
Presentations by three professionals of the specialty, the dress of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it will be worse.
The closer we get to final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "drunk".
This time we have with the director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) dealt with how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, with no particular curve, another of overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically amenuate wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus managed to nicely emphasize the character and also not to dress too visually types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
For example, if there is a difference between the waist and the hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth having it made to measure.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is invaluable.
In a bespoke skirt you will feel much better than in one that constantly slips, rolls up and doesn't fit the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have the whole week to sort all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that given what I have to do at home, there's too much.
Each trainee was given a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of fashion of the personality as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress up" Miranda Kerr, who you may know of the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my heart, it makes me happy, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost a hundred pounds lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work on the graphics.
Moodboard, as they say for the end result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting also on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses the physical but creates, for example, productive pages in magazines (on given products trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphic designer, has taken care of all this.
But that, until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general view
Three specialty guests gave a diverse look to Saturday’s session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphic designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single garment in a different way.
Variability is paramount to this example.
As for example this trench coat that must be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with pumps and take it in photo as a dress.
Or just pull up the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start to contravene it," Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with them, towards what, why, when in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statements about fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben, that the stylist must have far more variations of clothing than the ones that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have ten pages (so ten models) I must be ready to "retail" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to count on this in the course of creating a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach towards the use of the services of stylists remains still frigid.
And known faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough for me to know something but what I look like moves to the second row).
And if someone gets a styling from us, then we have to rely on the fact that he dictates with a high probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we have to go on google and make sure if the boulevard info mentions the celebrity in question, if it has lost weight or grown etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
“When a manager asks you to sort out her closet and fill it with new items, you can’t throw it all away and say, ‘Oh my God, what a horror.’”
"You'll find some things that you'll find pretty and him that you'll advise with what to wear," Mario says.
This one has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
This is the one you hang around the waist and have on you for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, depilation rollers or nursing pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of clip they are not seamable).
So that we are not just people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could get damaged, fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently hurt ourselves.
So there is a real need for skills.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.
The account I'm talking about isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a short summary of what we learned during the second weekend of class.
I'm starting to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The need for speed The Run is fighting all over America.
Revision
Originally a problem-free race is transformed by a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with it in a routine morning trip to work.
It fulfills everyone’s ambitions to some extent, but it is useless if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitled part The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already aged Need for Speed racing series and to release a kind of game from the playable parts that would not count only with points.
So we were curious how the passages will be added during which the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already the case in the NFS series, the result is completely different than expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole is pulling down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of a laziness incomprehensible on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are caught up in an adventure whose main hero Jack has character problems and to settle them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The itinerary is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
The result is that each race takes place on a different route and the stages planned in different environments that stand out quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also pretty, even though the graphical technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
This is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in high snowy mountains is very visually pleasing.
The trials are also occasionally adorned with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly diminishes your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition to this, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you race against the clock (classic dual with the stopwatch) and then still awaits you another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the off-vehicle passages.
Rather, it’s an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help them by tapping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is quite like this because this element does not risk hindering and places itself, in the context described above, in the elements that decorate the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that there is currently nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said to be negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you will have to go elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything is ok.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
As the driving model differs, that of collisions is not yet at the point.
We do not expect complicated deformation and collisions from this game, but when you do not have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, so it is not completely good.
During tight overtakings you sometimes touch each other slightly, but otherwise your self-departure in crazy jolts.
Or it can be found in crumbs.
Thanks to the reboot system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The reboot is done so that when you have broken your figure or you have gone out in the decor the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used all 5 restarts you must start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go as it should, than something you can really rely on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and the solution must be found by remembering the piece of itinerary in question.
The big thing about this game is that the same actions end up in the same places.
For example, there are certain turns that you have to go through in a certain way or it will not happen.
Otherwise you meet on a given location "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What makes you angry are situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and contour them or brake them.
It doesn't matter if you meet him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always comes very close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
During all the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This irritates the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at all costs pass in front of you.
When it passes in front of you it hides the sight of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a good number of times.
It can be understood that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And that's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it doesn't matter if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during races.
You need to pay attention to gas pumps on routes because you can change cars there however most of the time you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, big American cylinders for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic rides on very technical driving for example on lace roads in the mountains.
And the challenge mode, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main diet of the story.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you reach the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog feature that, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other features in the community.
One of the hardest moves to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the metro tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you arrives a subway train that sends the car directly to the scrap.
At the editorial board we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about creating this game or whether the authors really think of us as fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
The problem is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This especially applies to accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging no longer serves you well.
The sound part is good and the track is your choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the most young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but we can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
Need for Speed: The Run is really confusing.
If the game didn’t have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game feels like it's not finished.
The fun is really good but prepare yourself for mistakes to hit you in the eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
The Velvet Students in concert with the choirs of the Charles University
The Festa Academica festival offers for the third time festivities that link the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs from upper and secondary schools.
The pinnacle of the festival is formed by two concerts organized on November 17.
"Charles University has an important role in this festival."
"Among the choirs there is the Choir of the Faculty of Education and Humanities, in the festival committee sits the rector Vaclav Hampl," says the leader of the organising team Jakub Calou.
The highlight of the festival is the concert of the High School and Secondary Class Choir, which takes place with free admission on 17 November from 2 p.m. in the space located in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program is the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evening the concert "Students of velvet" takes place in the premises of the National House in Vinohrady during which the choirs of the higher schools as well as that of the Charles University are performed.
The Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate with dignity the International Students’ Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the velvet revolution, but also to present to the public choir music of the highest level and to develop the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the Union of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Jan Kepler High School.
All the action is under the aegis of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Vaclav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The program also offers high-level concerts, music meetings, student happenings and other activities.
Interested parties will find all the information on the festival’s internet pages www.festacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically eliminated the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a tough war."
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," Milena Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law, the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different EU bodies and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers from the Charles University Faculty of Law might envy her, she showed how much she takes her motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, critics resonated that he's faded, that he's a round-of-leather, that he can't fill any mission and I have to say that he's breathtaking everyone because he's holding his role to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "Which phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater legibility of the EU's policy towards states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis, or organised an Eastern Partnership Summit.
It called the fall of the governorate very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has been in full swing" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved even now.
In addition, the new seventh budget of the Union must be approved, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and with a view to savings, which branch will take precedence, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted pickles, bananas differently large or even that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky.
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative aspect more than positively.
In addition, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, she said, stems from several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and the Czech side's weak support.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me, ‘Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?’ and he is not at all happy.”
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, the Member States are waiting for tough new rules on fiscal policy.
It is the concept of a Europe at two speeds, if not at several speeds, that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
“We have countries in the eurozone and others outside the zone.”
“We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation.”
In the first place it was said that the countries who want it and those who do not want it will cooperate with each other.
"There will be a lot of institutes of this type and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," said Vicenova.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all themes having an impact on the EU should be debated among all EU members and not only the members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If anyone were to look for the term that best expresses IBM strategy, the closest one would be “the long-term.”
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The foundation for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm’s first leader, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a lot of global problems can be solved as long as people are willing to think.
Its slogan "PENSE'!" became the imprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began editing in 1935).
This was the basis of Watson's culture of the healthcare company.
For us, IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous forward-looking movements.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it has always remained true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change all the others around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more"delayed for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, started caring for his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic -- the people at IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacation, employer-paid insurance plus a sleek employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and merchants.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was at the beginning brilliant in the discovery of talent--as one of the first firms to abolish all forms of discrimination and thus had a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM over the past few years has been doing what is called jamy, brainstorming online, from which a lot of future strategies and innovations have emerged.
No wonder he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a secure position in the field of business.
“From the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor of economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology," said Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is familiarly called in the United States because of its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest firms in the world.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services from server to nanotechnology.
It holds many patents from all American technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are, for example, the ATM, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the floppy disk.
This year IBM ended up with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
It is not all innovations and fabrications that have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example failed to wager on a proper operating system OS/2, the online Prodige service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on the movement ahead you can’t emotionally hang on to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this, IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms and when they don’t work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the competitor Microsoft, which stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A perspective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a dominant place.
However, still in 1990 it was with more of the participation motivated the strongest hardware representative.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in purchasing prospective technologies.
It continues in investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it has overcome the new financial crisis.
IBM is negotiating on the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Economic Crisis also increased its investment volume.
Is it now apparent that IBM is going through the current crisis without being concerned?
The price of the IBM share rose from 2008 in a rocket of 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
IBM History: From the slices of cheese to the robberies in the cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York 100 years ago; it originally had the complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 – originally a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is related to the year 80 of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of the firm - it was on Watson's ideas that the identity and culture of the company were built up to now.
Watson headed the Kusqu' firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In Watson's first four years, revenue increased to $9 million and the company began to expand to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of management it was his son who held the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the Moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began dealing with consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded at IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
IBM recently developed a “Smarter Commerce” platform that helps salespeople manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory as well.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that ass, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for the future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in summer to Bartosova in her house, she had no doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not repel the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
Over time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
“He’s the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out.”
"He will no longer be my old ass loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova said, showing that she has detached herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door for her is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife has set up a paper wedding and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we talk in a completely normal way but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop her.
“We don’t sleep together and it doesn’t interest me to know where she’s going, with whom, and if she’s having an affair.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” Joseph concluded.
Women’s Worst Vices: Does It Affect You, Too?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, everyone, both of them, is able to get them out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of female vices that manage to pump blood from the veins of men.
Procurement
Does your half remark to you that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing a week?
Are you happy to buy and in packages at the time of sale?
In your case, you can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which would resist the showcase lick of clothing stores, to look for nice clothes for yourself and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for men.
Just remember how many times you have told your spouse that he or she is waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I would need to lose at least 5 pounds - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don’t these phrases remind you of something?
Oh, yeah?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the issue that you should stop caring for yourself but a lot of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
The stronger sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become poisonous.
Cleanliness and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Wash the windows, vacuum, clean the floors, dust, peel the bathroom - and that twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he is walking with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have soiled the sink, soiled the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put that worn out sweater in the trash."
"Are you going to put on those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this work on your partner in this way several times a day, you’re really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn’t have to do so much sape work.
Defamation, persecution
Defamation, persecution as well as insults against someone are also characteristic of some women.
Women are particularly interested in relationships and are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets out a little harmless perfume here and there.
The hand on the heart is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, perceive, even despise others and are particularly dangerous for their surroundings - especially at work in a collective of women.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey striker Jagr twice competed in Philadelphia's victory during Monday's NHL match on Caroline's ice and is once again at the forefront of the productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player of the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told journalists from across the Atlantic that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," explained Jagr after his action Giroux scored a goal from the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the pallet and presented it to goalkeeper Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second half belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league, but he's really in the top three," Jagr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hokeyjista like him."
“I’m really happy with that.”
“I want to play on him.”
"All these years in the NHL the other players in the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she finishes with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended in two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the pallet, I took up speed and (Read) set off to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the final goal of the game from Voracek's point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo he came out in second third because of an injury to the upper body.
The Candians did not stand up to an experienced defender their two-goal lead and lost after a 2:3 penalty shot.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than losing the poins because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"That's not good."
“We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young people.
“But there’s nothing to do, it’s like that,” says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement wasn't enough and we couldn't resist."
“We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area.”
For that we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in Winnipeg's thirtieth attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, which stopped a series of 5 games lost.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel especially to the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a tendency towards the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for Czechoslovakia) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In the event that the Czechoslovakian citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West however it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good acquaintance" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The agreement for currencies that was the condition for traveling west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable, however, and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989, Czech travel has undergone a great revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at most, the Czechs spent the last year abroad 4 million days of holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The removal of visas in Western neighbouring countries in the 1990s caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by plane to the west which everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organisations slept Czechs in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or board.
The typical trait of a Czech trip at that time was to take with you your own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage have increased which caused around 1997 another important moment.
With increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have begun to prepare tours with air charters since 1997, which through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
At the end of the 1990s the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world except the US which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to completely join the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad including ancillary charges per person.
The general assembly must find its president but this risk ending in an unresolved situation "a pat"
Almost 5 months already Czech football is without a President and it risks that the successor of Ivan Hasek in charge of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after yet a general assembly to be held Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting rules to proceed.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for any of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football went back to divergences between the chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16, when it was necessary to choose a new president.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was not even talk of how to elect.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or also the officials with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that time with the help of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences still persist about the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also contributed nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The point of disagreement lies in either proceeding according to the statutes or finding another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Football Association, Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, in the third round, the candidate who has received the most percentage votes in the chamber for which he is a candidate wins.
Moravia is ready, according to what is being said, to withdraw so that the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only that would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian side and according to which it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees, even though he believes that the rules of the elections established according to the statutes benefit most Pelta among all the candidates.
"I hope that we will vote as much as possible in accordance with the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet any unsavory ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Meetings," said Victoria Plzen owner who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
"Today's possible qualification for the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"Football will be on a wave of happiness again and there will be more enthusiasm for cooperation," adds the Jablonec officer who among the three has the greatest experience in the direction of football both professionally and at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
“I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense.”
"This is not a problem between Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This can again cause a blockade at the General Assembly."
"I still hope that healthy reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some reunions should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell if the entire direction of football will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight on which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, among others, were scheduled to travel to Podgorica, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the field of reprisals.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parts within the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the fight for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asks for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigned for this high function.
“If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him, and I do not run for election.”
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from heading the AFRT, which would a priori be given a favorite for this election.
Paclik also points out that in case he wins the elections he would hold the position of President only until 2013 year planned for a General Assembly.
He would see in the role an experienced and high-level manager but who is not related to the world of football.
“I talked to people who would have the profile,” he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
“I would like to change that image,” he added.
Paclik is said to have been particularly impeded by the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of reverse renown who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable that Pelta holds this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, it would be even less favorable to football," Paclik said.
What shocks him again is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago during listening as part of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta came out without any pain.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be seen in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago, "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen club."
In the event that Paclik triumphs in Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been backed by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with."
“He has great abilities.”
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," said Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he voted for the cancellation of the Arbitrators' Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his abilities to lead private firms and that he has also led the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it.”
"I would curb the influence of certain interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," said Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy for Sparta leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power with high-level policies would lead to more money from gaming tax for sport.
"That's one of the key points that the new president should be dealing with."
"If it's the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going," he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT President should be "above the parties".
Pelta is linked again with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not the ideal."
"I don't see any reason to pass on my actions from the Plzen club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should end pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future the disputes over the rules for the elections.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and thinks that the success today of the football representation should calm this guerrilla before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which did not take place, promised precisely to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial means if he was elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay could well allow him to defend his vision of football leadership and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for Thursday to have a President.”
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is above all linked to the Jablonec club, has worked for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly the statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone realized."
"If there weren't all these various interpretations, we would have had a President since September," Pelta said.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has caught the full attention of the delegates.
“If I become president, I take it as my personal mission and I’m willing to take full responsibility in case it doesn’t work.”
"It's a principle without which we can't exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes with regard to his legal training and that he knows well that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He also hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who on the contrary keeps criticizing Pelta.
“He’s been playing football for a year and he’s already had a few successes.”
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta told his opponent but remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from competitions at the lowest level to national representation.
It should be a soccer showcase.
"And I would also endeavour to finish all the cases that begin with the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all the football," the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring about any change in people.
“I should get to know all the employees,” he told Strahov, where there has been understandable nervousness since there was no management.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round we will be able to overcome it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there's a new leader at its head," as Pelta optimistically said two days before the day likely decisive for his official career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would start working hard
"If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday, that would not please many people, it seems.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wants to make systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I want to take care of football in its entirety.”
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high-performance youth football."
"But I'm not saying I'm going to do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills on the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific area."
"And I'm going to deliver tough missions so that football can take a big step forward."
“Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others,” he added.
He reportedly did not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
“We know that I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know if it’s worth it and if I’ll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubt on each of my actions,” he said.
“A lot of people told me I shouldn’t give up because they would give up too.”
"It's a trust I can't betray," he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“Since the last two years there has been a lot of work done and I don’t want to let it down.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation in the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something Mirek Pelta can’t do.”
“Behind him are people who played football in such a way that he would only be for those who were chosen.”
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but certainly not to bear any one."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only with those who have been chosen.
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to consider splitting the second division into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, the winners of which would be in the first division."
"There wouldn't be a situation like it is currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem at the moment is to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I am constantly feeling support from the Czech House who has elected me as its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," Rajchl said, considering among his future successes saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, contract negotiations with television and on the gambling law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose its credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
“No one can doubt Plzen that he has done a great job this year.”
"If he were elected he would surely continue in what was begun by Hasek and would not make a noticeable change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl, who was evaluating his rivals.

A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
UFO optic patauries, beautiful swimming pools of Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after touring the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in soda baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the past 18 months, there’s one thing that shouldn’t be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Stretching on her back in the water, she watched the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor swimming pool pleased her, she immediately noted in her notebook all the interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she has presented them in her already published book: "BadeFreuden (Joys of the Bath). The municipal indoor swimming pools of Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiasm for bathing culture.
Meder explains that she doesn’t have much interest in the sport but he feels attracted to the water in a totally different way.
It is annoying that swimmers should be content to look at blue tiles and accommodate the smell of bleach water while joggers breathe the enchanting scent of spruce forests or can listen to the gag of cheerful birds from the park.
“I once wondered why swimming pools should actually always be so ugly,” she said.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dive in a pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight to the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a water surface in the swimming rooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, stepping stones.
The small-format image volume "BadeFreuden" makes a worthwhile 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to make a leap in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Next to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing waters in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Terdim) in a building that is filled with water.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zurich bath you have the whole city in your eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the piste.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of bleach does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulphur, from the <0xC3><0x81>rpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bath designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed.
Looking through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the blossoming of weeds between the tiles.
She observed a opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Thermal Palace of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only neo-Roman elements that emerge since its design in 1844 but also a Moorish hall in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its meticulous modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favourite bath of pool expert Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally from Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a good performance to merge such different building styles into such a formidable unit,” Meder says.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
German bank is examining commodity speculation in detail
Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its speculation on commodities?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on commodities such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation into the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that stock market speculation on global commodities pushes prices upwards and that banks share a complicity in global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is concretely aligned against the head of the Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way.
Raw materials speculation was originally introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that bettors have detached themselves from offers and demands - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from American competitors: he promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "no case is worth putting at stake the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the charges of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode hailed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculations about rising food prices show in a particularly drastic way how badly banks today are harming the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly obliged today.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation,” Bode said.
"It does not matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it is about hungry people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Group CEO wants to present a perfect image, a few months before he leaves office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything on the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would terminate commodity investments.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode released the survey Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires among 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which food price bets are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also derive personal consequences if they learned that their bank participated in such transactions: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43% would not advise such a bank to their surroundings, 49% responded that they would consider terminating their account to change banking establishments.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a happy end: the Austrian pavilion for world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and serves as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, glass sheds, lively and bold looks and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels is a good and famous example of this.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its light and suspended steel and glass construction.
Construction is considered to this day as an important milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian World Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the world exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the southern railway station of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for as long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and increasingly decayed.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "House of the 21st century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a shot of luck from any point of view.
The new beginning was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she has particularly carried out the work of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments, and she has obtained public funds.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookstore are located there, and an office is to be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was "an energy gulf," Krischanitz says.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, fiberglass reinforced insulating glass was laid and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridge beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements made room for the new operation, a panel of dimmed light between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - this is almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remained, the house is painted in a rust-protective shade of red-brown color.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also please the office of protection monuments," Krischanitz says and he draws attention to a crude soil underground.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and lightweight.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, “which came from Brussels,” Krischanitz said recently, a typical “Drop-in-the-City” story.
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the 21st-century house is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the newly planned "neighborhood of the central station", with offices and apartments.
And perhaps another lucky move will happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city in order to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year.
The Bild-Zeitung newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and of the rail network also in the case of extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, the number of internal and external employees for the snow clearance of railway facilities and docks is expected to double to 16,000 people.
The goal is to clear the docks of snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track devices required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, railway station chief Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference about train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company has had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had enough to do for years, given that it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more often at the workshop, after an axle rupture took place on an ICE in Cologne Central Station.
The German bank Deutsche Bank is paying millions of penalties in the United States.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this giant of the sector catches up with him in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Markets Regulator charges large banks with inciting cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost tremendous value during the financial crisis and drove the banks down.
"We are pleased that we have been able to find a solution on this issue, without the parties initiating proceedings in court," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
In comparison, the Bank has not acknowledged any faults.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US cooperative banks and acts in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred by billions of dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks aside and in the summer he sued JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The issue of mortgage documents is "mortgage-backed securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble erupted in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years old, at the moment there is a storm wind blowing on the American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous remedies to seek redress or to sanction infringements.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She accuses 18 major international banks, the two U.S. state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of having benefited in kind in about $200 billion mortgage deals.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, which involves several transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities demand that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without citing a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requests as unjustified and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett increases by $10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests huge sums in IBM’s IT business.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not to invest in IT companies, given that the long-term evolution of companies only reveals bad forecasts.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides IT services and systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
A Warren Buffett investment is considered a knight’s attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT business is granted the right to be now called "Mr. IBM".
Because Buffett revealed today to CNBC economic show, that he has since March bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM has never known anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services for some time now as an operating accounting centre.
The computer pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both Software and consulting as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in the companies he understands the business of.
But on the contrary, Buffett is attacking rail fret, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a number of large groups such as Coca-Cola and the Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small Berkshire Hathaway textile business in the 1960s and made it one of the world’s most prestigious companies through smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM shares rose by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also known as IBM, has a market value of more than $220 billion and is among the world's most valuable tech companies with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn’t want to participate in it.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "cell of Zwickauer" the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that would now be reborn.
The assassinations of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks, the spectrum that had long been thought dead has reappeared: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
That there is a xenophobia in Germany, it has never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose dimensions are far from predictable.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology", "That was the title of the internet publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the perpetrators was a v-man of the Constitution Protection, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right mud.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted reasonably: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony for the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports from some Turkish media have the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the murder series.
Therefore, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of unambiguous conditions.
"It starts to smell," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He points out that people were murdered, paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The police's action was perceived very critically on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier to the mind of the German authorities to do research in certain suspicious extreme right-wing circles, the authors are astonished.
More than one is ready at least for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be sloppy, there will be nothing left to migrants but self-defense and armament."
"It will be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," Selen wrote.
What it means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, that mistrust and distance through acts of violence could lead to.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past, it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks that the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population was producing.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax burdens.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the distrust of many Germano-Turks towards the local rule of law has been since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and reassess far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time around.
The scandal bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and in the meantime patina from one crisis to the next.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was known in July that he would hold an almost equally spectacular position in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber has publicly rejoiced, praised; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently obtained strength and has passed kind remarks on future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as of September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the Bank’s security systems and burned about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the board of directors of the UBS has since been regarded as suffering - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the presidency already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is becoming difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
At once he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, UBS is huge on one side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating from scandal to scandal for years.
Nothing, it seems, saves the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, had combined it with ambitious goals: it also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later banking professor for many years in Zurich says: "I always took the UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
“In the current perspective, one asks: How could I have been just so wrong?”
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007 it became apparent that for the first time something was not going around at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli surprisingly retired, who was previously regarded as a top intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later, we knew why he had left.
The division of the bank had flared with sub-prime documents and had to cross billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this it has indeed found investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was silenced, to the point that its name was never even learned.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank was expected to announce billions of losses once again, withdrew Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still Switzerland’s second highest-paid board in 2006.
In October 2008 the catastrophe followed: the UBS was, given its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The Swiss National Bank has bought tens of billions of problematic securities from the UBS, the Swiss Confederation has donated six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to house such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 amounted to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second followed.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had surrendered because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself willing to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who had defrauded the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in reimbursement of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS published more or less that it had helped with tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the wealthy clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the Chief of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, in a few months the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to poor speculation and asset management due to tax fraud assistance.
And, as there was a bit of a return to calm, and as it was thought, that the UBS would get away with it, it followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single title merchant flames 1.7 billion euros, before the bank noticed that something was not going around.
And it is published: with risk management in investment banking it still does not seem to work.
"With the case of Adoboli, we have found that risk management has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure: "The problem with the UBS is that it does not have control over the risks."
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long assumed their function, that of becoming the guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers such as Tiffany's can be found here among the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss bankers have lived here for centuries: from the national bank through the Credit Suisse Palace to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another departed from the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small private Swiss bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS would have become far too large, he finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would have spread further.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
"And yet, they have long since adapted to the Anglo-Saxon customs."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"On Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," author Lukas Hässig wrote in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks entered into a huge group.
A bank was set up, which was already too big for small Switzerland - and has seen a steady increase.
What helped was that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich, but lethargic bank with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer, but already stronger internationalized one.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorably access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” said bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who understands it very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has made his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have relied until the end on Wuffli.
And wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The staff of UBS clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders at which the head of the Wuffli group always said the same slogan: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which documented at that time the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go to the top.
Some stages have already succeeded.
It has played a very important role in foreign exchange and securities transactions.
The corporate advisers, who were responsible for it, however, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the larger banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packed and passed on valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages — but also retained risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking to go down.
“While the U.S. real estate market was still on fire in the summer of 2007, UBS bought there,” said banking expert Geiger.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when ending the attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and have so far been banking.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger, already has an idea: to put an end to investment banking, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as this is clear so far.
Next Thursday the head of bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank parted with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has established itself: it must lead the business of UBS sustainably, the Bank of Zurich said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress of the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He has only so far publicly stated that he and his wife were going to look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe over the weekend has discouraged US investors.

U.S. investors expressed themselves skeptically: "We are not an island, on the other hand, dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was in his view too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the winds and entered the American technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the stock price of this traditional group, and allowed him to score nearly more than 1%, against the trend of commercial management.

Smart Crows Spread in Cities
In many places, freaks are considered a "bird problem" but experts say these very intelligent animals have not been hunting cities for a long time.
Some love them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have been in the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are increasing because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote against the "° bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to drive the freaks out of cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
The protectors of nature also based the problems of cities on the exodus of particularly protected frex: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional life spaces.
Hunting, designing and slaughtering typical hatching trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large settlements with more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project gained negative publicity because of the crow slaughter in that region.
Critics have found catching birds in traps and killing them with particularly brutal cuddles.
"Normal expulsion, eviction, is useless," said Leer city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
Destroying nests with water under pressure or cutting down trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals move away, large colonies divide, and they disperse in other places.”
Eviction is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
“We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them.”
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of eviction of animals with an aversive packaging and catchy offers, in order to allow them to resettle elsewhere.
A psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens was prospecting "info signs instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "Finally, we can better withstand a pimple on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-Trail-Educational Baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent freckles.
In the meantime, this project has been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on criticism of noise caused by birds: "Here's a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: The freux not only use instruments of work to arrive at a treat, but they themselves manufacture their tools as instruments of work.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge recently tested four freries about how intelligent birds are.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they definitely recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second trial, the cunning crows then had to solve a more confused problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their booty with their beak.
However, the researchers had put pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they caught the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four frexes are even successful from the very beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a coup by the Bosniaks and Turks remained unsuccessful.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czechia and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the playoffs of the 2012 European Championship in Poland and eliminated Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal deceived against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0:0 of the game, his fifth European championship appearance.
The Czechs reached the play-back match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was even hotter in the 0-0 draw between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-meter penalty played by hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was faced with a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free-kick 30 meters in advance into the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his distance shooting qualities and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the Manchester City English championship, initiated a headball directed down the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for Czech Republic
Finally the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the centre of all attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark granted an 11-meter penalty played by the controversial hand after a move by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic probably diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for the fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to survive a shocking moment in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface just next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the world-class keeper of the Czechs already shot down, again, the forward of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the Zagreb football miracle during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb couldn’t go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the 2002 EM third bench in the same way, the Croatians were able to look forward to their fourth round in the European Championship final.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost made up for a dream departure.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd Minute, the legionnaires of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish are celebrating their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni’s team, who had already taken over with a 4-0 success the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for the visitors.
Ireland pushed higher from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Los Angeles Galaxy’s Robbie Keane got the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that the defence of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the -first scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and squeezed the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars ($1.5 billion) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” CEO Bill McDermott announced to its customers on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this rapidly expanding country.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.
SAP expects to increase sales to €20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfer recorded revenues of nearly 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked so well.
SAP has been active in China for over 20 years.
“Now, we want to expand our business ...,” McDermott said.
"Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
The personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity, titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War", it begins with a long list of characters that hold your heart.
A tip to get started: carefully rip this page and make it your bookmark.
In this novel by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book which he accurately describes as "an anti-history work."
It includes a few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and materials.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like." We find in it the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance workers and vendors.
Some will become heroes.
Others are prisoners of war. Some will lose limbs, go crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives wander here like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are reignited.
Peter Englund’s book deviates from traditional history books.
It denies the idea that the First World War can only be summed up by the terrible trench war on the Western front.
"Beauty and grief" skillfully describes other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; Tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina smelling cordite.
When cannon blows sound in the distance, and you are a house mother, do you stay or are you fleeing?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been enhanced by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them talk about deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, überall ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It continues on replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a fake wood bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
It states that "837 permitted substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honor and courage.
One American acknowledges his own drive towards savagery and declares about war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there's no empese behind it.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is in danger of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
“When you are resigned to sacrifice, you hope to have an audience,” he wrote.
This is unfortunately rather comparable to "a convicted man strangled in secret."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"Conflict becomes more and more a story of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as there is heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread over the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into lifelong blindness."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund’s prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures the way in which war has “triggered forces exclusively uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West" rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have ever read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, grabbing this page with the list of people in your hands and burning it with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained a secret from all but a few high-ranking officers and others informed from the outset that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could have been no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which went against the department’s regulations and spawned a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean up Zuccotti Park from its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared by observing the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was held on Randall Island, with a view to operating at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots – anti-terrorist measures that involve moving large numbers of police quickly – to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move around the park arrived "at the last minute," said one regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise."
“The few police officers I know who have been called did not know that they would go to Zuccotti Park,” he said.
"The only ones who know they would go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighborhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people would come and go to the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages from speakers appeared to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windproofs, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving the occupants time to collect their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said the move was taken solely for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, rudely held by the officers.
Browne said the TV camera trucks on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward across the thick business rush of protesters, including luggage, plastic grass and bags of cloth-filled sheets, sanitation department teams followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away and the images were posted on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp clung together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut off the locks.
No arrests took place in the park until 3.30 a.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for "disruption to public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most ranked officer to have found himself at the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct the operations," Browne said.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of intervention needed.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street in the south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, were reportedly even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, while others were seen smashing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood emerged flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The school aid union sues the city for layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school aides who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory layoffs, disproportionately impacting schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the 37th District Council union in an attempt to overturn the layoffs.
Sixty-seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees, among the lowest-paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7, and union leaders compared the layoffs to political revenge for not allowing the city access to a worker-run health care fund that would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, noting that the dismissals of school aids were not specified in the budget.
37th District Council officers said they would fill out a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits at Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the City Department of Education will be the defendant, and the complainants will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all black or of Latin American origin, like most school aides who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of dismissals in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa facilities, 17 school aides lost their jobs in Brownsville's 23rd District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aides at Harlem's 36 public school, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, prosecutions say "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget shortage."
The 36 public school budget was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo used the term "exceeding" to describe the action, although "exceeding" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parent coordinators have been fired," and "not just because of overrun."
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on Libya issue
In the end, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat-Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican-Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent-Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and US troops for their "courage."
“This resolution is about honoring the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House clashed over the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not approving the U.S. military role in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to allow the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a move to cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his foot.
Congress' indecision has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee’s resolution “congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination towards freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure gain full support from the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide legislators as it did last June?
Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of a new project.
Within the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on a constitutional amendment to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but that is not without having tried.
Goodlatte's amendment is among the 68 constitutional amendments to be presented to Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of Commons of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters—notably new Republicans who want to give their CVs gold—the chance to brag about being the “author” of such a move.
The Budget Control Act passed last August called for the House and Senate to vote on the amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is constantly proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to allow the annulment of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose it.
As eager as members have been to propose amendments, they are not as quick as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The rate slowed from the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
'Massaged but not beaten' Gabrielle Giffords Says in Her First TV Interview Since Shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords appeared Monday night on a television show, singing "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" on Broadway and saying she wanted to recover first of all rather than return to Congress.
When she appeared in the "20/20" television newspaper on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show addressed his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and called her recovery “difficult.”
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, responded “pretty well.”
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during an hour-long special edition of “20/20,” aired the day before the couple’s new book, “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special broadcast traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he was spotted on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a wide scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair as doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign from the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask her to change the menu for her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with the doctors as Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin"?
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours with doctors every day, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information for the first time about the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
“There have been a lot of deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, “I was beaten.”
"So I'd say, 'Gaby, you weren't beaten,'" Kelly said.
You were just slaughtered.
And you're gonna get out of it, recover and come back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for New York City’s homeless veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in a tie-suit stood at his feet to cheer him.
“The military, men and women, are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, the organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military at the gala, in which Admiral Mike Mullen, chief of staff of the United States Armed Forces, also participated, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were presented as some sort of orphan,” the senior military official wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know. I know.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have settled between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, some military officials say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they are sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves into the role of unlucky spirits."
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unthankful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place confidentially among veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant countries.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who took him through the interviews were subtly asking if he would be able to stand up to the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after he returned from the fight.
“When you approach the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions,” recalls Colonel Cancian as he talks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely congratulated by a country so unfamiliar with the military and which sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as in World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of a soldier’s suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of periods of service endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a major hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant on the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texas has put aside its concern.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
“I should have followed my intuition.”
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her from behind, thrown to the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still on duty and some not, will be anxious to wait for the court ruling at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial will take place against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
They are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape within the army, thus infringing on the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number amounted to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also allege that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke claims to attack the galloned military, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders."
The lawyer also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will file several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not liable for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
"The alleged wrong is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents indicate.
The Department of Defense refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely solely masculine.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, notably in contacting local women.
Out of these two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in combat.
It's time for the army to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three more trials are underway in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynist atmosphere.
On the other hand, the nonprofit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a rights group for women in the military.
His group filed a trial in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for those who report sexual assault at the service.
Nine separate bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported by the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated because, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report published in March also looks at the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the military were the subject of a trial - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants of Susan Burke’s case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her assailant's blood - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sits before a judge at a trial where she is questioned about her sex with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as moral witnesses to the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was handed down,” Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
“I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember telling my commander, ‘This was not his trial, it was mine.’”
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed under less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any advantage.
Whether or not the Lyman case and the other plaintiffs will go forward is a long story,” said John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents posed by responsibility.
"The odds are heavily against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things change only when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she said.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls Have Eyes: Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far-right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being caught in a deadly madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik was acting alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time leading up to the attack on his computer, chatting with a few of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is packed with so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific precision — the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett’s team discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. They targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer a survey. Questions asked were about their level of education, their attitudes towards violence, and their optimism about their own future.
By getting in touch with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens.”
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new must-have tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues such as social trends, thanks to “Like”, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three contents per day, the “data supernova” generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research work whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to conduct investigations into people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in,” Bartlett said.
“Facebook avoids all of this – you have direct access to their information.”
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and colleagues, young students who talked about their drunken exploits on Facebook were considerably more likely to be alcoholics than discreet students.
Megan Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and eventually intervene to help a student whose status would too often talk about alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied statistics on the love situation and Valentine's Day, the turnout rate in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its treasure trove of data available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is something else online.
"I don't think a large number of users have ever thought of the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students' Facebook walls.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,” Selwyn said.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and pen are still the best tools to use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social is not in front of a computer."
"Cold and Inhuman" by Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance fighter” during his first appearance at the Oslo trial.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Norwegian Templars,” he said in front of a courtroom filled with 500 people.
"With regard to the jurisdiction of the court, I deny it because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts, but I'm not pleading guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "didn't want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for another twelve weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the trial ended.
"I found it cold and inhumane," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian television station NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally moved forward a bit after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark costume and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial and looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as they entered and left the courtroom.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not insane. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some of them.
But this does not reduce the sorrow or confusion felt by the whole nation.
“I would have preferred that he looked like a monster, but that’s not the case,” said a relative of a victim.
“It would have been much easier.”
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs' Lost Interview at the Movies This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some have compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will air this week in the first part of a film on major markets, is how well this creative mind understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a flowchart enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from a "great illness that makes them think that a great idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates an idea.
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traces the birth of the computer, and he sat down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years since Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple, already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs’ death that a full video was found in the director’s garage.
This video, slightly elevated, is the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will air in theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism resurfaces, when he seems eager to hear Cringely’s questions, giving him elbows to speed him up and move on to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision for the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them then the implementations immediately.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences from Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
“Throughout all these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why are you doing things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to elaborate on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how costs were recorded - it often starts with a "standard cost" assessed at first glance and then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured the accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a turn at the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack phone networks and call for free over long distances.
The device has been the subject of many writings beforehand, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and you screamed in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later at the public phone next door,” Jobs says, laughing.
“We were young and with this Blue Box we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn’t both know much, but we invented a little thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to recount a wonderful ride he and Wozniak have come up with: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett’s demarche):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a phone call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP’s employees to visit the company’s research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first desktop ever designed.”
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a glance.
Early in his career, as he settles down to sell a few PCBs, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 credit days, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember some big fights... they screamed at me that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that proved incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are breathing out:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would be mistaken and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you worked at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copy machine or a better printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing can evolve it, so [these are these kinds of people] that end up leading businesses and product-specialized staff are put away from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product versus a bad product - the required manual labor.
This is what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire IT industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They snatched defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge part of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to be made... Some things you can’t do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made out of personal taste. It's about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring those things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health law as court meets
The day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to discuss the issue of political disagreement, whether opposition to President Obama’s health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case in the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question involved a 26-state trial challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, because a monumental 5:30 argument is expected next March, and the result will likely be likely to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming by the time the court’s decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue against the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general of the United States during the George W. Bush administration.
Clément’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was among the two dozen law firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to upholding conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another proponent was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
It included Mitch McConnell, a top Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health law.
The star guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would arguably argue by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers from organizations related to law and others although the judge cannot be an intervener, an honorary guest, or appearing on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts statements by several judges that the Court abides by the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have pending cases in court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event removes any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives claim that it is Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was solicitor general of the Obama administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the level of the court of first instance.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had been too involved in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record $18 billion order for airliners
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777s, two-way airliners, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order for 50 of its products.
However, it is quite a case when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $ 18 billion.
Equally incredible is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago airline estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need in the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing reported on the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 two-aisle aircraft.
The Emirates airline based in Dubai placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total order amount to $26 billion.
Boeing, on the other hand, said on Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers.
The amount of these six aircraft is more than $1 billion.
“This is clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So not only do they have the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their biggest costs - would not be so detrimental to them as the country would make money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point as these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their aircraft orders when the price of oil rises, Dihora said.
“They have natural risk coverage,” he said.
Emirates’ order reinforces Boeing’s predominance in the large-carrier market and helps curb the attempt to encroach on competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aircraft Show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the largest version of the A350, which directly rivals the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing back its beginnings to increase its thrust as customers demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of Mexican President Demonstrably Beaten in Michoacán Elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says the drug traffickers helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race to the post of governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her attempt to take over as governor of Michoacán in violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
Early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the forefront of the race to the post of governor of that western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon told the radio during an interview Monday following the election.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... They took the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until losing the presidency in 2000.
But he is organizing his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out from Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother’s Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, leftist candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection to drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet the violence persisted.
A week before the elections a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates resigned locally to the campaign out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would impede the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the director general of the Manila-based BASD, said the two fastest-growing economic powers in the world must “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He discouraged the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) from looking at Europe’s difficulties with an “indifferent eye” and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe’s leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all together in this crisis.”
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not safe.”
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the global economy will return to recession, and has prompted a call from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would route any Asian aid, but he also said that bilateral assistance – such as buying bonds from the U.S. Financial Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater negotiating power to Europe’s Asian partners.
India's Minister of Commerce and Industry, Anand Sharma, said "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and agitated,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe for the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.
"One day they will find that the Greeks retire at 50 and go on holiday in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the eurozone crisis could have “significant repercussions” across Asia.
BASD’s forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 is now facing “risk of loss” due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop “rescue plans” to protect themselves from economic reversal and significant capital leaks.
Severe Pentagon warnings about potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields, including gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 or more cuts is imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting in so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
“Such a significant reduction, applied indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and construction projects unexecutable — you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or vessel — and severely undermine other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote.
"We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparedness."
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
"Although wartime financing of foreign contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruption to core budgets," Panetta said.
"The contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and oversight of contracts that support the war."
“Staff managing wages would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.”
“We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as Panetta’s letter was released.
“It’s not a consequence we can live with, and it’s certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves.”
“Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself reached the Pentagon’s highest position accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what could happen - a soldier with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter jet without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don’t have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission,” Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
“It’s a depressed force, unprepared and unable to deal with potential opponents.”
"De facto, she calls for aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could “generate significant operational risks: delays in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could move to the couperet, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines shows how pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies have destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has been billed as an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of campaign funding violations related to covering an extramarital affair.
And then, none of those who have lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legionary.
There have been instances where teachers have given test responses to students in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to shout: "I got you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research of such projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the research findings is that the earliest myths about lying have been debunked.
The liars look you in the eye.
They do not stutter, blush or shake.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the statement structure, facial micro-expressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast and still emerging body of knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are adept at reading others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more “centered” lies while women tell more “centered” lies—usually to protect someone’s feelings—that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called “establishing the benchmark data.”
This helps provide a reference point for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, the voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally shakes their feet constantly so as not to throw unfair accusations when you see them shake their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues to verbal and non-verbal misleading behavior.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Misleading people can immobilize the upper body when trying to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, lean towards an exit, change posture significantly, or present post-interview relief - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a posture change when all the difficult questions have passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to try to trigger the post-interview response.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
Famous Scott Peterson slipped off using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Misleading individuals may also use distant language: "I have not had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or fully repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember right... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial Pipeline Plan Will Be Confused After Threat of Late U.S. Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico — sparking anger from unions while calming environmentalists — the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to put it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain the approval of an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and Ogallala Aquifer, vast groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have postponed any decision until 2013 after next year's elections, although officials deny the policy's implication in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do this, it would have to cross six states.
He is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan are pushing for a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only pose limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that diva Disco Patti LaBelle, thrown into a flurry of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, frightened their little girl to the point where she vomited in fear.
"Lady Marmalade's tirade has frightened 18-month-old Geneviève Monk to such an extent that she has undergone "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his nursery teacher wife Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk went to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and posed her daughter for a while.
“Someone came behind me and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and went to get her,” she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman with anger.
“She said to me in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,’” says Roseanna Monk.
“I said, ‘What you say or think doesn’t interest me.’
She became angry and began to use swearings - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling water on me from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother – who was still holding Genevieve in her arms – and had to be held back by her entourage who drove her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so loud that she started to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note asking for LaBelle's apology, but got no reply.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a charity against cancer for the children.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During Mario López Valdez’s first year of management, unemployment and informality increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment fell and the economy contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, that generated high expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase in economic indicators is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the
February's low temperatures, apart from causing trillion-dollar losses to the agricultural sector, have limited the opportunities of the state's economy for growth, caused a contraction in overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost allocations issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, according to the rate of unemployment in the state during the first three quarters of the year has been observed an accelerated increase, because while from January to March 55 thousand 053 signanoens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent to the second quarter of the population.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly depending on the actions carried out by public policy.
“What we observe is a rise in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who make dollars in an illicit way it is not easy that they work to earn them, that they invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes said the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
“The number of people leaving the state to go abroad to work in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of entry difficulties and secondly because when entering they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people stay here and ask for work sources, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Lack of seriousness
According to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the employed population in the state work there without paying contributions as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Aside from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for lag for the state is low wages, the entity has the lowest pay in the country, according to the registries of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly income of the workers of Signano was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which lies at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Aside from declining economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the State FDI reached $630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent from the previous year of the same $5 million 143,312 recorded.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State requested in July at the public congress the approval of a loan of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the congress of the State was 2,600 trillion pesos and no savings were observed until November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employers' sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés' government demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year was really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our effort, we had to align the effort of all and especially the good work already synchronized of this new government team, hopefully next year is much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events like the frosts at the beginning of the year held back the state’s economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, among which frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state to productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms, we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa is unlocked," he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channeled the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to be done," he said.
Condemned for 8 kilos of marijuana
A person living in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fine for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic has informed that the small trafficker convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for an offence against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana intended for sale.
In accordance with AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was driving in a white pick-up truck, in which he carried a black bag in the luggage rack of the vehicle and in the co-pilot's seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Enforcement of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debt to contributions to works
The social works contemplated in programmes such as Habitat, Rescue de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantas may not be finished where to record serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that, although the construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk because the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is a possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end they have given us nothing, even if since July they had to give us part of it," he said, "and we, in order not to record any delays, we started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided at that time.
“We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year, in order to be able to access these programs, we had to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid,” he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the managements so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide nearly 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have given us nothing."
The Court validates the "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals with digital one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the House of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogous cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television a reality.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, because the radio and television regulations are reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
In favour of the project only voted Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero same.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the implementation of the decree and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of ministers also resolved to reject the complaint made by the House of Representatives, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister-President said that he disagreed with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also do not consider that if he did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of state leadership.
The substitution of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this translates into better radio spectrum exploitation, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing change, he argued, would be postponing the benefits of digitalisation that involves a decision in the public interest that not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had the highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress in a form, for it ensures in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative, he assured.
The possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoacán is analyzed
According to data highlighted by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6,000 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Outcomes Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6,000 74 minutes to.
In this sense, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, last November 9th, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoacán did not homologate either its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the statutory deadline for this electoral process to come into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel had omitted its publication within the deadlines stipulated by the State's Official Gazette Act.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the vote of the state's proxy for constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because he has no right to "sanction or contest" them.
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to make partial and total counts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no polling minutes and counting in the file of the ballot box is not at the president of the ballot box; or there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all ballot boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the respective election and the one who obtained second place in the election is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition of the party representative and/or
The total vote count may also be realized if at the end of the common count it follows that the difference between the alleged winning candidate and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate came out second, in which case the electoral packages that have been the subject of the party count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the Lieutenant Colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving tributes from the others who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés’ family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the Lieutenant Colonel’s ashes arrived at the vigil chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes to the Institute of Technology of Saltillo organized by his former colleagues of technological baccalaureate and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part when preparing for the baccalaureate.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and that his ashes be spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he has always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared very much for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very early to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it, because they said he even had a truck pain; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his parent, for this he knows that his uncle dies doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His Last Farewell
With honors it was said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute which was led by Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Technological Institute and the Director of the Mexican Air Force's Studies.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he piloted crashed alongside the government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all of whom were officials of the service.
The remains of the Saltillo-born Bacio Cortés arrived (incinerated) at 6:05 p.m. to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his parents, his mother and other brothers.
Three abandoned corpses, located on the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered by gunfire fired in different parts of the body and with the stroke of grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at the 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, approximately three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side was another one with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At a distance of one meter there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on the belly.
According to data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another location because no sockets were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by a crime group organized towards each other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the published information, in a first fact on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and managed to save one who had been deprived of liberty.
They were confiscated from three buildings and a cellphone; they claimed that they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another fact that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel made a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without license plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently, and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00, one of his accomplices was arrested at La Frauda, when he tried to escape while seeing the military.
They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the entire Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in its majority of technocrats, even if it is unclear when the new executive will assume his post.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner for Journalists said.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "framework is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to levels impossible to support.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Noting the pressure on Monti to hurry, the market instability placed the yield of Italian bonds BTP at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers’ group Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: “We said we would strongly support this government.”
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, to which the crisis forced him to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocrat-majority government that Monti formed.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure, noting that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations.
He will finish his reunion tour Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 convened by the two countries for today's friendly, at 15:05, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, account for an ample register of inter-selection Class A games, the Tricolor only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have all 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) against Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain year-round intense activities in national league and cup championships and disputes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated European Cup and World Cup qualifiers.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have limited international experience to one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish national team is that of goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) matched the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international games.
Casillas will play against Tricolore today and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona brain steering wheel, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized by UEFA the previous week alongside the other 100-year-olds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke's front-center, Raúl González, with 102.
The 100-year-old figure is loaned to Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
From the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana, there is left-back Júnior Díaz, with 48 appearances and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still starting out.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz recorded the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to perform one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group asserts that for them it will also be a dream come true to happen in this country.
Bassist and founding member Jeff Ament ensured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The band is in the South American wing of its two-decade work celebration tour and will make its one-stop stop in Central America on Sunday.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles band The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will be happening in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I only stayed in Costa Rica once the holidays; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to spend a few days there.
We are excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying beside us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to be spent until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve offered over the past 21 years have taken place over the past two weeks.
We have offered two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope it has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we learned, through the people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you aves offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never produced ourselves there, we have no restrictions as to what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is the reason for this?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and everyone loves different songs, which is why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to perform each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t performed in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and why we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don’t think any of us ever imagined that we were going to be a great rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for over 20 years makes it feel like a dream.
We continue to recount our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together thrills us a lot.
We love each other and we love creating music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of large groups.
We are very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
“Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to still be friends with them all and it’s an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours stands together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that’s a lot longer than many bands normally last.
Firstly, I believe we are all lucky to be still alive and secondly, we all care for others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don’t spend too much time touring because it’s easy to fall into this game from large crowds and people who love your music.
If you don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect the music and what brought it, without thinking of the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which is not really interested in any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We’ve been a band for nearly three years and we didn’t release a record before Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There has been a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and most importantly, we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work with.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and this one was the band we liked the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
It is he who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge relevant despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the bands that came up at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first, his music had more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is the cause of this change?
That’s interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that are called very obscure songs, even though they may sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there’s a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think that one can be happy and even that way one can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in the feet, his family doctor informed.
Fujimori, 72, who serves a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including language cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
It has been operated on four times for tongue cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving time in the National Directorate of Special Operations since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and bosses, will initiate a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point on a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residents in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "suitable for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations," according to information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that prompted the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has been trying in recent years to push the realization of tax exchange agreements to get out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 'gri list', integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustache plumber goes to the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives in stores around the world this month, was designed from the beginning to take full advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses,” Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, Nintendo’s press officer in Spain, said during the video game’s presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this support", because hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a fast and smooth gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang out the less skillful users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second lap" at the levels of the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This foray into the three dimensions of Super Mario also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that had not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo nods to the fans of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustache plumber has to go through platforms mined with danger to free Princess Peach.
Even though I player find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus the trial ends so that Guatemala responds to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to try him.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision is based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and he had given effect to all extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did requires an executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional forums to judge the former 2004-2004 proxy.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted for misappropriation of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
Added to this is the long centenary of jobs currently being achieved by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock of an event celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats that more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are under-educated, without work, with addiction problems or marginalized.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the midst of the electoral season, showed the unity of Trinijove’s work.
Alongside the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the act was attended by the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to the mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Charity Director General of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended in the grand hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example to deal with bad circumstances and to give hope to people in trouble.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro parties, evacuated
The invaders had seized 11 of the building's 13 apartments, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Balmes Street were living has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned yesterday at noon the building they were illegally occupying and where they organized micro-feasts that were desperate to the neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
“From that day on, there will be access control,” the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially alcoholic beverage boxes.
The first three apartments were the scene of the mass celebrations, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the occupancy of the building his business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made her unfairly competent, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreational space had had to respond to complaints from neighbors about the noise, while, according to her, the troubles were not caused by the guests of the disco, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially the participants of the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The manager of the disco explained that the troubles were so great that she even ended up in an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months that he "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of life in common and civil that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were thefts as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in property".
Yesterday, too, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the advisability of the call beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors once again opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed Collserola promotion posters.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in numbers, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the WBC in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the City Hall convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for all access doors in Collserola.
A door returns to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors on the field.
The question arises by itself: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this former caste of elect speak of when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on the "mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the blocks of green houses has not been completed.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the most extensive park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the verdict of the architect for which the title of "doors of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one should not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
Perils that derive from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and that had in the area of the Forum "his song of a swan".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
“Limiting something means already establishing the next step,” that is, overcoming it.
“We need to think about new planning and planning tools, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can cause real disasters.”
By sticking more to the question, Modol thinks that, simplifying, the slope of the region El Valles de Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Board of Trustees of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduit that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success," he says) that one had to create: "We, the architects, should only be an instrument".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the basis of the competition there is a lack of an overall vision of Collserola: "We called 16 cross-country competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he has opted to participate in all 16 contests.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can clash in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In his opinion, yes, the City Hall should ensure that the band immediately above that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, Casino Red’s legal base has granted pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail.
After spending 72 years in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founder of the legal power of Casino Red grants him pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which presumably Manuel Jonás demanded the payment of an economic quota for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the brother of Mayor Paniste and on 2 September he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 for Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was issued a second arrest warrant after the Public Prosecutor's Office had rejected the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadereyta penal center allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the middle-security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, a arrest warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonas' guilt, such as the one relating to the cashing out of 1.5 million pesos of gambling house representatives in exchange for allowing its operation.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, stood before the judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could regain his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Prosecution Officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, interrogated García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who of the associates of the gambling house had been the one who had granted forgiveness, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under file 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is granted legal pardon and subsequently no claim can be made in relation to the trial against him; no compensation for the damages and no punishment will be asked either.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours, the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, traveled to the prison in the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally pardoned and his file would be filed.
It will also inform him of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome communicates the details of the air accident in which lost his life the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter crashed directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements for transporting personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations made in the impact zone do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In research, it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was structurally present.
“The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for carrying them.
The floor had a pane of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For now, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can take a few months, it can even take a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Managing Director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the moment of impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was operating at cruising speed and this happened on a soft ascending ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, TBS holder Pérez Jácome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft advanced to the boundary area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-rise layers of cloudiness.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloudy conditions the crew sought a lower height area and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably prior to the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remnants in a reduced area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The dispersion model of the aircraft remains makes it possible to assume that the helicopter hit the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion have been detected:
At the site of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple ground contacts.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above average sea level, the ground had a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarticulated himself along his journey.
The information provides evidence that appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a wider area than the encircled area, around the accident, no dispersed parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Insurance conducts an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called the 'genetic protocol of obesity of children and adolescents' that will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry at the Specialty Hospital of the 20th Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
During the investigation, people with or without rights are invited to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence for minors is made every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sportive Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sportive Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the purpose of this investigation is to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young people in Mexico to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific dietary questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (seeking to identify people associated with childhood obesity) will be applied to all participants.
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there was a 77 percent increase in obesity for boys and 47 percent for girls; when it comes to overweight, there was also a dramatic increase," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population is different from others by its genetic history.
On average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American, 30 percent European and five percent African inheritance, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which allows to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, doctors give it to the parents in writing, explaining each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transportation instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - cornmeal meat paste wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200,000 blackcurrants each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the construction and maintenance of the same bituminous pavement is adequate, blackcurrants could be reduced.
During his conference A Technology Opinion on Blackcurrants, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture having characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and consequently, the formation of blackcurrants.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that on the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the majority of the streets of Ciudad de México were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it generating forces, it allows the forces to propagate very well in the pavement.
If modified asphalt were to be used, it would spread better, the chemical engineer said.
On the layer of asphalt, he says, one puts a last layer called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip on the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the bearing layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material of which it is made must be cared for.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer it is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and consequently causes blackcurrants.
In the process of forming a blackcurrant, he says, the first that gets spoiled is the rolling film and only subsequently is affected the layer of asphalt, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrant and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrant.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to research and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her title number 14 as a princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico climbed with the crown and the scepter, the department already sums 14 titles of Princesse and Melina, one to a legion of women from Valle del Cauca that found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949).
Today the big question that many people ask is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been in vain elected Queen of the Police and Best Pretty Face of Vogue, titles obtained by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the Miss Crown
The first factor considered key in the juror's decision to nominate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of Valle’s candidate to this question:
“I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it’s a form of culturalization, definitely I believe the book that marked my childhood is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
Now I'm reading Crime and Punishment, it's a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I'm reading Irene Nemirovski's book, a Russian, a very beautiful book called The Burning of Blood.
This answer did not please first of all because of the term "to be culturalized" and secondly not to explain concretely how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses put forward is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota hinted that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Gastronomy Challenge Oster, the public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage".
And this was noted in her first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and her two coronation day-ahead parades.
Although she seemed certain of herself at both parades, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for RCN's "Como en casa" program, said that the fact that Melina was named a princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the queen's crown."
Also, Valle avoided the press in the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social necessities of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his defects in his back and fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left him points on the last day".
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the journal Cromos considers that the mistake of the candidate of Valle were the surgical procedures she had undergone.
“The surgeries are good, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect.”
For this prize, which the National Beauty Competition presents for the first time, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel prediction arose that was fulfilled last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that today Melina begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass in history as one of the queens who despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Cali-based fingerprinter went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4 a fingerprinter from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprinters working in the local offices of the ITC, this week was the "availability" of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking adequate courses, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for her.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who ran the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galton magnifying glass, ink, a collector and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a typist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know about our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the corpses, fingerprinters support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove a part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to get a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the full-handed fingerprint and identify the offender who participated in different robberies,” he recalls.
Fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be suspect of the crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he is the murderer, it puts him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprinter explained that “fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents” are being extracted.
When they appear, a collector or strip is used to collect them.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the declining database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without papers," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything that is touched does not necessarily become a footprint.
It can be used, however, if the necessary confrontation is made.
The ‘indignant’ defies the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters rushed in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The Occupy Wall Street movement on Tuesday challenged New York authorities by trying to re-enter, through a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were rushing in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the “indignant” to camp again in that place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will move to another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the “indignant” response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignant' occupied a new park at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue power stations, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization says there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene in their behalf in front of the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned enclosure - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday, during which the legality of this morning's evacuation is to be analyzed.
A few displaced protesters were carrying and distributing copies of this court order at that time and even handing it over to officers monitoring the place, causing "certain small clashes," Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or from enforcing “laws published after the occupation began or from barring protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they used before.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to protesters, but he warned them that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the evacuation at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm other people," because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn was disgusting and demonstrates that Bloomberg is deeply more interested in defending financial interests than those of American workers," the movement's spokesman said, accusing the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they did not plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two-month protests, which began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson to be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement," rescuer on "Baywatch," rabbit on "Playboy," wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
Private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage from the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a crib a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears come Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV’s special Noel program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who himself is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian 'white' during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescing after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe in Japan since World War II.
Early estimates by the Government of Tokyo have estimated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have subsided.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, Gross Domestic Product data between July and September was used to turn the page definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annualized rate.
The one recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - assumes, in addition, the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that calls for the crisis to take advantage of to consolidate – or rebuild – infrastructure, to use shortfalls to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo recovered to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "safe haven values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the forecast turmoil of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, made the yen contribution responsible for their weak results between July and September.
While markets continue to be based in the EU’s peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not lower its guard.
"We need to monitor the persistent risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy, said yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries in September showed clearer signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator anticipating the tipping points of the global economy has highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
Because it dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone has even been below the average, which is in level 100, n decreasing eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens fuels doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to entangle itself in the labyrinth leading to the exit from the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic transitional government is rather imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there is no alternative to structural reforms 19 and that the 100-day period established in his nomination may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new demand for austerity in any way.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, reform of the civil servants disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear any doubts about his position: “We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else.”
The conservative leader has gone one step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the $8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letters of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the all-out Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika's inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "predominant" position in this type of finance
Spain "has reached a predominant place at the global level in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the V-e World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in one that aims to reduce the volume of people living with a dollar to half.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originated during the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for the women",
We have “achieved a lot of goals” and “we are facing a lot of challenges”.
The Microcredit Summit is envisaged not only as a forum for debate, but also as a platform from which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families will come out of the poverty line where they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the instrument’s father as an “admirable idealist in the universal cause of fighting poverty,” the work she has known about 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project gave him yesterday the term "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "bank of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging the people present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
“Ethical imperative”
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said microcredit is a "serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty," and now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the excluded people "to whom all close the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European president by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially foreseen on the programme but prevailed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those activists who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks too lax today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, were entitled, at the end of their speeches, did not leave room for doubt.
The Chancellor's master idea - and the motion - is based on a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen EU control over the budgetary policies of euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress clearly inspiring Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and CDU leaders believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone is laid.
Likewise, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the weight of each country on the European Central Bank's executive board according to the weight of each economy, which obviously meant reinforcing the weight of Germany.
Anxious to appease the climate within her party, the Chancellor multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she also did not seek to win her congress on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticize arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is Sick Stop Fraud?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15 to visit a family allowance fund, and to deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a willingness to make savings in a context of rigor, but is no less announcing an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
First of all for the purpose of budgetary savings: the government plans to impose on private employees a fourth day of deficiency before taking care of a work stoppage.
In short, without a specific business agreement, an employee who gets sick would lose four days of salary, that is, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that is likely to provoke anger, but would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: to impose on civil servants a day of leave without compensation in the event of a work stoppage (they have so far no leave period, compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also relaunches the theme of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The checks are going to be much larger and, in addition, if you are taken, you will pay back," Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday.
As in other cases, the advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
It has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, most of which have paid off.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let’s look at the national figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditures in 2008, at 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and occupational accidents, and 54% concerned sick leave, or € 6.2 billion.
That means 2.5% of health expenditures.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days of work stoppage, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides certain differences: another survey, published in 2007 by career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any sick days.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone to work stoppages than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France ranged between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud represents very little in the face of black work.
As for fraud, it reaches only a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has meant that checks are systematic on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term stops were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled breaks of more than 45 days, there were 11% of "inadequate or unjustified" cases out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, therefore, 169,000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who had had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little compared to, for example, that of black work.
According to UMP member Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to rectify its economy.
That's what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said Monday in front of Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the head of government said, delivering his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the “main task” of the new government, as the country’s participation in the euro area “is at stake,” he added.
Accordingly, Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects further austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday supported the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to further austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the goals of reducing the deficit and debt, and fighting waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to Royal Society of Canada report
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for this.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to be made by a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And despite most Canadians’ desire to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on incompetent or non-consensual persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, said in a teleconference yesterday, there would be more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," Downie said.
Canadians support euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would help end-of-life people ease their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are of less value.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing patient care, the situation is less clear, the report authors say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it should be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect a denial of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Finally, with respect to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee calls for it to be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already raised concerns about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Dr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts signing the report "extreme", inter alia because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 years of age could ask for help in suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
“In society,” he says, “there are beacons and constraints.”
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called “manifest pro-euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, specifically disputes the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordanian king calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a “conspiracy”
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the foreign ministry's premises yesterday.
Diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with Russia’s support, resists them and denounces a “conspiracy” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, took a stand in favour of a departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “quit power” in Syria where some forty civilians and members of the regime’s forces were still killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomatic chief Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that Turkish mediation efforts with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country against which Turkey is adopting an increasingly harsh line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a “strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking on an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces were killed in the southern Syrian region of Deraa, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSHR) said.
Two other civilians died "in exchange of fire and shelling at heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "going towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not bow,” he added, assuring that “the outdated plots against Syria will fail.”
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also supported sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by the regime, which he said is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities prey to the protest and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said yesterday that the decision of the Arab League was “incorrect” while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while avoiding supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.

Monti calls for time from markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future Italian head of government, Mario Monti, has called for some time from the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President-elect of the Council.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a narrow list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In “democracy, there are precise deadlines” for preparing a government and its agenda, he stressed, saying, “certain that the markets will be patient and understand.”
His appointment by the president had initially been hailed by the markets, but worries regained the top notably after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should form a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislature, he said.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said the new government will gain parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti pledged, once in office, to work urgently and with the aim of making Italy "again a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn said: “Even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change.”
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its fiscal balance target in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further stringent measures.
Italian boss Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth can not respect the deficit parameters".
Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents an "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism", the "teacher" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, because Italy is expected to place by April 2012 for 200 billion euros of state bonds.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risk said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) draws on the recent report from the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA last week expressed its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing largely from IAEA documents, Mr Danilenko, born in 1934, was reportedly working for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was reportedly involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system has been aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear program of his home country".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and offences against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence declined slightly or made little progress, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in crimes and anti-religious offences.
The total number of “hate crimes” rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by race differences and 20% by religion differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again," Human Rights First said, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be seen as a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, the group’s chief executive.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he added, saying it could lead to improved police reports on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter introduced changes Monday in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more similar to that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to more readily, live track the activity of other "Twitters", the users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This helps to know if they are following messages, if they are signing up for new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
Twitter's new formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to re-broadcast someone else’s message, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were discussing "tweets" decided on the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, invasive, and it’s too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 writes.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed," <0x40>dannykronstrom said.

Incorporation of a "golden rule" in the Constitution
The ruling Austrian Social Democrat/Christian Democrat government decided on Tuesday to include a "golden rule" in the constitution to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible deterioration by rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
It was the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were to be lowered by just one stroke, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros more interest each year,” said Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democrat Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus responding to a request from the Eurozone summit in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", with Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the federal government’s structural government deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to put the public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Yen fort
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historic levels that prompted Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record of strength since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has steadily risen since then, boosted by purchases from investors who see it as a “safe haven value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar rose below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues derived from abroad by Japanese firms when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern Tohoku region, Mr Noda said, fearing that this increase in yen will kill in the egg the fragile recovery.
The world’s third-largest economic powerhouse regained growth in the third quarter – 1.5 percent compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption from catastrophic households.
But the prime minister said the price of the yen did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", implying that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasuries by 5,000 billion yen (€47 billion) to 55,000 billion yen (€519 billion) the ceiling on the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Rates rise, Stock Exchanges flanking
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in fragile countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges are plunging a little more into negative territory on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt sells 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With new tensions on the yields of borrowings of euro area states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains.”
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, suffering in turn from renewed fears from market players over Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of fluctuations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalizes the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is evolving at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it has retreated after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, met at a congress on Monday, adopted a motion that includes the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has called for time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, as parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
Waiting for growth figures in the euro area
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE has revised down the figure for the second quarter, with a 0.1% decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it is really the fourth that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., as the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must outweigh the dogmas.
If there is one issue that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is indeed energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy that an election rendezvous is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that nuclear holds in them.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will result in a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless it deprives a huge part of the world’s population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity permanently, not to mention the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is neither the case with Belgium, which makes it necessary to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor with Switzerland, which just intends to build only the latest generation of power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are continuing their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to its park by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island crash.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, an energy dependence exacerbated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a surge in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
Within a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated on.
European champion of wind, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; by virtue of which, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a pledge for the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear would result in a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not manifest a principled opposition to this energy, polls show.
The energy policy of our country has helped build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it drives a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them very job-creating non-relocable.
If France decides to exit nuclear, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros of annual French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a skin of grief.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years when the decline of its manufacturer is scheduled?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miraculous electricity production, nor is there any diabolical one.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power plants as well as the Flamanville construction site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two unprecedented natural disasters that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the French and German safety authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR has a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift given to Areva and EDF competitors by leaving them the way to seize leadership in the inescapable development of nuclear.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate a debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the number policy, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it was the administrative harassment of foreign students that made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between left and right.
To the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising almost 2 million immigrant workers", and to the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be given to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande confines himself to trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally paying off; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries.
Restricting immigration anemia to growth and deteriorate employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants are likely to replace national workers, especially low-skilled workers, who are putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mostly engaged in jobs in sectors where there is a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the more skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow job supply.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to a 0.6-0.9% increase in long-term real wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the US Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenues minus expenditure) of €150,000 to public budgets on average over the whole of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the term, to go look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe Invented Democracy, European Democracy Remains to Think
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would suffice for democracy to definitively triumph over its enemies to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
It is known, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as much, first of all, a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the genuinely false Greek referendum in this respect will have had the value of a double revealer: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to necessity and in a dispersed order.
A white-seing to the absolute European monarch or a leap together in the void of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cutters, but a common, legal, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - there is nowhere else to stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
The whole of Europe is bowing to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the leadership of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because together, Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless of course it leads to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic government.
Oh, well.
But to think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new impasse.
We must take a new step in European integration.
In order to make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution in interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe, a genuine European sovereignty of the people.
To make Europe, let’s make Europeans.
"Contactless" smart cards become widespread
The global smart card show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most important segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or pay for your purchases by simply approaching a reader’s card.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double bites.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard cards this year.
To get to the next level, banks need to equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their customers in the future," said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Payments
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for transactions.
"They've been late."
"But they should finally see a real boom next year."
“We aim to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to next June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare for the launch of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is spreading
Paris is concerned about links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected, the links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's deputy foreign minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January reportedly uncovered the bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi's relatives, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their abductors during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of calls directed to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who spent a long time in Maiduguri, a northern Nigerian city, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we probably have to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its modes of operation, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or increasingly complex explosive devices and the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of unworthy illuminates.
A rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - meaning in Haussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for Sharia law while its activists engage in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily concerned with churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army is invading the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on the sect will radicalize and leave its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked the police headquarters in Abuja in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now a concern for all security experts.
While Aqmi has invested in Mali and Niger, and al-Chebab Somalians are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information.”
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, Iran, aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
By listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying the thunderous foreign policy statements and shortcuts, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsupported - are fused.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the nomination of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them "for manipulation of their currency", a theme carried in an America exasperated by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
No matter if it involves the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly choked himself in the face of an attitude that “flattens” emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who is stagnant in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran,” he boasted.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also pledged to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capability" - apparently ignorant of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the US military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in anti-terrorism matters.
They rightly insist on the failure of its naïve dialogue with Iran, on the overly hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq, on its distortions in Libya, thus sticking to it a label of weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers Obama’s national security record, which eliminated bin Laden, rather positive.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to stalemate.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The Nord Stream, new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe to Russia on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event brightly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part in the opening of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia with Germany under the sea, on Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and fine buffet.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have together turned the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe through a first 1,224 km tube connecting the region of St. Petersburg to the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second tube is to be completed at the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third one on the same path.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction site looks like a victory.
The project had been heavily contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any overland passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose a little bit of their power: it becomes harder for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to shut it off access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has triumphed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, gas-consuming and declining Western countries.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically,” Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon confirmed by inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how politically and economically large gas contracts are.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by the Gazprom leaders, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of steel sheathed concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“One hundred had to be abducted or destroyed, as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
Measures to protect the fauna and flora have also had to be multiplied.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing interrupts along its entire length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but project officials renounced it when the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state-owned company settle permanently off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who predicted the welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The state of the pipeline is monitored by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for outdoor observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced into the tube, wide of one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters seconds, it delivers precise information on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The flow of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
There are 200 bars at the start and 100 bars at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined.
These five companies created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom then leased the entire gas transmission capacity to the company for 20 renewable years.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided for 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach €7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to get back into their expenses, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that arrives, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every passing hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, of hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
Yet the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook design but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, takes care of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has restored to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces sold.
We are far from the confidential production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robot portrait of the buyer, because the notebook attracts both the businessman, the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its inception, now has almost 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
“We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendar, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a whole range of supports.
A success that made envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a voluntary public policy implemented in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Discouraging?
"No," said <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, managing director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
“The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable.”
At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher.
“There is still a lot to be done.”
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before entering employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it difficult to return to work, and that "constitute the node of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Managing Director of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's the objective brakes.
There remains the unspoken, the mentalities that are evolving, certainly, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entrepreneur for the City indicated that the managers interviewed had a "low level of knowledge of disability", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disabled ".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of... 1987.
The latest known figures, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, to 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What Happiness"
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45am) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match brings them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the platform of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after his attacker’s mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
“I’m very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he’s Belgian.”
"I want to move forward," says the Lillian.
As for the contrast between his performances in the club and in the selection, "it is a whole, if justified."
"In Lille, I'm there all year round, which is not the case with Belgium."
“I have to take my marks.”
Spared against Romania on Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brighten".
However, without omitting the notion of "pleasure".
Les Bleus, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supportive,” he says.
Inevitably, this contributes to further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
Especially since in front, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he rapelle.
"We met a while ago."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens for his part referred to "pride".
"Pride" of playing "a gala match."
"Pride" also to note - as a "neighbor" - that France has "returned a team of very high level" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a thunder job," he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would see himself share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are becoming big," he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll find out in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento’s Portugal begins with optimism his return dam against Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the time, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento already sees himself there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Sele<0xC3><0xA7>ao, of which he is in the controls since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to debug.
In view of the one-way game (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, but it was unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
“It’s a good result, but there’s a certain risk because we didn’t score a goal on the outside.”
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even if the party obviously claims to be "very tight", says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We are expecting a very tight match, but we are quite convinced that we will be able to take the lead," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
“We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” Carlos Queiroz’s successor said.
The draw reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
One zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but there’s a certain risk because we didn’t score a goal on the outside,” Bento said.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order not to " give them time to think."
It's a good idea, as long as you're realistic this time.
