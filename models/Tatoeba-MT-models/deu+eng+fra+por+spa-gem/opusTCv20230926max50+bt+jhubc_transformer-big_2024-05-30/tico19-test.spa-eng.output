Accumulated rapidly increasing incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their readiness for a wave of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a conglomerate of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China reported that the causative agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease that requires intensive care.
Mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those of the Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported in France on January 24, 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date inclusive, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), COVID-19 case counts reported in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with that of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 shortened to 14 days; in this way, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of March 15, 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day truncated COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries, in general, followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased considerably around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries exhibited similar upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA and UK countries had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is so despite different stages in countries, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different country case definitions and different protocols for selecting patients to undergo testing to confirm COVID-19, including delayed testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on COVID-19 admissions to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data are not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios related to health care capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK country of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk of >90% overcapacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
As case clusters have so far been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a defined regional recruitment population, case and intensive care bed information should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units, therefore, must prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as the one currently occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, given that the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response in a consistent manner if not implemented.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief opportunity period during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and lessen the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere around the world, generating a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and cause similar symptoms by a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicable and affects older people than younger people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on the emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will deal with the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions are still unanswered, we hope this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unheard-of and unforgettable memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home for the entire holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country and to nearly 50 more countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 patients deceased.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “no. 1 public enemy” and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific papers on COVID-19 have been published, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
The objective of this analysis is to summarize the advances in research on this new subject that is developing rapidly.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by VOC, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, a 2012 outbreak).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some decisive questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have encountered twice highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused an outbreak in China in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with horrific morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third coronavirus outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Fig. 1,1, conglomerates of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was disclosed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that transmission between humans was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and nearly 50 more countries around the world (fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final size and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 infected people were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expanded into clusters mostly in and around Hubei.
On average, 5 days (from 2 to 9) elapsed between the onset and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain a single-way chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses are the ones that infect humans.
The spike glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its cellular receptors, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusión occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA, along with the envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins, forms virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: Wuhan’s Huanan seafood market.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With a transmission electron microscope, particles of SARS-CoV-2 were found in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein S binds to human ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the electron cryomicroscopy structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution, in complex with the carrier amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study in order to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The Origin and the Intermediate Host
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the bat was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and it remains to elucidate the transmission pathway.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of bat virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within S protein.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins (long-nose mammals that feed on ants and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference propagated by the totality of two genomes remains a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected that provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20°C with a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a disinfectant with chlorine, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
To date, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Consequently, we can only resort to previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host vía pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including lectin type C receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I type receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response adds to the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
The cooperating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system locally generates a large amount of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multiorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the occurrence in conglomerates, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a lot of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases demonstrated that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, demonstrates that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the effective quarantine time to the most accurate incubation period; in this way, asymptomatic infected persons will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or by other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients and in line with the greater lethality of MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20%-25%), and sore throat (13%-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was needed in approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2,494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, SARS-CoV-2 R0 was reported to be high and rise to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The occurrence in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of traveling or residing in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients within two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that hospital discharged patients may re-enter the virus, a warning sign that the quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/l, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocytic sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Anomalies are detected in the chest X-rays of most COVID-19 patients, characterized by bilateral shadows or opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings in chest X-rays are usually parallel to the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocyte peeling, hyaline membrane formation and lymphocyte infiltration into the interstitium, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which is coincident with the pathology of a viral infection and RADS and similar MRS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at between 20<0xC3><0x97>10-18 mol/l and 200<0xC3><0x97>10-18 mol/l.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include currently in use or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use the plasma of recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as the digestive system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Consequently, respiratory assistance is critical to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECM) assistance, a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique that is used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storm is known to be the result of an exaggerated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3> and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release an enormous amount of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and multiorgan failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 receptor monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm are modulation of the T-cell-directed immune response; blockage of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a cytokine signaling pathway 4 suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, the prudent use of low to moderate dose corticosteroids has been recommended for a short period of time for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of this analysis, the efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in a U.S. patient with COVID-19 has been proven.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other viruses with single-stranded RNA, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and generation of antibodies
Blood extraction from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting the disease is not novel.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies to the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
On this basis, plasma was drawn from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved blood oxygen saturation.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this in order to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, possibly producing fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for treating critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or look for effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of the antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects largely depend on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to the theories of MCT.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimum combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been determined to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used MCT in 87 % of their patients, including Gansu (63.7 %), Ningxia (50 %) and Hunan (50 %), while Hubei province, which used MCT in only about 30 % of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13 %).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (MO) treatment only with combined MO and MCT treatment.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, symptoms disappearance and hospitalization were significantly shorter in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
More surprisingly, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of MCT remain awaiting further well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and determine the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are generally very afraid of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people with suspicion and people in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent, long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live attenuated viruses have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these possible vaccines in older people and lethal stimulation models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection must still be determined before a clinical trial is initiated.
This is probably due to SARS being extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been recorded since then.
Instead, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a prognostic model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 years and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 years of age in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably larger than those not requiring them (mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the evolution of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, an elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the patient's progression.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of cardiac or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for the prediction of clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high-dose corticosteroid use was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a brief period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as they generally endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower airways, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper airways and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, as with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stages or in the incubation period can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which greatly makes it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while transmission mostly did not occur at the early stage.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of nearly the entire population in hopes of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have been causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have ended by March and the downward phase will last 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exsudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a flu-like cyclic episode.
However, there have been promising signs in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been managed to control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectivity and eventually extincts or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is given below (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the stool, which poses a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases had possibly been caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even passers-by in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to decrease the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with respirator N95 (series number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent a potentially infected person’s liquid droplets from being airborne or sticking to surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860) can protect against inhalation from virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both measure around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear tailor-made insulation gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; it is possible that the virus has entered your body through your swollen eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear protective faces or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public of affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay home in voluntary quarantine, and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered an adequate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused great alert in China for its experience with the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was not until January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems preventing and containing the disease.
This message remarkably relieved the public’s alarm, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and missed the critical moment to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies should learn from this harsh lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public announcements, as each word matters to citizens and can cause them to change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more effective to contain a possible epidemic in its early stage, rather than attempting to reassure the public and to put more regular response to the epidemic system; and (4) more reactive to the public’s’s to simulate unusual information from clinics, rather than to wait for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more effective officials; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more effective; (3) more restricted;
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and some 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has generated a sense of SARS recurrence.
However, there are some notorious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older people than younger people.
SARS has higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually do so when they are seriously ill, which generates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, healed patients can test positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress made in COVID-19 research, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, including the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the responses to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to stop the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can resurface at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while being transmitted between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, extinct like SARS, or periodically resurface like the flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to look for answers to these and many other questions.
However, no matter what, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the coevolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild diseases, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put coronaviruses in the spotlight again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful for us to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses originate in bats, in which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for disease prevention in humans.
Investigating interactions between coronavirus and hosts in animals could also yield important information about the pathogenicity of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present an overview of existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Notably, we compared and contrasted the different coronaviruses in humans from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of envelope-positive single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which harbor the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were called "coronaviruses" because of their morphology, because of the corona shape they have under an electron microscope.
As for their structure, coronaviruses have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including pin (S), shell (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different coronavirus lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus of betacoronaviruses contains most human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the gene source of most alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have steadily crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronaviruses.
The other five betacoronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most devastating in today’s history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude lethality of around 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later dubbed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which the viruses are well-adapted and not pathogenic, but exhibit great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and restriction factors of cross-species jumping.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal hosts and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications in preventing spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, species-to-species transmission and human coronavirus pathogenesis.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that human coronavirus parental viruses are not normally pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after transmission between species to a new host.
We also examined the evolutionary trend of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility tends to lead to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analyzed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in lung WI-38 cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial pass in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed around the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a disease period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study in human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had a severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia,” caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from overpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of maximum viral load on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and shortness of breath as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function, and elevated creatine kinase levels are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages are also seen in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower airways, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, can also become infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of a relative of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to researching human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
HCoV-NL63 has been estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 isolated itself from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory disease.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown causes, such as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to have caused severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and be maintained continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases have been reported with occasional contagion to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MERS among diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were recorded, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid to late December 2019, conglomerates of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a raw lethality of 3.4 percent.
Notably, the lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while out of it it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which presents as fever, cough, and dyspnea.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between that of SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most commonly seen in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired human coronaviruses.
On the other hand, it remains to verify whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages between humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it still needs to be elucidated in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out if SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with community-acquired human coronaviruses.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread between humans, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community-acquired human coronaviruses that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Coronaviruses have been eliminated from humans that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that developed serious diseases by human coronaviruses.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired coronaviruses have circulated in human populations and caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to propagate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses.
It is highly transmissible like human coronaviruses acquired in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir animal or intermediate host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and human coronavirus amplifier hosts.
An animal acts as the evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it harbors a closely related ancestor who shares high nucleotide sequence homology.
The ancestral virus is normally well adapted and is not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts a human coronavirus on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, guests become naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parental virus.
In contrast, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or nearly at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and fulfill the amplifier host function by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then be transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data retrospectively revealed that the initial case of SARS had had contact with game animals.
Subsequent research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was supported indirectly by the fact that no more SARS cases were recorded after killing all the civets of the markets.
However, civets from wild masked palms or from farms without exposure to live animal markets were reported to be mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that civets from masked palms would only act as an amplifier intermediate host, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the chances that several species of small mammals will also act as intermediate SARS-CoV amplifier hosts cannot be ruled out.
All of them appear to be terminal SARS-CoV guests.
Subsequent searches of the SARS-CoV natural animal host revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive on anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat coronaviruses share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats harbor emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
The WIV1 obtained from a bat fecal sample was shown to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as a receptor to enter the cells.
Amazingly, será from convalescent SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, in general, it is believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental SARS-CoV virus and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV phylogenetically are closer to their bat betacoronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are HIV-positive in MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies specifically, as are camels from the Middle East in several African countries.
A living MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, further supporting that camels act as bona fide reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels for MERS-CoV investigations.
Notably, infected camels spread the viruses not only by airway, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of spread of bat viruses.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or to unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species that host MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RatTG13, isolated from rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the future virtually identical bat coronavirus.
Presumably, intermediate SARS-CoV-2 animal hosts should be among the wild species sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), could also harbor ancestral betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this novel pangolin coronavirus share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the RTG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In marked contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigus in lung samples, which are similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin betacoronaviruses.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related betacoronaviruses of SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2, and RTG13 share the highest whole genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
A counterproposal advocates a recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin betacoronaviruses and RatG13 in the third wildlife species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat coronavirus, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Mountain coronavirus) detected in a North American tricolor bat was reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the knowledge to date of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human-to-species coronavirus transmission events in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of cross-species transmission of HCoV-229E is not as accurately known.
Bat alphacoronaviruses have been found closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpaca alphacoronavirus.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the bat virus directly to humans.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alphacoronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas acquire the HCoV-229E-related alphacoronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it wouldn’t be too surprising for bats to transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronaviruses act as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, particularly in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by later findings.
It is evident that bats contribute, with a profuse collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, narrow social interaction and great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate host, to being a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolin betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host of SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses, as are civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities of transmission between species of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is needed.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Aside from the different types of animal hosts, three major factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronaviruses to cross species barriers.
First, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a read-check exorribonuclease, the removal of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to suppress coronavirus replication by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents ever tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of human adaptation.
It is hoped that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Second, the long RNA genome of coronaviruses exerts additional plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination and thus increases the likelihood of coevolution between species, which promotes the appearance of new coronaviruses when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and functions of the proteins encoded towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses change randomly and frequently templates during RNA replication by a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a host acting as a mixing vehicle, chain change occurs frequently during coronavirus RNA transcription.
Full-length RNAs and highly homologous subgenomics could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in coronaviruses of animals, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing transmission between species.
In the present, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in cross-species transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-CoV from humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, in particular with mutations in the RBD of protein S.
In general, the RBD of the S protein of a coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the antibody response of the host.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including the bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, as observed, only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human and civet viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of spike protein interaction with ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical to the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implies that the binding affinity of the S protein with human ACE2 could have been altered.
In fact, an electron cryomicroscopy study points to the 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding compared to that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-receptors may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different portion of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase in HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, following cross-species transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of cross-species transmission of human coronaviruses is also determined by other factors of host dependence and restriction.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to transmission between species.
Human coronaviruses must usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for interspecies transmission to be successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important área of virus-host interaction still have to be identified and characterized.
Objective full genome investigation of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could be beneficial.
New human coronavirus emerges: we start from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the gene pool of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-encoding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but were determined to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic elimination of 29 nucleotides of SARS-CoV was found in strains isolated at the onset of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lineages, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to undergo recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses recombine with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which most likely results in releasing viruses from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
Although intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alphacoronavirus has a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frame change.
Last but not least, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by selection pressure on their reservoir guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating the mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Apparently, bats are well adapted to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in activation of the proinflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells and the low level of expression of the class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats could suppress coronavirus replication and affect exorribonuclease reading check, providing the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate vigorously without eliciting a strong host immune response.
In this lie the secrets of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe cases of infection in humans.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the overactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from coronavirus replication.
The same immune response disconnection strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I, at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat betacoronavirus that shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been determined to host viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts have been identified.
Pangolin betacoronaviruses have been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin betacoronaviruses could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either deliberately or accidentally.
Coronaviruses have regained prominence due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in transmission in humans.
Vast evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same rationale, pangolins should be withdrawn from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several pangolin betacoronavirus lineages closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be elucidated in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks may appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is a great chance that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
Based on bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to spread presents itself.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, humans’ opportunities for contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if the population is educated to move away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin puzzle.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission in humans, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it must be elucidated how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, experimental surveillance and infection should be carried out.
Whether a bat, pangolin, or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 need to be updated.
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advisory guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and constitutes a good reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) triggered an outbreak, which is now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was dubbed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO called COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advisory guideline that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven issues and some contexts have changed significantly.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support your important work and express our appreciation.
However, her work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, it is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological history with two points of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations must be fulfilled if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residency in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms;
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in images of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts at the early onset stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some characteristic of pathogenic or serological testing as follows: (1) positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to recognized novel coronaviruses; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2; or
We can see that the polymerase chain reaction test in real time to detect nucleic acid in blood or airway samples was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions.
Detection of pathogens from blood samples was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then, serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
(NS)
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us that we must be cautious with asymptomatic and atypical symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system should also be verified in other studies and clinical practices.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to send us their feedback.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case", we recommend searching for and complying with the latest guidelines from your countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest in a day
Bangladesh confirmed five more COVID-19 deaths in one day.
It is the most deaths in a day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were staying in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, the director of the EIDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, whom they were attending at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh’s Minister of Highway and Bridge Transport, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be suspended for longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of essential goods, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on March 8, two men who returned from Italy and also the woman of one of them.
By March 19, these three had already recovered.
More than 1 million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said on Thursday it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 a.m. European Central Time (UTC-0800) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases were reported, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday from coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that the Russians would continue to receive their wages without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, curfews were only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until May 1.
Australian supermarkets lower toilet paper limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their toilet paper purchase limits to two and one package per transaction at every supermarket in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were posted as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reportedly fueling out of fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were introduced after the previous four packet per transaction restriction applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the enforcement of the four-packet restriction, “many supermarkets still deplete the product within an hour of delivery,” and said the lawsuit “was unprecedented,” while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was “unexpected.”
Sales rose with a "strong increase" last week, according to a spokesman for Woolworths.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for an anticipated Wednesday special offer.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but local city council restrictions on truck deliveries make it difficult.
It predicts an increase in production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, following the early release of stocks, some supermarkets are unable to make Wednesday’s special offer.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets stockpile stocks every night.
He stressed that toilet paper is a bulky item, which causes a low number of stocks, and when it is exhausted, leaves ample empty space on the shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea that if there were an abundant amount of the item on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could be [purchased] and there were large amounts, the panic would probably be minimized, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said inventories were depleted last Wednesday.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent, said they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the report on News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had free time on the long weekend of Worker’s Day.
Thursday’s issue of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Although the word “pandemic” only refers to the extent of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO stressed the need to push governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic “is unprecedented.”
In statements published by CNN in February, he said, “In addition to influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from onset to continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said “we’ve never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus before.”
“And we’ve never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time,” he added.
The new pandemic condition comes after the WHO’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, “in conclusion, it’s going to get worse.”
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international importance on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The case-by-case mortality rate was estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when you cough, keeping away from others, and controlling and self-isolating people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic upheaval, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus was disseminated on the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of eastern and southeastern Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant cases of viruses.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and in early January 2020 an investigation was initiated.
The cases, for the most part, were related to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan, therefore, the virus was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person who was known to manifest symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last mosted group on the market.
From the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two-thirds had a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report by the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to November 17, 2019, of a 55-year-old person from Hubei province, could have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as the new cases, reportedly, had declined in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases in China was the first.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's lead scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to get infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who underwent COVID-19 testing, and who obtained a confirmed positive result according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies of not testing people who had only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that an estimated 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected in China until January 23, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection in 79 per cent of cases recorded.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the numbers of infections in Italy were considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were from people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic, usually refer to the deceased people who tested positive on the COVID test, according to official protocols.
The number of actual deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who died without the test may not be included, for example, in their homes, nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of COVID deaths by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of deaths declared] is an underestimation," a statement corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the United States. This underestimation is common in pandemics, as in the first HN pandemic in January.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of evidence, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and general health. The proportion of deaths over cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global proportion of deaths per case is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths per case decreased from 17.3% (in those diagnosed with symptoms from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other indicators include the rate of death by case, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died from a disease, and the rate of death by non-infection, which reflects the percentage of death by infection.
These statistics do not have a specific timeframe and consider a specific population from infection to resolution of the case.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the death rate from pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimation of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on estimates of the case-by-case mortality rate.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said, “Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, generally stabilize and then begin to diminish when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But right now, it’s almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen.”
China’s top medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said it “could end in June” if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO’s recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 “will remain in circulation, possibly for a year or two.”
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary “until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, given that it is transmitted so easily, will disappear completely" and "could become a seasonal disease, recurring every year."
The virulence of the recurrence would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, production of sputum in the respiratory tract (phlegm), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, pressure or persistent chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and bluish color on the face or lips; when these symptoms appear, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, have no clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm the infection, so the researchers advised to carefully monitor and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44 per cent.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; most often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during close contact and through the small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to studies, when coughing without covering your mouth, droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by speaking. Breathing droplets can also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although the virus is usually not transmitted by air.
The droplets may enter the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and thus aerial spread.
It can also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through stool, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms manifest and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic case reports, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, usually one person infects two or three others. The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have touched infected people.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses related in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (line B) along with two bat-derived strains.
At the whole genome level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin viruses and those of humans.
To date, comparison of the entire genome indicated that pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share at most 92% of the genetic material, which is not enough to demonstrate that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by CT imaging.
According to a study in Wuhan that compared the polymerase chain reaction to CT scanning, CT scanning is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended “not to use CT scans as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually done with a nasopharyngeal swab, although a swab can also be used for the throat. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these proved to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features in X-ray and CT images of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral blurred glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by chain reaction of polymerase has limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study conducted in China compared the results of chest CT scans with those of polymerase chain reaction and showed that although imaging is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in images, both with X-rays and with CT scans.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without having washed them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures to prevent transmission are also recommended. Many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members do not know where or how they became infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for someone who might be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions, and use eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
Governments’ use of mobile phone location data for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are circulating; for example, nasal washing and mouthwash gurgling are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating and after snoring, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies upon contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not available.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them beforehand.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to the disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% iodized povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a facility, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs that sick people have used are disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or a disposable cough or sneeze tissue, and dispose of the tissue immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected wear surgical masks, as the use of a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by respiratory droplets that disperse when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO issued instructions on when and how to wear the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene."
The WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask to take public transport or be in crowded places.
Thailand’s health officials recommend people make fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned public spaces without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask while in public spaces in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government demanded the use of masks by all people entering a supermarket.
Israel demanded that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured 10 million face masks per day since mid-March, on April 1 demanded that passengers wear face masks on trains and intercity buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks to those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to curb the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
People can implement methods of social distancing by staying in their homes, limit travel, avoid crowded areas, use forms of greeting that do not include contact, and physically distance themselves from other people.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum meeting size recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations quickly dropped from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems have an increased risk of suffering serious illnesses and complications, and the CDC recommends that they stay in their homes as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak.
The use of the term "social distance" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in touch with others through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations to only have sex with a person you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to have been infected.
Health organizations have published detailed instructions on adequate self-isolation. Many governments have demanded or recommended self-quarantining of entire populations in affected areas.
The strictest instructions on self-quaranty were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to do self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies to control an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and has the purpose of identifying and isolating infected people, in addition to introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts move to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be adopted at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to decrease the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, mask wear and self-quarantine; community-based measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling mass-concurrence events; community commitment to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and surface cleaning.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection assessments and localized quarantines, and issued alerts about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who decided to quarantine and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but it should be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), as otherwise the transmission is quickly reactivated as measures are eased.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory assistance may be needed.
Using steroids can make the results worse.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also indicated that some “home and traditional remedies” can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key measure of response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19-positive patients, and increasing available intensive care capacities through staff training and increase.
There are several theories about where the first case could have originated (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a number of cases of unknown cause pneumonia were observed which was in charge of Dr. Zhang Jixian of Hubei Provincial Hospital.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus."
Police warned eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for setting the alarm.
Subsequently, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and reported to WHO.
At the beginning of January, enough cases of unknown-cause pneumonia had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, which contributed to the migration for the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub and a major railway crossing.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that, as of January 20, 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as orders to stay home, orders to take refuge in the place or confinement) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, complete some form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in the Philippines.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of confinement, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on November 17.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and her hospital reported to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
The first genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
While these notifications were being made, police warned doctors in Wuhan for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a “popular war,” to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a sanitary cordon banning travel in and out of Wuhan was announced on January 23, spreading to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, which included issuing health declarations for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions implemented several measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented in and out of Hubei.
Public transport was altered and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of restriction on outdoor exits. After the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, in mainland China only one case had been transmitted nationally in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveller who returned from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of nationally transmitted cases was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei as well as Wuhan, two months after the confinement was imposed. On March 26, 2020, China’s Foreign Ministry announced that entry of visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details as to when this policy will end.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged companies and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for firms. The Council of State declared a day of mourning that will begin with a three-minute moment of national silence on April 4 at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival.
On January 20, 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country’s health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9,336 church followers, 1261 or approximately 13% reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the maximum alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
South Korea presented what was considered the world’s broadest and best-organized programme for screening the virus in the population and isolating infected people, as well as identifying and quarantining those who were in contact with them.
Screening methods included compulsory self-reporting of symptoms by people newly arrived from other countries via a mobile app, drive-thru centers for virus screening with results available the next day, and increased diagnostic capability to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities. South Korean society was initially polarized about President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand Moon’s dismissal for what they considered a mismanagement of the outbreak by the government, or to praise his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases on a lower day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that, as of April 1, all newcomers from abroad will be required to remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea received requests for testing assistance for the virus from 121 different countries.
On February 19, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a center of spread of the virus after China.
Amid claims of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran by February 28, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian parliament closed, and on March 3, 23 of its 290 members reported positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is an increased risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of March 17, at least 12 Iranian ex-politicians or politicians in office had died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than are reported.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran could be affecting the country’s financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded relief from economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to escalate rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group of unrelated COVID-19 cases were subsequently detected, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak, which included quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “You will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities across the country while Italy was at 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics on the triage protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths from the pandemic.
On March 22, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoverys in Italy, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that Italy’s combination of a large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high lethality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not impose any kind of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement that he discouraged social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On March 23, the prime minister announced stricter social distancing measures, which banned meetings of more than two people and strictly restricted those necessary to travel and activities.
Unlike the previous measures, the police could demand compliance with these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersion of meetings.
Most companies were ordered to close, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in testing, hiding the true magnitude of the outbreak at the time.
Testing was tarnished by the defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of approval by the federal government of the non-governmental test kits (from academia, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test until the beginning of March (afterwards a medical order was required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

On the other hand, China's aid was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and contain the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided periodic updates to avoid panic over the Lunar New Year holidays."
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) World Health Organization (WHO’s) World Health Organization (WHO’s) invocation in 2009, the WHO’s representative Gauden Galea stated that while “it was definitely not a recommendation that the WHO has made,” it was “a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated” and said that “itation had no prece in the history of public health.”
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said ESPII was “due to the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without strong health systems.”
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that “there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement.”
On 5 February, the WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries “that do not have systems to detect people who contracted the virus, if any.”
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future". On 11 February, the WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros said that United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to contribute “the power of the entire United Nations system in the response.”
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which enabled the coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on the health response while the other agencies can contribute their expertise to address the wider social, economic and developmental consequences of the outbreak."
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was activated to provide a phase of international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in national management and assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at the national level and to make site visits in order to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and county level".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the global coronavirus threat would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a verification of reality for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and we must be prepared,” insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan also said the current data did not guarantee that public health officials would declare a global pandemic, noting that such a statement would mean that “we are basically accepting that all humans on the planet will be exposed to that virus.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said the WHO was "very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction".The WHO has received significant criticism for what is considered inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed that the rights of all people during the COVID-19 pandemic are respected.
The expert group indicated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that all people have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and is intended to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the Office of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his handling of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were fired because of their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political system’s response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe this measure was taken to protect Chinese Communist Party secretary general Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, dismissed an earlier recognition of the start of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The US administration has referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus,” claiming that “China’s censorship overpowered a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and “distraction from its administration’s failure to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government that described a communications ploy with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and cited the strategy as “Everything about China.”
“Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union’s foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that “there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, U.S. sanctions blocked Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The U.S. authorities were also accused of diverting aid aimed at other countries to their own country.
And disputes related to masks have been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “Only China responded bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous “high-level political source” that claimed 80% of Russia’s aid was “useless or underused for Italy.”
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the journalistic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment collect momentum, they will also be able to correspond if necessary.”
The planned NATO military exercise “Defender 2020” in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO’s largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a small scale.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it puts the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries involved, but also of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate in at risk."
On March 14, 2020, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, saying his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak boosted the demand for the U.S. to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, and family leave.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized about Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand Moon’s dismissal for either mismanagement by the government or to praise his response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed for several cases of supply shortages, as a result of the increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left the empty shelves of essentials, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, causing shortages of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning of delays in shipments of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand generated a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical items.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and the WHO warned that this would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas was affected by acute food shortages.
China’s and Italy’s measures against the accumulation and illicit trade in essentials have been successful, and prevented a sharp food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not had a considerable reduction, but prices could rise, according to representatives of the sector.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, including in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released the pork stockpiles to ensure adequate feeding of the population.
There are similar laws in Italy that require food producers to keep reserves for these emergencies.
Damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a March 16 news report, China’s economy was heavily affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 percent.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been seen as a threat of considerable destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist’s Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could outweigh those of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington at St. Louis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the world’s supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have been “turned up” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their most pronounced drops since 2008, the Dow dropped 1,191 points, the biggest drop in a day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
All three indices ended the week with drops of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH asserted China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again on the basis of fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places including travel attractions and the recommendation of governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry has reached an unprecedented level.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important travel season related to the Chinese New Year holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year’s festivals, while private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year’s events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass concentrations, including Beijing’s Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year’s holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80 % of GDP and 90 % of the country’s exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in hours of care or temporary closures.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50-60% drop.
This also led to a 33-43 percent drop in pedestrian traffic to malls in March compared to February.
Operators of malls around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in a situation of extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been left without that situation.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were stranded in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government help.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States in 2020 and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households lost some type of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented government-subsidized short-term work schemes, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German scheme for short-term labour compensation has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations and individuals, both employed and independent, around the world.
Culture and arts organizations sought to carry out their mission (often publicly funded) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions around the world had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rising consequence of the disease is the cancellation of major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian Penance season of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services via radio, live webcast or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter’s Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then the sanctuaries were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the sacred sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to start in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be “rescheduled for a date later than 2020 but not after the summer of 2021.” Casinos and other gambling venues around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to turn to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as those on Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live concert broadcasts or creating “festivals” on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous memes of the Internet about the coronavirus were spread, as many resort to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Eastern Chinese and Asian descent, and towards people from areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still limited to China) have documented racist sentiments in various groups around the world that expressed that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving what they considered fair retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiments.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on and off the Internet.
After the outbreak progressed to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first European country to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, could also be the subject of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to achieve a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, reportedly suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that’s why God took revenge on them.”
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "wrong". In China, they increased xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and intended for "waste".
Many paid-walled newspapers removed them for part or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published outbreak-related scientific articles available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, an accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests performed in different countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect reported case mortality rates, which are likely to be highly overestimated in some countries.
Through the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be done on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hisopaths or sputum samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours up to 2 days.
The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test performed with pharyngeal hisopates is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people who are tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by suction catheter, or the material that is expelled when coughing (sputum) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis for the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of January 23, 2020, the UK had also developed a test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the chain reaction of the clinical grade polymerase (PowerChek Coronavirus).

One in three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kits generated unfinished results due to defective reagents, and a jam in conducting tests at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of tests using two components was not determined until February 28, 2020, and only then were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced national availability of COVID-19 testing based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, as of March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationwide.
No quantity limits were announced; specimen collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance of Medical Care. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform an approximately 24-hour test period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received emergency use authorization from the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses the isothermal amplification technology of nucleic acids instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed, with the hope that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid influenza test.
As of March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that "thorax x-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computerized tomography] results can be obtained even before the onset of symptoms."
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar opacities in blown glass with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, cobble pattern and consolidation develops.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, where the polymerase chain reaction was compared to CT, CT is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended “not to use CT scans as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.” Since March 2020, the CDC has recommended polymerase chain reaction as an initial examination.
Part of the immune system reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and in population surveillance. Tests can be performed in central laboratories or by point-of-care tests.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratory tests, a single peripheral blood specimen is usually used, although serial specimens can be used to track the immune response.
For point-of-care tests, a single blood specimen is usually obtained by a puncture on the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is needed before analysis. On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capability is several hundred samples within hours and, therefore, is much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspected patients can stay in their homes, "emergency department gives the patient a tube for specimen", the patient spits on the tube, sends it and gets a result soon. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspected cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if they go to the hospital or the need to desect them.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient setting and that 10,700 people had been tested the week before.
Health insurance covers the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, tests using the drive-through system were offered in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, by the natural week of 12/2020, 2000 samples had been analyzed in at least 53295 samples by the sample samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples of the samples.
With the construction, which was supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian, and took 5 days, the model showed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to face the quarantine would have doubled without this capacity for testing.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow evaluating up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for liquid handling robots.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents affected massive tests in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols involving heating the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE was now doing more coronavirus detection tests per person in its population than any other country, and was geared towards increasing the level of testing for it.
This was achieved by combining drive-through capacity and the purchase of a population-level mass production laboratory of Group 42 and BGI (which was based on their “Huo-Yan” emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of polymerase chain reaction tests with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude to operate outside of China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for making kits that it shipped to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, delaying the tests available in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of the test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply sufficient testing kits on the recommendations and to meet the demands.
On the contrary, experts say South Korea’s high availability of evidence helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to reduce the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in private U.S. laboratories, and supplies of hisopates and chemical reagents were depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that incorrect results could be due to incorrect sample collection or incorrect use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would remove the kits that gave incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China that proved to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but, in early April 2020, announced that they were not serving.
Testing, complemented by the quarantine of those who had positive results and the identification of the people with whom they had contacted who had tested positive on SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the place where the first COVID-19 death occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests on the entire population of around 3,400 inhabitants, about ten days apart.
Approximately half of the people who obtained positive results had no symptoms, and all cases detected were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28 Singapore began recommending residents to stay in their homes, but schools reopened in time after the March 23 holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have performed the most tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who only have mild symptoms or who have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that are not testable and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to any of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as % of tests" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people who enter hospitals will have a higher number of positive as a percentage of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Constant hand washing with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted fecal-oral.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical times during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child’s tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap or water is not available, your hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before administering medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove from the hands pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people handling food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; decreasing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in handwashing practices can lead to small improvements in height growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced with the introduction of simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and is claimed the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that its frequent performance can cause skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition that causes itching and causes the skin to become flaky known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Hand washing too often is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (urinating, defecating), after cleaning a child’s tail (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultrymeat.
Other occasions where proper handwashing technique should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced handswashing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97%; the United States was close to half with 77%; and China had the lowest rate with 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing hands in the children's handswashing with soap.
The “Essential Health Care Program” implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a tailor-made action to promote children’s health and education.
Deworming twice a year, in addition to washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin improves by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution and increase the solubility.
Water alone is ineffective in cleaning the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of bacteria from the contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
Still, the CDC states that "liquid soap with dispensing controls that do not involve hand use is preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been intensely promoted to a health-conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence that using the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserves organisms resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant organism strains.
Thus, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as promoted.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, the sophisticated formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulators, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more conditioners for the skin (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
The pleasant warm water to wash your hands is not enough to remove the bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to remove natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and the first part of the 21st century, hand hygiene agents without water and with rubbing alcohol (also known as rubbing alcohol-based hand solution, antiseptic hand solution for rubbing hands or hand disinfectants) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Alcohol-based rubbing disinfectants remove bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based rubbing disinfectants containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to the 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and from 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria on hands 1 minute after application are more effective against bacteria.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are practically ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-based hand sanitizers should be used to rub, such as to moisten or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all the fingers, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing before hand disinfectants to rub, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid removal of microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper handwashing unless water or soap is available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can dry out the skin unless emollients or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of the alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or the additives present in alcohol-based hand rub solutions are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis was attractive compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free agents do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and the formula, and historically it has been much less than that of alcohol and alcohol-based rubbing solutions.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have been found to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ash or land.
Ashes or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, as it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because containers with standing water may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water apparently makes no difference.
Rub your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Shake for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer periods removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinse in a container can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let air dry.
Wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated again. The parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate handwashing when running water or soap is not available, for example, pouring water from a hanging can or pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are economic options to save water, such as "other home taps"
A home tap is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended pitcher of a rope and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a bar soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
More and more research indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the paper towel industry association European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by the most modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was detected that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, by 194% in the fingertips and by 254% in the palms.
Drying with the air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total amount of bacteria of 42% in the fingertips and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying their hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms. The scientists also tested to determine whether there was the possibility of cross-contamination of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microorganisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the bacterial count after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with disinfectant hand towels is an alternative during travel, when you don’t have water or soap.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing by doctors became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficacy (in 1846) for disease prevention in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff members to wash their hands when they are forgotten.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
Hand washing by doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed together by interlacing the fingers.
If there are debris under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from becoming contaminated by these surfaces again.
The purpose of handwashing in the healthcare environment is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, lack of handwashing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
A study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating standard hand washing and hand rubbing in the healthcare sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization’s hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website for the public to comment.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" for handwashing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before an aseptic work and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals in the soap (soaps "medicinal" or "antibacterial") confers the possibility of elimination to the handwashing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a brush to clean your hands.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow, generally for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, water from the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical gown is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic before and after treating sick people.
To control staph infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
Common soap washing results in more than three times the incidence of foodborne bacterial infections compared to antibacterial soap washing. By comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution with handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that alcohol rubbing reduced antibacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective at reducing oral influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium difficile hand spores than alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centers may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of hand sanitizers to the alcohol-based and record staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it challenging to achieve universal handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few faucets to wash hands near public or private toilets, although there are economic options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates can also be the result of rooted habits and not a lack of soap or water.
The promotion of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to a long-term behavioral change in the population.
For this to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economical steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to finally three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations may be part of the handwashing campaigns that are being carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that seeks to bring about a change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF pushed the creation of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of handwashing in developing countries in relation to avoided HVACs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting handwashing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and modern Florence Nightingale, the "founder of the sickness".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne diseases and health care-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with "correct handwashing techniques" were hung next to the washbasins in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing your hands” is a statement of not wanting to take care of something or sharing the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the biblical passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much broader phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse an imaginary stain, which represents her conscience of guilt over the crimes she had committed and had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value handwashing items more.
In addition, those people who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend handwashing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual handwashing in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevila and Netilat yadayim actions in Judaism. Certain washes in Christianity and Wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force you to wash your hands after you go to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam force us to wash our hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls in the workplace in the face of COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 refer to the application of hygiene and occupational safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and work task and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower risk of exposure have minimal work contact with the public and co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are advised, including handwashing, recommending workers to stay home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene rules, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the environment.
Works at average exposure risk include those where frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected by current community transmission or an international trip.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, highly concentrated work environments and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and personal protective equipment available in case there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care workers and funeral services, exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or handle samples of these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate for work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several workplace consequences.
Workers may miss work because they get sick, because they have to take care of others, or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are being demanded and the means of acquiring those goods (such as buying at non-peak hours, by means of home delivery services or by window from the car).
Finally, shipments of articles from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The goals of the outbreak response include reducing transmission between staff, protecting people who are at increased risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures being taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework for occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to employee behavior and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labor policies or procedures that require action from the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected according to the hazard to the worker, placed appropriately (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and systematically, checked frequently, maintained, replaced if necessary and disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly so as not to contaminate.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower risk of exposure have minimal work contact with the public and co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures that are recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, recommending workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene rules including covering when coughing and sneezing, providing paper tissues and waste containers, preparing for teleworking or working shifts, and using the necessary equipment and cleaning.
Immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a critical measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay in their homes until they stop having fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without having taken medication to relieve symptoms or decrease fever; that these sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay in their homes.
According to OSHA, jobs at average exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission at the time around the company’s location, or because the person recently made an international trip to a location with widespread transmission of VOCs.
These include the workers who are in contact with the general public, as in the schools, the workers who are in contact with the workers who are in contact with them, the workers who are in contact with them, the workers who are in contact with them, the workers who are in contact with them, the workers who are in contact with them, the workers who are in contact with them are in contact with them, the workers who are in contact with them and the workers who are in contact with them.
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to attend to the sick person, and offering a mask to the sick person, or asking him or her to cover his or her mouth and nose with paper tissues when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew must wear disposable surgical gloves to attend to a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or possibly contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Disposable gloves and other items must be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected at a later date. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruise ships and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include postponing the trip for illness, self-isolation and immediately informing the onboard medical center if anyone develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as canceling excursions, assemblies, and other mass meetings, such as physical or choir education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between desks, staggering entry and exit times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate health room location for children with flu symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, it may be considered to extend class cancellation. For police personnel carrying out routine daily activities, the CDC considers the immediate health risk to be low.
Police officers are advised to contact people with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 who follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers should clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning wipes before reuse and follow the standard operating procedure for containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and containment and laundry.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers fall into categories of high or very high risk of exposure.
Among the high risk of exposure jobs are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19.
These become very high exposure risk jobs if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19 or if they take or handle samples from these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
High exposure risk morgue jobs include those in which workers are involved in preparing the corpses of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected to have it at the time of death; these come to have a very high exposure risk if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for those risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be suitable in some health care settings and morgues.
Samples should be handled taking precautions of Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering separated into different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those people who work at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected of having SA-2.
In the United States, N95 respirators with NIOSH-approved or higher filter masks should be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes fit tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
The WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, provide care or transport them without performing aerosol generation procedures, the WHO recommends wearing surgical masks, glasses or facial protectors, gowns and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by an N95 respirator or FFP2.
Because the supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need to wear them, replacing them with telemedicine equipment, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the entry permit to a COVID-19 patient's room only to those involved in their direct care, using the same mask without removing it while the care of several patients with the same care.

[Covid-19] Lightening the burden and preparing for the future
SHIPPING DATE/Time: March 14, 2020, 00:24 h, coordinated universal time
LICENSE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we find ourselves in singular circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it poses are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that make up the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we’ve seen among all of our peers in emails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we’re lucky to work with are.
I couldn’t feel any greater appreciation and pride that all of you are my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Their work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites running, helping our peers get their pay, or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in this, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, shop or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
Although it should not be necessary to say it, we say it.
No need to ask for sick leave or paid time off; just inform your manager and help your team review schedules and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, let Bryan, of T&C Operations, know so that T&C can help with support and make sure management is aware of your situation.)
People who work on an hourly basis will receive full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and co-workers who work on an hourly basis.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are ill and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it’s about your personal care.
What we ask is to contact your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt properly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resource Operations, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate current goals and modify our approach to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don’t plan to “double the hours to catch up” when the pandemic ends.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care for loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning burdens and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will communicate the next steps to delegates and teams as soon as we have a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
State, Exposure and Cleaning of the Office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precaution, we hired an anti-viral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-use antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty of care protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members at DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our fellow New York Cityers already know, we’ve also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who already worked remotely from before know that this modality requires an adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings at intervals of up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over the course of several days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and submit the reading materials in advance.
Adopt video usage by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Appoint a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and speaker list, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the wellness reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remotes channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team is analyzing guidelines on webinar-based ergonomics to support the increase in work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This past week we have asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editathons, until WHO declares an end to the pandemic.
We informed you that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible for you to fulfill your share of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
This week we will follow up with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The overall sentiment of the global community seems to be, in part, sadness over disruption and, in part, relief over clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
From now on, CRT will be working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor impact and track our communications with them.
Maintain contact on COVID-19 issues
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 2:00 p.m., Coordinated Universal Time/07:00 p.m., Pacific Time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help in the way we can.
In the meantime, you can still find the information in this email message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are currently being heavily affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, any coverage issues, or anything you might need help with, feel free to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive matters, email Bryan Judan, Director of Global International Operations at HR.
None of these changes should be considered an abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are an acknowledgment that, at this time, our work and our obligations are likely to have to be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts in.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible, and that is why we need you to take care of yourself and your families so that you can find yourself in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of M2 peptidase and a renal C-terminal transporter domain of collectrin amino acids.
ECA2 is a type I unipass membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly adhered to the cell membrane of the alveolar type II cells of the lungs, to enterocytes of the small intestine, to arterial and venous endothelial cells, and to arterial smooth muscle cells of most organs.
Expression of ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of the ECA2 is to counteract the ECA.
ACE cleaves the angiotensin I hormone and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 cleaves the carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine amino acid of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Hi).
ECA2 may also cleave several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates membrane trafficking of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 protein spike S1 to the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help combat infection.
However, various professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing standard ACE and ABR inhibitory therapy.
A systematic meta-analysis review published on July 11, 2012 determined that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases."
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors and who had an increased risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not as solid for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (ARS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. rhECA2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute breathlessness syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help with contact tracking in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, that is, the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with a person infected.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for creating contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular in relation to systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be ceded to the government. In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app was launched to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking application was in an advanced stage of development and that it would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned to be used in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetry app for patients living in Moscow who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, designed to ensure they don’t leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple has limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to “official” or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
Surveillance should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
the extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have extinction clauses;
the use of the data should be limited to COVID-19-related objectives;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
Digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined by law;
protections against abuse should be implemented and the rights of citizens to respond to such abuse should be established;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) of Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercom (see the following section).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, which is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, have considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been published.
Privacy-protected contact tracking is a well-established concept, with a lot of published research going back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCNs, formerly known as contact event numbers, CENs), and other protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking (P protection).
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device and all pairing occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the white paper “Applications Out of Control: How to Maintain Personal Privacy During an Epidemic,” published in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly concurrent protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key aspect for broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they said would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
Implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent surveillance issues by first distributing the system through OS updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the re-adaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-directed RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ribophosphatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that they then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their backbone to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24, with the FDA authorizing the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an urgent use authorization (U.S.A.) on March 28.
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and is authorised under a U.S.A. only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when “there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, large studies are underway.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half was given umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would turn to the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant or trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticism has emerged about the allocation of resources to the re-adaptation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in more severe disease and transmission.
Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for people with a moderate disease and one for those with a more serious disease.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are ongoing for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial with Alvesco (ciclesonide) of Teijin, an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is ongoing and 200 serious patients will be enrolled in hospitals in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in decreasing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breastfeeding or non-affective contraceptive women are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On April 14, a multicenter study with 300 patients was announced in Italy that investigates the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying great attention to the re-adaptation of antiviral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SRAG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Here are some treatments that have been identified for possible re-adaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
(NS)
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus disease vaccine (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread across the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Targets of the main platforms that went to Phase I safety studies include the following:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 possible vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumably being planned or developed).
A Phase I or Phase II trial performs preliminary tests for safety and immunogenicity, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and multi-site, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and assess the vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing disease, while controlling adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 actively developing vaccines (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet under evaluation in humans (they continued in "preclinical" research).
Around Jan. 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential for a molecularly subjected vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan’s International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human testing to begin in 2021.
Projects for vaccine development were announced at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China on January 26, 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotech associate, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for vaccine development.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in treatment with neoantigenic cancer vaccines.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that the vaccine synthesis had been completed and that testing was beginning.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington at St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Detrick Fort and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, while moving fast, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine,” to which the German government complained.
On March 17, 2020, U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
The possible BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine is currently in preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical testing in April 2020 and that human testing of the possible final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a research alliance for a COVID-19 vaccine that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI’s total investment for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to $29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun animal testing of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced CAD 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, including a large number of potential vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, including the Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a “national vaccine bank” with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced testing for PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice and said that "SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines administered by MNA obtained potent responses from antigen-specific antibodies after the vaccination (in mice) was evident for two weeks.
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within human bacteria and produce virus-like harmless particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressing ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlights the need for Level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against RAGS and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against RAGS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat RAGS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. Nor does there exist a confirmed vaccine against RMS.
When SROM became widespread, it was believed that existing research on RAGS could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one SROM vaccine (DNA-based) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, with three more ongoing, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19-causing virus was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the SRAG coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiorgan insufficiency.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets occur when exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or on surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease.The standard method for diagnosis is the real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hisophagus.
Masks are recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that you do not use them, others recommend that you use them, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and bluish face or lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper airways, such as sneezing, nasal dripping, and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented chest oppression and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorgan insufficiency and death.
This is called an incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. Not all infected people are reported to have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people without symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Korea (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on April 1, with 130 of the 166 infections that day (78%) being asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking out loud releases more droplets than when speaking at a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth when coughing can cause droplets to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the corridor outside people’s bedrooms tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, airborne transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spreading through stool, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spreading is possible before symptoms begin, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that although it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, a person usually infects two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way. Soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and deactivate it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second test day.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses of a related nature.
Outside the human body, domestic soap kills the virus as it bursts its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cells through the angiotensin I type 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in the alveolar type II cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spice" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be related to receptor ACEs in the heart.
The receptor ACE2s have a high expression in the heart and participate in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in ICU patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a poor prognosis. In autopsies of people who died of COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes were detected in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by epithelial cells expressing respiratory tract ECA2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that pathogenic GM-CSF secretory T lymphocytes correlate with recruitment of IL-6 secretory monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
In autopsies, lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported.
The WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on airway samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal hisophagus; however, samples of nasal hisophagus or sputum may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken two weeks apart and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether the person was infected in the past) were developing, but were not widely used.
Experience in China with testing has shown that accuracy is only 60-70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020, for use by the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University’s Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular frosted glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, disordered cobble pattern (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
Few data on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19 are available.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and giant cell formation with multiple nuclei
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in cure: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying in the house, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and, if you don’t have tissues, use the inner part of your elbow.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth covers in public places, one of the reasons is to limit transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies seek to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling crowded public meetings.
Distancing guidelines also indicate that people should maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Since there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, at the earliest, a key part to controlling COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, what is known as "flattening the curve".
CDC also recommend washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when your hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after nosing, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available in a timely manner. For areas where hand sanitizers are not easy to obtain, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for antisepsis of the hands."
The glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are given supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy, and treatment for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they have the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EMOC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments can be useful for those who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensives and pulmonologists in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend quetatamol (acetaminophen), rather than ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when procedures are performed that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 place the patient in an airborne infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and precautions to avoid airborne transmission. The CDC highlights guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is EPP gown, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, respirators (rather than masks) are preferred.
N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized their use through an urgent use authorization (U.S.A.).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but do not guarantee effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective facets or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for hospitalized people with COVIDA-19-related respiratory failure and there is already some evidence that intubation can be prevented with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure in the airways.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provides the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases occur mainly in older adults (over 60 years old and, in particular, over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, limiting the ability of the health system to manage the sudden increase in severe cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5 percent were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3 percent needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4 percent died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a COVID-19 patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different modes of pressure control and PPTP are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPP.
Research into possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, several drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medications can be tested on people with the severe disease.
The WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.The FDA granted a temporary authorization to reconvalescence plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person’s life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect "narrow contact" and thus a potential risk of infection by means of surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-confinement, but also alerts local health officials. Big data analysis of cell phone information, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they were in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared summary phone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breaches.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Galleria said mobile operators have informed him that "anyway, 40% of people continue to move."
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a worldwide request for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel distressed about quarantine, travel restrictions, and side effects of treatment or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “Growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may follow a mild course with few or no symptoms, so it will resemble other upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases can take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of getting a serious infection with the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SRAG virus and SROM, but data on COVID-19 are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severe cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to water difficulty syndrome (RAS) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiorgan failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, impaired coagulation, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Impaired coagulation, specifically increased protombin time, has been reported in 6% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19; while impaired renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the mean time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In an incipient case study, the mean time from first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among males was 2.8% and among females was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage resulted from elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Insufficient counting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die than nonsmokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20-30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ damage.
This can also cause post intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity appears to be possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been reported that subsequently tested positive for coronaviruses.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a re-infection.
This virus is considered to be natural and animal-derived, by means of an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to transmission between humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as of December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of the symptoms was December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the CIE-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The determined mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the rate of death in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and the rate of death in infected people, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to resolution of cases.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these can provide information about how many people became infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the youngest, so there was relatively low mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health care system has not been overtaken.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is highest among males in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is narrowed only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in men and 1.7 in women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are not known, but it may be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological differences based on sex, the lower number of women who smoke, and the fact that men have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track information about sex in COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and RAGS, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nurses, are women and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the disease’s official name would be “COVID-19.”
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to corona, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations for preventing stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses “the COVID-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19” in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a respirator and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local startup reverse engineered and printed the necessary 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged that spread rapidly over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no medicines or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY Trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The above work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the receptor ECA2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are looking to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus get into the receptor ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines for any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Readapted antiviral drugs make up most of China’s research, including nine phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries and due to report by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and potential COVID-19 drugs was underway. Several antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence on the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for the investigation.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an urgent use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial priming of S protein performing transmembrane serine protease type 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with receptor ECA2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines.The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in treatment regimens after completion of a small study.
It is found in a non-randomized national phase II test in Italy after seeing positive results in people with the severe disease.
In combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, it is expected to counteract these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death for some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
To date, there is no non-randomised controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those recovered from COVID-19 to people in need of them as a method of passive immunization without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with SRAG with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive treatment with antibodies can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve faster distribution.
