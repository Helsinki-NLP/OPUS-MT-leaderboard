Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament) sparks dismay.
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of all political directions fear that they will become the target of mockery.
A member of the National Assembly of the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the name rhymes with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.
For non-Walisian readers: In Welsh, “twp” stands for “doof” and “pwp” for “Aa”.
A member of the National Assembly of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the entire group was “not happy” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law for the name changes, said: "The final decision on designations for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals, which gave broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of National Assembly Members, the Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs preferred, while the MWP option was the most supported in a public hearing.
Members of the National Assembly seem to be proposing alternative options, but struggling to reach a consensus could be a problem for chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce a bill within weeks.
The Reforms Act will include further amendments to the workings of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of National Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set up to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province with the similar name Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means this claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past,” Adams said.
“There are no longer both.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People’s social lives today are different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves.”
With the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the church leaders assume, and that they “will stand at the beginning again sooner or later.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums in which people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or support blacks.
During a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's community members planned to rebuild, they commissioned the bell toy.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly described the bell game as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who rang the bell toll in July used other words: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin’s in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been drawn in part by the lay leaders of the Church and partly by the Bishop’s Diocese.
In July, the municipality’s board of directors, consisting of lay leaders, expressed written concerns about the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the municipality’s board of directors, even though the latter had not been involved in the commissioning of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some community members complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old shark injured in lobster diving in California
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cry for help and paddled to the boy with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, “I’ve been bitten!
I was bitten!”
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire keybone was torn open.
“I shouted everyone should come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks before, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
For investigation purposes and for security reasons, officials blocked beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but they are mostly not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans advancement in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's attacks boats, superdrugs and Debenhams with department store-looking cosmetics departments filled with specialized assistants.
As part of a large-scale advancement in the UK’s 2.8 billion pound cosmetics market, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments will be tested at eleven national stores, and if successful, they will be expanded to further stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for ways to use store spaces previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods elsewhere.
According to Sainsbury’s, the scope of its cosmetics offering is doubling for the first time on up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
In addition, the supermarket is relaunching its “boutique” makeup series, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer will test Fragrance Shop in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first store opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second store will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food at local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain with more services and non-food items tries to fight off discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Since the acquisition of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury’s has established hundreds of Argos stores and a number of Habitat stores, increasing food sales and profitability.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drug dealer's branches in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our range of brands is tailored to suit all needs, and due to the tempting environment and the convenient locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases that challenges the way you shop so far."
Peter Jones ‘Angry’ After Holly Willoughby’s Withdrawal From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Business
“Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones is “angry” after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The “This Morning” host, 37, announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new follow-up contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was said to have been "angry" when the television's "golden girl" at a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted to not being able to devote enough time to the joint homewear and accessory brand Truly because of their new businesses - worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and would likely have doubled Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure their future for them in the long term over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to all parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe the withdrawal of the “This Morning” moderator, one of the UK’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and potential further delays in market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holidays together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV show “I’m A Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night, “We are not commenting on his business affairs.”
Hard words “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment some would consider “not presidential” and for such positive remarks about North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mimicking the voice of a news moderator:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
However, denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told leaders from around the world at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees no “corresponding” response from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. was sticking to sanctions that should maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of the missile tests, support in the release of hostages and return of the mortal remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowds right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of Lombok were displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international support, so that’s a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the Civil Protection Agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu on whether international bodies should participate in the relief measures.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country remains unfortunately ill-prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters have been erected in Aceh, these are not an everyday sight on other coastal strips.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite a warning that came into effect, has likely contributed to the deaths.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is already a challenge in the best case scenario.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made upgrading Indonesia’s struggling infrastructure the core of his election campaign and spent abundant money on roads and railroads.
However, the government of the next year’s re-election-seeker Joko suffers from funding shortfalls.
In addition, Joko is under pressure due to continued religious tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a deep strike against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute ahead of a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at a 0:1 draw of his team, about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal.
He pointed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sailed high above the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to put myself in this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time for myself as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and had contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led by Belgian star Eden Hazard to the half with 1:0 after a 25-minute hit.
The Blues striker gave Mateo a pass with his heel, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in the midfield.
He then fired a good steep pass, so that Hazard entered the penalty room.
Hazard left the defenders behind and ended in the net with a left-hand shot on Liverpool's Alisson Becker past the rear.
Liverpool play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will play in the UEFA Europa League Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Civil Protection Agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that had been brought down by Friday’s 7.5 earthquake, which had triggered waves up to six meters high, official spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbed woman
After a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found in Grayson Mews, John Street, at 7:55 a.m., and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something with a dashcam to contact us, and they may have information that is of utmost importance to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was living in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to inquire where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway, and police said they are about to inform the victim’s next relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that now the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared dissolved in tears at the scene.
She repeatedly said, “That’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vehicles inside the gate and another vehicle in front of the gate.
Inside the fence were several police officers who monitored the apartment block.
Individuals with information are asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call number 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and refer to the September 30, 247 log entry.
The Cromwell Statue in front of Parliament becomes the latest monument in the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on removing statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell became the target in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The Image Storm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th-century opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today, as someone who defended parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, through the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of continued history debates.
Sure, the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of this gap.
His achievements as a lord protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.”
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, to whom only the surname “Yuan” was named, was found dead with a blood-spoiled artery near a pig stable at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, prepared to inject pig vaccines.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pighouse was open.
He said there was a big male pig with blood on his nose in the stable.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighing 250 kilograms had bitten the farmers dead.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” the cousin to whom the surname was named “Wu” was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Footage from a security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged neither to Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been imprisoned to prevent attacks on more people, while police at the scene collected evidence.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, suffering serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 kilogram pig trapped a Welsh farmer between it and a tractor until the farmer's wife could scare the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
They like to pry and are very curious ... they aren’t meant to hurt someone.
You just have to treat them with the right level of respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa Bring Widespread Heavy Rain to Southwestern USA
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening on its way over the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. east coastal time, Rosa recorded wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form over the Pacific, moving eastwards to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will trigger up to 25 centimetres of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical humidity generates widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days through interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall can cause dangerous flood-like floods, water-driving rubble, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity sometimes leads to precipitation rates of nearly 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the scattering of tropical rainfall, there is a possibility of flood-like floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Given the threat of tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to become tearing currents, and thunderstorms bring local wind gusts and winds carrying dust.
The approaching trough brings locally heavy rainfall to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation amounts of more than one centimeter are possible, which can lead to debris drifting in the water and smooth roads in a small amount.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and it rains widely on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is spreading into the Four Corners region on Tuesday and lasts for Wednesday.
In October, there are strong temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12oC.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat is trying to re-evolve and expand.
For much of the central and eastern U.S., a warm start of October with widespread temperatures around 27oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast is expected.
New York City could reach 27oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million viewers saw the captivating statements of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and woman Christine Blasey Ford accusing him of sexual assault in the 1980s on six television networks on Thursday.
In the meantime, the political stalemate halted, with television stations interrupting their regular program on Friday because of a last-minute twist: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% certain that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, pushed her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million spectators reported by Nielsen watched the hearing.
The company determined the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring spectator numbers in offices.
To put this in the right perspective: this corresponds approximately to the number of spectators at a play-off football match or at the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, reported the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers at the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million spectators.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained strong after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS as protesters in the elevator loudly pressed him with words on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood for minutes with a lowered gaze while being scolded, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“They have power while so many women are powerless,” one woman said.
Flake said his office had released a statement and supplemented before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee was to vote on the forwarding of Kavanaugh’s nomination for voting to the entire Senate.
Flake, however, said he would do so only on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flake is partly convinced by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that without the investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations made against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in an interview with the Sunday Times of using Britain’s future for political purposes and undermining the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In an interview published alongside the interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called “Chequers plan” for Brexit, calling a proposal that Britain and the EU would force tariffs on each other “completely absurd.”
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shootings of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned for murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
The agency released video footage of the clash between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
According to CBS partner station WAFB, police secured the spectacles at the scene and said that DNA had been found on Simpson's spectacles.
After an interrogation of Simpsons, police said he had confessed to the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the bail has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the throat.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal police’s criminal technical laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local residents for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement agency for “their care and their pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for LSU basketball.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “deeply shaken” and “under shock” over Wayde’s death.
“You’re always afraid of something like that,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 ejections of gas and ash were registered within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of bursts and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists found that since September 2017, an earthquake of the magnitude 7.1 had shaken central Mexico, there was increased activity on the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
The Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the standby police and pro-independence protesters, and thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the standby police, sprayed them with eggs and also dumped color powder, resulting in dark dust clouds on the normally tourist-populated roads.
In the course of the day, there were also handshakes with the police, who used their sticks to contain the fights.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “No Forget, No Forgiveness” while facing unionists who shouted “Long live Spain”.
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered in the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen by Madrid as illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
Voters had opted for independence with an overwhelming majority, despite low voter turnout, as opponents of split largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes outside the polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had campaigned outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, said he no longer sees the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite an important, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, many of their best-known leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in custody, waiting for their proceedings because of their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of police on his phone, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for next year’s election to the European Parliament.
“As a candidate for the European elections, the best way is to denounce the degradation of democratic values and oppression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After House Was Framed By Car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, it may have been shot at the car with an armpit.
Menga hit means 1-0 win over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to be crucial for Gary Holt's team to match Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team stays in the Premiership this season without a away win and will face the Hearts, who are eight points behind.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston can increase his division winning series to six games in the meantime, meaning head coach Holt hasn’t lost since taking over from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against frankly playing guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the match, as his directness presented the Rangers with a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the goal. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after being slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's headshot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive goal was achieved.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a chance for Declan Gallagher and Robinson to jointly fire Menga, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball, but were unable to overcome the hosts' defenses, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unharmed.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was knocked off by Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor, and Lithgow pulled the ball from another standard Livingston situation.
Flanks repeatedly entered the Livingston penal zone and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required penalties – one by Halkett against the alternate Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were denied.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and exceeded expectations in this upward trend again.
Her playing style and her team have hardly changed since returning to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has shaken the team since arriving.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on track throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not achieve this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the hosts’ team – and that’s kind of like a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), smiling faces and blue skies reigned as the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was to be used to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then travelled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for preventing a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and blasphemed by others as an autocrat.
Deptford traffic accident: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has been killed in a crash with a car in London.
The collision occurred at around 10:15 British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics took care of the man, who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist was killed in a driver’s escape accident on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from Saturday’s accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his closest relatives.
Road blockages and diversions for buses have been set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officers injured in riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a high-security men's prison.
The riots broke out Sunday at around 9:30 British summer time at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still halting.
Specialized "Tornado" officers were recruited to end the riots involving eight inmates limited to one wing.
The officers were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to clarify that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will potentially spend longer time behind bars.”
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, police officers were summoned to jail to deal with serious riots where staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas may benefit)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert-shaped southwest and carry the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada as well as southeastern California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come close as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall with occasional rainfall of up to 15 centimeters in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
In other areas of the desert-shaped southwest, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and occasionally up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with pink can be a blessing due to drought in the region.
Although flooding is of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as drought is currently prevailing in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder waters and thus weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to hit land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, rainfall is expected to range from 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible,” weather.com reported.
Afterwards, Rosa will move as a tropical storm in a northerly direction over Mexico, reach the border with Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move upwards into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening through Arizona.
"As the main danger associated with Rosa or its remnants, very heavy rainfall is expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-shaped southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center reported.
As a result of this rainfall, life-threatening floods and debris in the desert and in mountainous areas are expected to slide.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with a puncture wound in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 British summer time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked everyone who has records of what happened on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered “under the meanness, the anger” of the Democrats.
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard-of tactics of the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered “under the malice, the anger” of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, rejecting the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also testified at the hearing to her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote for the endorsement of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the endorsement of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding track record in service to the general public,” he told the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he talked about the importance of Republican voter participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t show up, but in reality I show up,” he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission as “to resist and block.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquakes, death tolls rise
According to authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swept away when gigantic waves hit the beaches due to a severe earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, tearing many people to death and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the threat from the tsunami arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run away and fell victim to it,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian civil protection agency BNPB, at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it was floating cars, logs and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had pulled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Some people on the run from the tsunami have climbed trees and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Civil Protection Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that energy released in Friday’s massive earthquake corresponded to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown larger, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a Red Cross statement, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency was often criticized for failing to inform that a tsunami hit Palu, despite the waves arriving at the time of the warning, officials said.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building, desperately shouting to warn people on the street beneath him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall bursts onto the shore and floats buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a massive power outage that disrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue measures.
According to authorities, the military has begun to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees are still in urgent need of food and other vital goods.
The city’s airport is closed until October and has only been reopened for relief.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, where the staff are housed in tented accommodations in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Doseba, they passed scenes of devastation on the way.
“They said they saw numerous destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even as the relief groups began with the tough task of starting disaster relief, some moned that skilled foreign helpers would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the location of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened until now.
“At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and tsunami on Friday was lowering over Palu, friends and family members of the missing were hoping for one of the miracles that lighten the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was trapped under debris next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asia games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were prisoners at the Roa-Roa hotel, Mandagi added, were his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders made the round, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, led to only grey question marks instead of blue check marks.
“I think that means the news wasn’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during refilling ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release by Newport police, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s employee in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning while refilling an ATM.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to repay more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man ran after Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money that was destined for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Individuals who have information on the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears on the show as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has cancelled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it has, in its own statement, a religious meaning for the West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said this year in a conversation about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, just became ‘yes’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West worked earlier, has already written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of the bloody reprisals against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at which time left-wing student movements were in the process of establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans through monthly student grants and the opening of further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities led young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Financing for Artificial Intelligence
Given China’s intensified activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research in this field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the US government, even though the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, last year China presented its plan: the country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major AI success would be achieved in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Othello player, later serving as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised earlier U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge and asked about the timing of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lees, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state subsidies.
“It is not China that takes away the top academics, but the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired coryphs from universities to work on AI.
According to Lee, a changed U.S. immigration policy could also be conducive to U.S. AI efforts.
“I think that in the field of AI, people who have a doctorate should be offered green cards automatically,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s Council of State presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lee’s words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donating funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve partners from industry and science, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the $2 billion investment in the “AI Next” initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, nothing has happened to U.S. laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia" that would settle a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim raises the Greek territory, so Greece has vetoed Macedonia’s inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign doubts that the voter turnout will reach the 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, inclusion in organisations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they would stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
Voter turnout, however, was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
“I’m here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will vote in the referendum on the change of the country’s name, which would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union, on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a raised head, not through the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in much-needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I think a large majority will be for it, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
In his words, a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first severe blow to the pro-Western government’s policies since its takeover in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Brighton defense to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his score in the 65th minute look ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender, then overtaking several other defenders at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame with his right shoe Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We had talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the moment.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this move far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to drive Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker targeted the ball in the net just before slipping out.
City will play in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 am in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Joker Wants to Destroy the Rockies
Since the nationals have retired from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
The ever-performing joker, however, hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies, who have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere of the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level I would meet this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let jokes throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington right-hander this season has a statistic of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation in connection with the Brett Kavanaugh he selected for the Supreme Court, when talking about the importance of Republican voter participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not running, but in reality I’m running, that’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by all means, you see the meanness, the abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overtake to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, he said, see their mission in “conducting resistance and blocking.”
“And you see this in the last four days,” he said, describing the Democrats as “angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest.”
He named, by name, the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked loud buzzing in the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document go outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I’m waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour no longer accepts all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who say their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MEPs to be told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she had vigorously opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the reprimand for having a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that “the meetings should all involve and be productive.”
Most of the Friday night GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not influenced by this tone, and the promised "kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
It is becoming increasingly clear that deviating views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is judged by whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader. Colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views, now expected me to make a turnaround and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – be it about national security or the European single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – regardless of what I say – a social media outcry follows, calling for my election, denouncing the political center and saying that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
With this experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues, as the comments addressed to me are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis and yet never admit to being small.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every proposal of mistrust and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to shrink my head and not express my opinion so clearly, then I would have "no problems".
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government, where my classroom literally fell apart in the entire school, I have fought for better public services to those who need it most – as a councillor as well as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a secret of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be unclear in any way about my political positions and about areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of Friday’s motion, I would just like to say this: Given the fact that the country is racing towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
In fact, I am sending this one message not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many voting threats or political thinking will not stop me from acting in the best interest of all of you, in my opinion.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result a bit, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this extremely entertaining game of the day in Tennent’s Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams to be unbeaten at the top of the table.
Ultimately, the home team’s success was due to their superior defense as well as their better chance utilization, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Recognition for Ayr, they’ve leveraged their chances better than we do.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, led Ayr, but Melrose was able to make the numbers speak due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot caught a non-increased attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before scoring a direct half-time hit and then scoring an increased attempt on his own, making it 17:5 for Ayr at the break.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
After a severe injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was worn by the field, Ayr expanded his lead through a Climo-increased attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then Blair Macpherson, acting as Captain of Ayr, received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a period of enormous pressure, Melrose had the additional man paid by a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the advancing Ayr package from the kick-off street.
Climo increased as almost since the break, after Kyle Rowe had intercepted David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flank player Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth attempt.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a move into the hospitality industry after it turned out he was named the managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant business."
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, enclosed by land, hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in front of the tauwerk-decorated naval headquarters in La Paz.
On public buildings, a sea blue flag is waving.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our rightful property.
To win it back is a duty.”
Everywhere in Bolivia, trapped by land, the memory of the coastal section lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is as alive as the desire to cross the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a judgment by the International Court of Justice to be delivered on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and expects the result, of course, with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Across the country, many Bolivians will be prosecuting the ICC’s ruling on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim. According to this, after decades of sporadic talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who will face a controversial fight for his re-election next year, is also at stake in Monday’s ruling.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that it would change little.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorized to allocate Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
In the opinion of Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, the ICC’s ruling was already six months after the final plea, suggests that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the past four years could also mean a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has taken up the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
She suggested that Morales's warlike rhetoric had stifled any remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events, this will become extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision had fallen unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia "has an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and a "chance to put an end to the 139-year-long disputes for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is a chance to recognize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of rivals in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo more than three months after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore seems to be on the verge of restarting stalled nuclear diplomacy.
Ri described the notion that further sanctions and US resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever force the North on its knees as a “brain ghost.”
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang first taking substantial disarmament steps.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about the renunciation of an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris showcase the latest collections for huge headwear, which will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer have to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized headwear for their 2019 summer collection on the catwalk, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their eye-catching creations across the catwalk.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide rim that almost crushed the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories were jewel-filled watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were provided with sewn-on lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to haute couture.
One creation resembled a diving gear, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a molten ice pack.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly to "La Bomba", the 60-centimeter-wide straw hat that everyone wears from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that hit big waves on social media sent another great creation over the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model wearing a swimsuit that held the bag.
The bag in reddish orange with bast franje and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has aroused so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding examination results and is only supported by individual and joint achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community-based enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to care for their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s exam results show that languages with the highest incidence rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages scored A on the higher exams.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin scored A on the higher exams, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also scored A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as electives as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, engineering, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17% of employers’ reasons for the problems with filling vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open positions require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the profession chosen, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Communicating directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
That’s why it’s important for today’s children that we now invest in language education.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests are, independent schools will always have a number of languages to choose from with appropriately specialized teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future looks like.
At this time, in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, which is why this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron ahead of Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James compete for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait will soon end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the pre-season.
However, how many minutes he will play is not yet clear.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play just a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked to train for his plans for the Lakers’ six-game pre-season schedule.
"I don't need any pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare myself," he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of campaign rallies.
This is the first of Trump’s five rallies planned for next week, including in well-meaning places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the floating vote on confirming his election to the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress.
When will Trump’s rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearings on allegations of sexual misconduct that have been conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains on the run for up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main goal of this rally series is to support Republicans facing a difficult November election.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies will serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is as important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible while the busy campaign season is approaching,” a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to name his name told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could participate in the rally planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and report on the media from Pittsburgh.
The visit on Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been in polls in the past.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to boost him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US Team Shows Combat Readiness to Maintain Hope for Individuals on Sunday
After three one-sided laps, Saturday afternoon’s four-way matches may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum as a sports concept is a pure invention, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like these.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now there are four, so I think that’s a little momentum for us,” Spieth said as he left the venue.
Europe is, of course, in the advantage and is at the forefront of four points, while twelve more follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each have three of four points.
Spieth was terribly strong from tee to green and sets a good example.
The guttural screams of enthusiasm grew louder over the course of his lap as he lowered an important putt to decide the fourth four-point match for both of them, after he and Thomas had fallen behind after two holes with two points.
His putt, which chose the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream, suggesting that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“I really have to kneel down and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for the individual players.
18 holes to put a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, undoubtedly writing the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unequal but sympathetic duo stands at four out of four points and can’t do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” wasn’t the only couple who hadn’t beaten Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogey’s Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the overflowing crowd underpins that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to beat a possible European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-hero of the morning who played with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swedes into a jam they couldn’t nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the jam.
The four-and-four pairs are so fascinating to see up close due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way a strategy can change quickly.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this round of four has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe are ahead of the US with 10:6 after Saturday’s four- and four-way races and have a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, scoring four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to reclaim the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated in the fours in the morning against the wrong-playing American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four games, the US made more resistance and won two matches, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points in the twelve singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were baptized "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, were only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fours, they harmonized excellently and beat the delighted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the Fours in the morning, returned and played the Fours as a partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and three.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, not everything went according to their wishes.
Triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 win over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quadrennial, beating Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the quadrennial 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after going into the singles with a gap of four points, but as a title holder it is enough for Furyk's team to keep the trophy.
Having been in second place only for two days, it doesn’t look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen their mistrust of the United States and the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that last year North Korea had taken “substantial measures of good will”; for example, it had stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and pledged not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
“But we don’t see a corresponding reaction from the US,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will in no way disarm unilaterally first.”
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes demands for easing strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'first denuclearization' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and is even opposed to 'declaring the end of the war,'" Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to our knees is a ghost of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our suspicion.”
Ri did not address plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US head of state had highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party on the denuclearization issue instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris’ speech differed tremendously from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to use North Korea’s missiles to target the US mainland after “bad President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea’s “total destruction,” overwhelmed Kim with praise at the United Nations for his courage in terms of disarmament steps, but said much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday, “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must in any case be continued vigorously until we have achieved complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to financially dry up Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, when he left Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made only to be accused hours later by North Korea of making “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea vowed at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took “corresponding measures”.
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" sought were security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Sleep Enough in a Course
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year, a measure against the spreading macho culture of staying awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often needless when it comes to paying attention to themselves.
The course was conceived by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to launch the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why don’t I know about it until now, in my last year?’
After her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year’s course for the first time explained to students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and athletic performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university opted to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, students see the picture of a room in a dormitory and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
Then, using a map of the university campus with interactive symbols, they are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – just like you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of “pushing a night shift” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Ensuring enough good sleep should be the “secret weapon” of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and weight gain could be avoided as sleep deprivation puts the brain into hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, taking one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before starting their studies at the competitive university.
According to the recommendation of Professor Czeisler, students should prepare a wake-up alarm for bedtime and wake-up time, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emanates from electronic screens and LED lights, which can get the circadian rhythm off the clock, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga goal defeats Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's score for Steven Gerrard's disagreed team meant a 0:1 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first away victory since the 4:1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, so his team was eight points behind the by far leading Hearts in Ladbrokes' Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before halftime, and the low-inspiration Rangers seemed to have no chance of balancing.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and is only behind Hibernian at the goal difference.
The Rangers are also threatened with further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, overtaking Ayr and reaching the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who dropped a point from the Hearts last week, and would have to be thrilled at how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after just two minutes when Mengas first handed Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the rear pole.
The Rangers took control, but their game looked more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos obviously felt that he should have received a penalty kick after a quarter of an hour due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson did not accept the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's 34th minute match may not match the game, there is no denying that they deserved him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a ball shot long by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent in the half-time, and the change was almost immediately effective when the wing player put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they wanted, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving one long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor stood up well and repelled Jacobs before Lithgow threw a headball out of the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also demanded a late penalty kick after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our “Sunday Morning” almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The violin counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado with seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is this?”
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
By putting these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “In fact, I hear a crack!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name, however, lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Degenerate Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy decayed cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to detect decayed cells during treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient that are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a common protein of many cancers and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect decayed cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2 common to many cancers, and then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are taken immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade after appearing at SNL, wearing a MAGA cap (“Make America Great Again”).
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was buoyed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after he praised US President Donald Trump and said he wants to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", wearing a make-america-great-again cap, he continued with a mockery cannon against the Democrats, again stressing his support for Trump.
“I’m asked so often by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual harassment.
Although the recording of West's Schimpftirade wasn't broadcast, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the release about West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had difficulty behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They harassed me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
They harassed me!
And then they say I’m in a sunken area,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the sunken area?” He said, “He’s going to put on my Supermancape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. You want it to move forward with the world?
Try it with love.”
His remarks triggered buzzers from the audience at least twice, and SNL contributors were embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: “It was still dead in the studio.”
West had been hired late as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a talk entitled "I Love It", in which he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU THAT YOU HAS HAS BACKED YOU OF THE MASS.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted, however, that West was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I do NOT want to reward someone who, in my opinion, adopts an ideology harmful to my community and gives of himself (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now “The Being formally known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the deceased music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".
Prosecution for attempted murder in connection with stabbing injury in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was injured with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened, according to police in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Arbitration Court on Monday.
The allegations are reviewed by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Sword-Swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen resulted in boys often feeling like they needed to be strong in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believes something went wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who also appeared on "Game of Thrones," admitted that the solution to the problem was "very important."
“I personally find the question of what went wrong with masculinity very important right now,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now seeing?”
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is congenital, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes boys feel like they have to embody that particular side of a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
Something clearly went wrong with the young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer, he would not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones".
From November onwards, Harington will be featured in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him, the best thing about "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this show, so that’s how I got my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie starred in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the mistress of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married at Leslie's family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14°% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
Contrary to the past, transmission occurred in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 year-on-year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Based on the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men ultimately marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to inadequate protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, universal access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employees leaked data from GOP senators, criticizes “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the MPs' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles-based Democrat argued that the claims of “ultra-right” experts and websites would be spread.
“Lies, lies, and even more abhorrent lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information will include the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published during a Senate committee hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The release took place after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was assigned to Waters’ office, and released the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement prompted online criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are disclosed, and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
"Johnny English - You Only Live Three Times" - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-colored new film, and this seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy parody franchise "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with "Johnny English - The Spy Who Seventeened it" and came back to life in 2011 with "Johnny English - Now Right Now".
Will an ironic self-parody on how obviously stupid we are become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the crappy, incompetent, grimacing Johnny English has been renewed for the second time, while his name signals more than anything else that he is a general funny creation for cinemagoers in the non-English-speaking area.
Of course, he’s again the clumsy secret agent who bizarrely thinks he’s cool and worldly, while in reality he’s made up of something clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a bang of this guy who contributed a single note to the title melody of “The Winner’s Hour” at the 2012 Olympics in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos that left behind travellers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
Johnny English’s last adventure has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly dengled to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy emerges, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-confident comedic elements.
Humor seems to be directed more at children than adults, and to me Johnny English’s crazy misfortunes are not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gags in the role of Bean.
The perpetual premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents in operation, much to the displeasure of the acting agent, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and oppressed figure already facing complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Teresa May character, but the script doesn’t give much she can work with.
Their intelligence consultants inform them that all active spies have been excavated and therefore have to get them out of retirement.
This includes the foolish Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a fancy facility, but unofficially teaches as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested buddy Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman of higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are always doing everything terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action when they encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously caught in the ban of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause chaos as they smuggle aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house using a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all the registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the topic is already discussed in detail on children's television.
Pretty moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?”
Labour denies working on a plan that would allow the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is said to consider a radical plan that requires the British to work four days a week but to be paid for five days.
The party is reported to want business leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution in the form of an additional day off to workers.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "fits" the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort consistent with the Party’s approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and with the Party’s general industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to endorse such an idea, as the Green Party promised to launch a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this approach is currently not generally endorsed by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day week is not about party politics and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized at the Labour Conference last week his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profit-makers” in public utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not be able to recover their full share, as a Labour government could make “deductions” due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the boards of companies and set up inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees collecting annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in the news magazine "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court judge by at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence Republican senators to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open about it than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I announced at the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined, and unambiguous.”
However, Graham’s voice seems to be carved in stone.
“My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to blow a bomb,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett vehemently denied this,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all who called her could not confirm it.”
It is now 36 years.
And I can’t see any changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which is taking place this year for the 7th time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international stakeholder group seeks to fight poverty by motivating more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks, including volunteering, communicating with a leading politician around the world (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – to fight poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen remains 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of offering a cool free concert a sensible way to convince others that it’s time to take action, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think something can be changed by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reported that since 2011, the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters and achieve various goals.
These actions are said to have helped inspire leaders around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds secured so far have direct impacts on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who have pledged to support children in their optimal development and have pledged $35 million to help Rwanda fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition Ambassador, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the The Power of Nutrition project, which is aimed at reaching 5 million women and children and providing nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They answered, “It will be a long and strenuous way with highs and lows.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year’s event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as hosts.
U.S. could use navy for blockade purposes to impede Russian energy exports
According to Washington Examination, Washington can resort to the navy if needed so that energy from Russia does not reach markets including the Middle East, US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s deployment in Syria is a pretext for exploring new energy markets, and Russia is currently active in these areas at the invitation of the legitimate government.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s deployment in the Middle East is the negotiating of new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe,” he allegedly said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to address this.
“The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as a “voice of electricity consumers” in the US.
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically identical.
“Using and replacing fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, while calling Russia a “One Trick Pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the Trump administration was about to expand exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, with which, according to Trump, Berlin became the “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an strictly economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
“It is a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the board of the BDI, after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to ‘examine’ a 2020 presidential candidacy, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “examine” a presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “examine” a presidential candidacy after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is steering this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren’s criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, hasn’t taken a leaf to the mouth.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that an FBI investigation was necessary before the vote.
However, a poll released Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe they should run for 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe poll, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32% of voters supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy by former governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent opposing it.
Other names of prominent Democrats eligible for a 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden announced that he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin discusses post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump-Ralley, under which track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, all this can be felt by other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with,” she told audiences at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an “elephant in space” and said about her son and other war veterans that they’re coming back changed, that they’re coming back more chilled, that they’re coming back and wondering if there’s that respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military have given the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support an appeal on the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support an appeal against a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a court expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker questioning the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace versus Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been announced.
She said her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignored decades of legislation at the state, state and international levels.”
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle,” the court’s statement said.
The lawyers also argued that the policy of denying immigrants access to the country has an adverse effect on the U.S. economy, as immigrants may be more likely to work as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“Asylum is available for all those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or affiliation to a particular social group or political conviction,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
It has never been the plan to alleviate all problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people struggle with every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of fatalities in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming down her feverish son at a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their impregnated possessions and in the process to harvest everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and hospital staff damaged by the 7.5 earthquake were completely overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who pulled on vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated in the outskirts due to the ongoing severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the fierce earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went way too fast.
I think I was jammed under the fallen walls," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cries for help, but then there was stillness.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope they are in a safe place.”
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with ‘propaganda advertisements’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of exploiting the U.S. press for progaganda purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily’s paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling magazine, after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, an indictment China denies.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing has tried to meddle in the U.S. election is in line with U.S. officials’ message to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an expanding trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war should meet exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. ambassador to China and a former long-time governor of Iowa, which exports large-scale agricultural products to China, said Beijing has damaged workers, farm owners and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now doubling this tyranny by posting propaganda ads in its own free press in the US.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government claims America’s proven tradition of free speech and independent press by posting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find only a limited number of votes against the newspaper kiosks here in Beijing and not a real reflection of the differing views that the Chinese might have on the disturbing economic development of China, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that one of China's best-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not name the newspaper.
Republicans ravage voters before midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, observers warn
With many of the most influential Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a backlash during the upcoming interim elections that could come from women in particular.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already reported that they are continuing with a vote.
“Such things can’t be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute push for an FBI investigation is sufficient to soothe angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what was yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, first adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters in the hallway of the Senate shouted “November is coming!” when Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to stick to Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer on the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially with suburban voters and younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault on the Supreme Court candidate, observers suggested that a backlash could result if Republicans advance confirmation.
“This situation is a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about voting the board, voting the final vote or reviewing Kavanaugh; it’s also about how Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director at Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to disagree on who to believe based on the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share on the latter's side.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or likely convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% said they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38% said they believe that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied about his statement, while 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford made a swearing-in statement last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was attacked by drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate had exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing a competition to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination”.
“We need to take action now,” he said on the subject of startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology, allowing users to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the private and business sectors.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about personal online data storage is that the user alone can decide who can access which data.
The company refers to this concept as personal reinforcement and development of data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes, and capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on this project, a community of volunteer programmers, and a security platform acquired by IBM.
Earlier this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google on whether to make a comprehensive change that will completely reshape their entire business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial power generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victorian Cross in World War I, was honored
The only Church of England clergyman who was awarded the Victorian Cross during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award for his dedication in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic deed for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin; through dense fog and under heavy fire by field cannons and machine guns.
Later he advanced to the line of fire, leading the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before hurrying forward with a field weapon alone and decommissioning three of the military units.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s deeds were something he could never do, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid down a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he feels very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the bravery of a real hero will be visible primarily through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am then, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, spectators in the UK were not badly amazed when suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to specially watch the fight.
A fan described the move to the animated character on Twitter as somehow a bad joke.
“Due to a government regulation, this content is classified as non-aged, so it had to be switched to a children’s show at 6 a.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
“Peppa, the pig, exactly.”
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said the company will be working on the schedule to consider spectators from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could be solved in the repetition game,” he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday with the audience in the UK, and we won’t solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stick to it.
There was a lot of communication during the change. It was quite confusing and it wasn't always nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed it was a technical malfunction.
What was not the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We’re going to reduce it to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we’ve been trying to give fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite unfortunate.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “inferior” on the topic of sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated in various Olympic Games as a water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at the secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about gay rights to encourage others.
He also said, since he became a father, the victories at the Olympics are no longer so important to him.
The actual presenter of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses due to illness for a few months.
In Laverne's first show, he said that he used to consider himself inferior compared to others, as the love for boys and girls was totally socially unacceptable.
“To this day, the feeling of being inferior to others and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality, not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympics today is a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he had spoken on this issue because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The triple world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man came as an absolute surprise to him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that age difference has never been an issue.
He says if you had to go through so much as a child and teenager – he was 14 for the first time in the Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley says his whole view has changed since then.
Last year, it was all about gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main prize.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept imminent death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets to London 2012 as he wanted to be in the front.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until afterwards that it finally became clear to me that he wasn’t invincible,” he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I just knew that it’s always been my dream to dive in front of a local audience at the Olympics – that’s crazy,” he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by it. He heard the song in the run-up to the Olympics and still provided goosebumps.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits on the spare bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record at his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to do a lot of work so that it doesn’t turn into a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering on others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and therefore not an ideal cast for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself wasn’t daunting enough, Mickelson meets perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth game, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, newcomer to these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans put a hot start with four points behind in the 12 single games, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk was confident about Mickelson and couldn’t add much to it either.
“He was perfectly aware of his role today, knocked me on the back and put his arm around me and said he’s ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world-renowned personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn’t think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will hit Nick Faldo’s record for most of Sunday’s Ryder Cup games.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that never fully matched the peaks of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said that his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit more this week and it was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows it may soon be over with the lead
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead that leads to the last individual games in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only narrowly crossed the finish line and led with the smallest possible lead, winning a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
“The idea remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but that’s scarce,” said Bjørn (pictured in the photo) after seeing the 5-3 win of the Class of 2018 both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it is not over.
Tomorrow is really going on.
Put yourself in the stuff and do the right thing.
The whole thing is not over until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that is where our focus is.
I’ve always said I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re completely aware of what we’re facing on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Glad about the performance his players have accomplished on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never rush this.
Tomorrow will be a different caliber.
Tomorrow the individual services are in the foreground and that is a completely different thing.
It’s great to work with a partner if things go well, but if you’re out there alone, you’re tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make it clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you’re leaving your partner behind and he has to get the best out of it, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players perform better individually than on the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those big turns on the last day of the tournament, standing on the winning side in Brookline before standing on the losers' side after Europe's "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied to the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We’ve got 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the quick start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We’re setting up our team accordingly and sending our guys out the way we feel, you know, we’re trying to magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of competing against Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as further Europeans in the top half of the leaderboard.
“I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said of his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service already in 2014 to replace the warships from the Cold War period, however, according to local media, it will be delivered at the earliest next year due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that referred to a military spokesman.
The ship should have been commissioned in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by troubling problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are intended to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and naval target missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods; it should be possible that the latest frigates will not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the persistent delays can lead to the fact that the state-of-the-art warships, which are supposed to represent Germany as a maritime power, are already obsolete at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The Fregatte F125, which was followed by the accident, came in the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to take the ship off and gave it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware errors" that would have rendered the new ship useless in a battle situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is far too heavy, leading to performance losses and preventing the navy from carrying out upgrades in the future.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training cost of the crew, also became a problem.
Apparently, the cost rose to a staggering 3.1 billion euros, compared to the originally planned 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany’s maritime power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag’s defence commissioner, confirmed that the navy “is running out of operational ships”.
Bartels said the problem grew larger over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands to show how bats use the landscape in their food hunt.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insight into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track down dwarf and mosquito bat mice, as well as the brown long-eared and water bat mice in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
During a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and determines which species is doing what.
A map and report of the habitat is then drawn up to provide a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This data will help to identify the benefits of habitat management measures, such as meadow creation, and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or even attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo tracking to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the topic of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, sleeping place inspections and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for her.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t yet know about bats, so we’re doing this work here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He stresses the importance of excluding bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire population on site.
Bats are under protection and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have to learn a lot about bats and many of our species do not know what their populations are.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers want to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called allegations of rape against him “fake news” and said people want to be “famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence about the incident, according to The Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video of his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports “fake news” just hours after their release.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to become famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is good,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror for allegations they described as “inadmissible reporting on privacy suspicions.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player was demanding compensation for “moral damages at a level equal to the severity of the infringement, which is presumably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent a good guy" who was slain by the "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but say it was mutually agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries in a hospital but later entered into an out-of-court settlement because she was "fear of retaliation" and worried about being "officially humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to cancel the agreement as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and switched to the Italian giant Juve this summer in a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: UK would ‘repent forever’ the loss of car manufacturers
The UK would “repent forever” if it lost its status as a world’s leading automaker after Brexit, according to Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He said it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby should Britain leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis product lines are produced, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that in the event of an uncontrolled Brexit, we will see production stops at our plant at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard EU exit without an agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, are related to risks within the supply chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s production facility is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, meaning that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be disruptions at the borders that could lead to delays and bottlenecks in parts, according to the industry.
It is impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock at the plant in Derbyshire that is sufficient for more than a day, the company explained why production needs to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa May’s Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU “is precisely designed to avoid such border controls.”
"We need a deal, we want the best deal that, like I said, allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for another week,” while the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of special investigator Robert Mueller, who is investigating election interference by Russia, connections between Trump’s advisers and Russia, as well as a possible impediment to justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy justice minister and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump and the impeachment of the president using the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday as new reports of his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for next Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid clashing with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for it; it could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
It will be clear, but I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of press conferences was not due to a dislike of the TV reporter's "effect hashish," but admitted: "I would not deny that they are doing effect hashish."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is doing more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him,” she said, without providing precise evidence: “We’ve looked at these numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, though, “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly questions, it is far better than to talk to me.
We try to do this often, and you have seen that we have done this many times in the last few weeks, and that will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with attending dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he dropped an out-of-the-row and sometimes bizarre performance in front of assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes about Brexit concerns about EU workers of the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health addresses people from outside the EU who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralized public service of Scotland.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the course of summer, the exit negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what disturbing times this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency operation following a head injury he suffered in the 31-27 defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a carrier and transported for further investigation.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told WSMV’s Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has left surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details about the nature or extent of the injury are yet known" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called red shirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after moving over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, which increased his total number in the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for UK property purchases
Investors from abroad will have to charge a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future. The additional revenues are to benefit the homeless according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This step aims to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to increase revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamping fee if they buy real estate in the UK, with the over-income aiming to benefit the homeless.
This step represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, promising to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in the stamp tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and the additional income will be contributed to the government's campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is levied in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and residential properties left for rent, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the move to increase revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are purchased by investors outside the UK, driving prices up and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, became "spirit cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows just a few weeks after Boris Johnson advocated a stamp tax cut to allow more young people to get their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable homes to end Britain’s “living space disgrace.”
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a striking series of proposals for housing reforms, ranging from a rental price commitment to a ban on eviction for no good reason.
He also wants to give city councils more powers to build new apartments.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that lives should be better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right that for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, it is as easy to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of homelessness has become too far away for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness continues to be too great a problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says his ‘biggest goal’ is to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the club from the north-east of England, which is currently in third place in the League One and missing three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish First League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country.
I made it to the bank and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But as a child, I’ve often seen Scotland play in Hampden with my father and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this opportunity would only come if I were successful in the management of the club."
Ross' predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and possibilities in this club, he is undoubtedly in the Premier League."
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only see my time here as a success if I brought the club back there.”
Ross has a three-year management career, following a phase as Deputy Chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month career as a coach at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever before in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“That was probably a real divergence,” he remembers when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than just playing.
It sounds funny because I wasn’t doing badly, I could live well from it and I experienced some very pleasant high stages.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I’m still going through this in terms of the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage, and now I’m doing it. I’ve never felt so comfortable in my skin in my entire adult life.”
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30 between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Sportsound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time for a glass of beer is on Saturdays at 5:30 pm, according to a study
The heatwave in the summer has missed revenues from Britain’s crunching pubs, while restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
In July, pub and bar companies recorded revenue growth of 2.7 percent, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “Persistent sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, where pubs saw sales increases of 2.8 percent, but it was even harder for restaurants.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Beverage-focused pubs and bars showed by far the best performance, with area-adjusted sales growth rising higher than it dropped at restaurants.
Pubs focusing on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent per month, while food sales fell three percent.”
Paul Newman, an analyst for the recreational and restaurant industry RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we have been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, some as young as 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that keep them secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools found an increase in so-called “Fake Insta” sites
The news sparks fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students reported having a “main account” to show it to their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that it can keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “Fake Insta” accounts, similar to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message sparks fears that sexual content is being shared.
Twenty percent of students reported having a clean “main account” that they can show to their parents, but also own private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools’ Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being tempted to create online rooms where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes ‘voice of athletes’ at the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from her far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election to the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, named a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and now frequently appears as a BBC expert, was unable to run after a temporary circulation disorder.
He tweeted: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell if or how far I will recover.
It was hard work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for breast pumps that compares mothers to cows creates excitement in the net
A manufacturer of breast pumps caused excitement on the net with a promotional clip in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
For the market launch of the "world's first low-noise portable breast pump", the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie publishes a non-serious music video to emphasize the freedom that gives the pump to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with hay with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text like, "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a cock on me" or "if you haven't noticed, these are not uters but my breasts."
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the ads posted on the company’s Facebook page have sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video stumbled upon mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say it discredits the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their babies will be taken away from them within a few days of birth."
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment read: “Traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don’t we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another person added, “Such a non-reality advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement and one woman admitted that she found the song "funny".
“I think that’s an ingenious idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt exactly like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to over-interpret it.
It’s a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use breast pumps (often at the workplace or on toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone has danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use breast pumps report feeling like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all the associated challenges while simultaneously presenting in an entertaining and comprehensible way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump allows.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were silently taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of interned migrant children is higher than ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, including as tighter rhetoric and Trump administration measures have made it harder to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers were themselves illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become the target for expulsion themselves when they sign up to take in a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would have to leave their fingerprints and share that data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either their own caregivers or members of a caregiver’s household are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That’s why we will continue to persecute these people,” Albence said.
In order to handle the children’s cases faster, officials introduced new rules, which, according to the staff of the shelters, require some children to appear in court within a month instead of 60 days after detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video instead of in person to advocate for their legal status in front of an immigration judge.
In the event of negative decisions, the person is quickly deported.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to accommodation staff and reports released over the past month from the system, that they become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns are heightened with a larger facility like Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems, due to the size, are more easily overlooked.
They also explained that it can intensify traumas that many of the children already suffer if they are brought to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria Calls on US, French, Turkish ‘Occupation Forces’ to Withdraw Immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s civil war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism and were “treated accordingly”.
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus “will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has stationed about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs hired against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return are set and he accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” to prevent refugees from going home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable return home,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib provided an opportunity for political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide-ranging offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action would be carried out against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front allied with Al-Qaeda, which will be “deleted”.
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem cited the Syrian government's conditions for participation in the committee, stating that its work should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020 if not, as many liberal viewers presumably hope, an impeachment or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time.”
So far, there is no indication that the spectators would be tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s best broadcast time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC’s nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the ratings to 3.5 million viewers on nights with important news.
“It’s like a fire that magically attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series Designated Survivor on ABC about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
Chaos is worth entertainment.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything found on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible reunification of families, and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen, if you become aware of having already watched six hours of an expert round about Bob Woodward’s use of sources from the so-called “deep background” for his book “Fear”, Paul Manaforts $15,000 expensive ostrich leather bomber jacket (according to Washington Post, a “clothes piece rich in self-esteem” disproves of the impact of Daniel’s “Deep Background”).
I will never be able to see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Part of what he’s doing feels like a reality show he introduces to you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series The Three from the Pantry, about Trump’s rotating cast and daily action (a fight with the NFL football league to break off the fence, Kim Jong-un praising).

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his home on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crept inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn’t get off the screen, not when Judge Candidate Brett Kavanaugh was on the verge of testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donations flood the closest races for seats in Congress in the midterm elections
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is flooded with donations, thanks to the new boundaries of the districts that led to two incumbents running for the same seat.
The recently redrawn suburb district in Pittsburg is running for Democrats Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the constitution and were manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of campaign funding between the parties’ major financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a much-respected special election in March around the state's 18th district.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump gained a 20 percent lead there.
Political experts give the Democrats easy leadership.
The U.S. reviewed El Salvador’s punishment for its support for China, but then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump held a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valero and owned a hotel in Panama until partner dismissed the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, penalties were considered, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting in the previous year and represented a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving toward the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of penal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October to mark the importance the government places on the assembly, diplomats said.
The three U.S. diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new harsh communications or penalties from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed on condition of anonymity to comment on the internal meetings.
Their comments were reaffirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next big surprise could be special investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible impediment to justice, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public eye.
Mueller is also allegedly investigating whether Trump’s campaign team conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the congressional majority changes, Trump will face an organ that forces him to account precisely at the moment he passes to stand again in front of the voters; and possibly in front of a jury.
Those are many ‘ifs’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had merely resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Devil’s kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was unsuitable for office.
Rosenstein denies the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed in office despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and falsehood?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these trials, we will have a long winter ahead of us.
But I do not think we will fail, because of what I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistically ahead of the match against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not show up until the 2-2 tie against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone for bigger.
“That was an important point for us because Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can do something about it and we drove home with a point.
Maybe we could still win in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked hard in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this is going to be a tough game because they scored a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we can do that with the audience behind us and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Fear of retirement leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a major factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own fortune — as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Turn over litigation at the last minute.
Establish a precautionary authority so that you have a familiar person supervising your medical care and ensuring that health care professionals meet your wishes should you be unable to express them yourself.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid should you not be able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication use or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is the drug treatment?”
Who cares about the dog?
You already have this plan done.”
Man shot in Ilfracombe several times with air gun
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shootings that occurred around 02:30 British time as "an arbitrary act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police were looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami hitting the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities.
Due to the failed communication systems, aid workers were unable to obtain information from the government district of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-strong earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi that extends over a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the governing district, an administrative unit below the province, an estimated 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the Central Sulawesi economy, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Civil Protection Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific ring of fire, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, nearly half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-strong earthquake rocked southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 rocked one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and claiming about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the governing district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from falling buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular with tourists, and claimed more than 500 deaths, especially on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska’s former governor and former vice president candidate, has been arrested on charges of bodily harm.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resistance to state power, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, he picked up a friend’s phone when she wanted to notify the police.
Palin is under detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 deposit has been collected.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he was asked for his plea, responding with “Not guilty, sure,” according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three Class A misdemeanors, which can be punished with up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which can be punished with one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being brought before the Alaska Veteran’s Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran organizations for referring her son’s behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-strong earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terrorist Attack
The prosecutor's office in New York is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terrorist attack, which claimed eight lives, a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a leased pickup truck from Home Depot for a terrorist attack, in the course of which he rushed on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October while crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, the accusers must prove that Saipov “targeted” the eight offers and “consciously” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the declaration of intent for the death penalty demand filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court of inquiry, Saipov, filed a 22-point indictment of the murder against the background of organized crime, which is usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as an indictment of the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “basic planning and intent,” according to the prosecutors, who described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as “abominable, cruel and corrupt.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted damage, pain and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York in a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, witnessed a lack of repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov explained to authorities that he was inspired to the act after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also demanded, according to police, that the ISIS flag be hanged in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a guilty confession in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma that all involved suffer,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the charge not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP Calls for NIGEL FARAGE to Transfer Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest action within the framework of the Tories Conference.
The former Ukip party leader said politicians “must feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May’s party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbenchman Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “already outside” if Farage was Brexit minister.
The challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply disputed party has been compounded by the fact that members of her party who are in favour of staying in the EU participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit proponents, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the backlash, it should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between its package and “chaos”.
Bone explained at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘chequers belong to the trash’.
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed as a peer and should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for it, we would be out already,” he explained.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but Chequers is on the trash.”
Emphasizing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns’ Brexit supporter was also at the demonstration, telling reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public eye, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually going through the streets and making sure we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a shouting message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Ministers will keep their jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage said in a speech that politicians must “feel pressure” should they be in the process of cheating on the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat on Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘You won’t get away with it.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: “I want you to feel the pressure of our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, which has helped us win the referendum and will never come to rest, as long as we are not an independent, self-administering, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A few activists swung banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party that was launched over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security issues with a party app when opening the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, just like all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland are there,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine’ presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the November elections she would “examine the presidential candidacy closely.”
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for Senate re-election against Republican MP Geoff Diehl in Massachusetts Parliament, who was vice chairman of Trump’s campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the center of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was their 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after death shooting on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of the deadly shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for assistance in identifying the man to be seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury to the head and died as a result of this injury," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene and possessing a gun and having shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre-long Sim grew up in Baton Rouge, playing in 32 games with 10 startups last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after his team left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes’ Stallorder would play a big role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas made a good start and it was almost as if he performed Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went into the box and pushed Hamilton into traffic at the end of the driver’s field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box a lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a short wheel-to-wheel maneuver, in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside, with the risk of enduring after two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the back seats of the field and was ranked seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race, as he held on to his tyres to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually went into the box in the 44th round and failed to make one step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me by.
The team has done an excellent job of achieving a double win," Hamilton said.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election event on Saturday, which insisted on not passing on Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not speak directly to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are “bad, wicked, and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and evil and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at the leaks and then say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Remember your answer... Published the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
Okay, just a moment, please.
No, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator's voice.
Feinstein was credited with Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it was published in early September, though Feinstein denies that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter a secret and I responded to her request for secrecy.”
Her denial didn’t seem to get well with the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election campaign event: “I’ll tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his ongoing defense of the judiciary candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, he claimed that Democrats would use the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the meanness, the wickedness, they don’t care who they hurt if they let them get under the wheels to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for the defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday by a 5:3 win in the rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early with two goals, after hitting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made up for the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard matched for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, the third defeat in the Elite League of the season.
This was the fourth encounter of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute after a 3:35-minute run by Kendall McFaull, and four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the run when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie to his balancing goal after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the half-time break when he scored his second goal of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard matched up again with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half, and Nielsen secured his team the victory with a fifth goal after just under half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home at Milton Keynes Stadium on Friday.
Air traffic controller died after making sure that hundreds of people on an airplane escaped the earthquake
A flight attendant in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died to safely take off a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavily fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was falling.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Indonesia’s Aviation Security Service, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message,” he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the country’s civil protection agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached," said official Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, saying in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you to work all day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia has already been shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now reports missing man after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight crashing into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reporting a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they could not say anything about the whereabouts of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in stable condition.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade through deep hip water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve a berth rushed with an inflatable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people were killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday closed its evidence in the retrial of a case in which a man is accused of having exiled a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has spoken for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night using cell phone calls.
Rowlett said he received position data from various mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period when he alleged to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness stand on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he claimed to have been in Sanford’s pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied “because my pick-up was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers at the time of her death for two weeks.
However, cell phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis leaked their messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He removed her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the trial will then go to the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that Hip Hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to go back to their roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for laying off after 'racist' SMS
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother that she was “yet a black woman.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the litigation with “extortion”.
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEIN, Yet A BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After acknowledging her faux pas, the “embarrassingly touched” Plasco-Flaxman Maurice fired, claiming that the open-minded African-American nanny had done a bad job and expected her to be a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal, claiming compensation for the $350 a day they should have been booked for over six months, the job for which they had originally been booked, but without a contract, and for which they would have lived with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do that,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, arguing that firing was the reasonable step as they feared Maurice could no longer trust them after insulting them.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to “extortion” and stated that his wife is expecting a baby in just two months and is “in a difficult situation”.
“You want to sue such a person?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
As the lawsuit continues, the couple was quickly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book’s adoption, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
Today it’s very funny with our knowledge today about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, would have had no problem with it, his work would have been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the release after his death last year was "bitter-sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington’s success, which she describes as a “very important family member.”
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t brag,” Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a kid doing something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for his success.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad, telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly sounded off and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together.”
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane along with the other passengers who did not notice anything of what she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Griefing Women Hang Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridges
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide are trying to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and phone numbers for counseling centers.
Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to have to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was on the verge of a promising career as a cook and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room.”
However, he quit his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s body was found after the suicide of his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, “I’m always worried that this could have an impact.”
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent: you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was dating 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was at the bottom, and when the children packed their presents, he didn’t see them in the eyes or anything.”
She said his death was a great trauma for her, but that had to go through: “It’s tearing a huge hole into the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is on the run as the FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get something he was asking for, that is, a timely and limited investigation, then maybe we could get a little agreement,” Flake said on Saturday. He fears that the committee will “break apart” in the party-political stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Their reluctance can only be attributed to the timing.
The midterm elections on November 6 are only five weeks away, and if Republicans performed poorly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and met through him his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to decide on equal votes, and to confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflowers ‘sink’ under Kim
The number of North Korean overruns to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, based on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said 1127 overflowers were registered last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as major factors.
Pyongyang did not speak publicly.
The vast majority of North Koreans are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the overflowers as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often leads them back with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had been discontinued.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US sanctions of the lack of progress.
“Without trusting the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Mir Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit for Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was characteristically unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who acted like this would have been described as ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional; sometimes he almost screamed and was about to break out in tears as he talked about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated homicide” organized by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election lost.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s statement proves that he could not serve in the Supreme Court as she shows that he was biased toward Democrats.
“I think he himself has declared himself unfit with these statements and the way he spoke about the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if he were to be confirmed and the Democrats should win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say so much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judgeship,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi further said that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would revise certain Supreme Court decisions.
“We don’t now need a hysterical, biased person to go to this court and expect us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She continued, “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cries when she gets angry but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, tell the person she said to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keep talking.
I found it genius.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a male-dominated office, where one day I cried because of indescribable anger and was pulled by an older woman, a chilled manager, for whom I was always a little afraid, by the collar and pulled into a staircase.
“Never let her see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re stinking.
They believe you’re sad and will be satisfied with themselves because they believe you’ve gone into the substance.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and subsequently withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy himself.
“That wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’.
As the election campaign was already advanced, she was behind the fundraiser and vowed not to run if she didn’t get $2 million together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only supported her campaign with $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked herself.
She was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and address voters directly instead of delegates, and the anger at sexism that she was close to tears.
“It could have been assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have thought that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I still remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
Why Beijing Could Benefit from U.S.-China Trade War
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is not over yet, Beijing could benefit from a trench between the countries in the long run, my experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed fines on key Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new penal duties on $200 billion worth of goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Beijing slammed every time in the same way, recently raising penalties of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China swore to respond to any U.S. action and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon stumble.
Moving Washington to deflect would mean giving in, but a public crackdown on the US would be far too disgraceful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turmoil in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized,” says Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country devastated by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that circumstances in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now set for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomed assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe made a victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won back the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over most of the tournament, lowered his tee on the 16th track (par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in Team Europe, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the best ranking in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I’m so happy to win the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have made a contribution,” said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the singles matches.
“I’m so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I’ve watched on TV since I was a child,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who made high-profile performances throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the guys, they’ve fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players performed well.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
