Obama Receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama-advertised deal on Iran’s nuclear program has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the then-forthcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his “sweet dog” was still alive and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could reverse it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office, according to police.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the disastrous emergency call sometime afterwards.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police encapsulated him.
A day after the shooting at the university, forcing students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him testified, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm told him that at the end of the 2014-15 academic year he was dealing with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons, saying he had any health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he did not know of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously there was something in Mr Lamb's performance."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent’s home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to that house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for a few years to teach her the guitar playing.
He was the women's swarm at the time.
All the girls melted there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife,” but there was no document of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said they were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
“She was totally devastated,” O’Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared at a summer annual market three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night for the last time on the night of September 5 after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica game in front of a sparse audience.
There was no indication that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people attended a candlelight commemoration ceremony on Tuesday evening, including faculty, staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, while the university school sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students to return,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say Lamb made the emergency call after shooting Schmidt, and that Lamb, while in his emergency call, referred to Prentiss as his wife, there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says it will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, with 45,000 more being hired during the Christmas season in 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox Jokes About 'Date' With Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a big professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I realize the seat next to me is empty, and it’s gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me,” he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, Back in Time.
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I’m a simulated yawning and an arm length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
“Back for the Future” premiered 30 years ago.
“It’s really for me,” Spielberg said, “undisputedly the biggest time travel film ever made.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria as they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 polls that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others rejected him as a joke.
Some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit field, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the opportunities of nomination of the real estate mogul.
It is, of course, too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at that time in 2011 Rick Perry’s leadership was given to the ascending Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump’s endurance and are starting to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey figures suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten people say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are true in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “angry” if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are “enthusiasm” vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next in enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “angry” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation’s first-ever landmark state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively do his job, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That’s a change since four out of ten people put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to just 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change their minds.
46% said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus of public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday’s new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do so.
The frustration over the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now accounting for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post Monday poll say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
They are also angry at Washington.
A poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “hellishly upset.”
Munich, Sylt and Co.: Germany’s five most exclusive residential areas
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea watt.
On the street, a square meter of a reed roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"The supply of objects is naturally limited to Sylt," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student lodge in Munich is not really little.
In contrast to Germany’s top residences, however, one of the prizes is peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square metre prices in dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, well remembered.
Well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is exceptionally not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run.
Thomas Müller’s lucky goal paved the way for FC Bayern to a well-deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus – then it went.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the witch's kettle of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their start game in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götzes's score (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth success in series is expected to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
In his 28th goal in the Champions League, Müller was kindly helped by Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who passed a shot of the world champion, which was thought to be a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game at the Karaiskakis stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining.
Piraeus had won his latest six home games in the royal class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled (1:3).
However, Bavaria, unconquered in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They responded boldly, but often too inventively in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by relocating the game to the left Douglas Costa, which rarely passed against the former Brunswicker Omar Elabdellaoui.
From the right, Müller was more fortunate than his flank struck from the right half-field in the upper left toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion forgave the possible 2-0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best chances in half one.
Initially, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat the header of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct takeoff, goalkeeper Roberto pared with his knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needle stitches.
But the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was relying on.
When he sent a shot of Ideye over the bar (56.)
Before Neuer Guardiola defended a four-piece chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which did well.
Mario Götze, back in the squad after muscular problems, was initially sitting outside.
The World Cup hero had only given the green light after graduation training, sports director Matthias Sammer told "Sky": "Whoever wants to make something different from it, that is already malicious".
Guardiola also decided against him at the first change, when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59.).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by penalty, Müller put one more on it.
Before the match, there were riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly mummy Bavarian fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the followers of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and went against the Munich followers with sticks.
At least one Bayern fan was injured transported from the stadium.
People who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth.
Anyone who smokes does not only harm the lungs, but also the teeth - this is suggested by a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is shown by the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at 2.5 to 3.6 times higher risk of losing their teeth prematurely.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, stresses the DIFE.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum infections among smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to return to the level of non-smokers, said lead author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
Heiner Boeing, head of the study at DIFE, said: “Smoking shortens lifetimes.”
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health until old age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIFE said.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists find remains from late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological finds have been made repeatedly on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-German museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called land monuments.
For all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialist office for archaeological soil monument conservation.
Archaeologists have now been able to find the third section of the Rhine boulevard.
It was already known from textual documents that there was a fortress in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman has been killed at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asks the people for help.
Early on Wednesday morning, at about 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the track from the station building at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
By capturing the train, she has suffered the most serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was medically treated on site and taken to a hospital by rescuers.
The investigating officials have no knowledge of the reason for the young woman's nightly crossing of the track.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Information about the cause of the accident can be given at the 24-hour and free hotline of the Federal Police at 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To alleviate the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration mechanisms for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its operation corresponds to significantly more traditional courts.
"We want to put in place a system that citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the presentation.
The Swedish woman intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the world’s largest free trade area with 800 million people.
Concretely, the plans to reform the current arbitration process require EU states and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They are supposed to come in equal parts from the EU, the US and third countries.
A second instance is also planned for the first time.
It would allow you to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators among themselves, but there was no possibility of objection to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she wants to work towards an International Investment Court, according to her own data.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be resolved.
The Investor-State Arbitration (ISDS), which is mainly required by large corporations, is considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice through which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, override national laws, or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact called the European Commission’s proposals insufficient.
In particular, it was criticized that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as great progress.
The Commission takes into account key points in the reform, which Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel and other EU trade ministers worked out in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the possibilities of lawsuits by way of too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) can be concluded, remains unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should be available by the end of this year.
This date is no longer durable.
Delicatessen Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to it is a flipchart, on which the shy-looking folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost captured by Steven’s lecture.
He tells through various places, which he repeatedly inscribes on the map, about what his minute and delicately arranged songs tell about.
Where they were born and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderful creative insane.
With the 2003 album Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State, cleverly composed songs appear that harmoniously blend very closely with late-sixties American folk, but can drift into great opulent at any time.
It is rumored that "Michigan" would be the first part of a bold series: each of the 50 states should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and in the vicinity of the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks certain expectations positively.
Reduced, Stevens is here.
Live is enough for him, guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a widely acclaimed masterpiece is released in 2005.
Excessive of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any annual chart of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic composites.
This sixth decent studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats, and plays with all sorts of effect and hall.
Long since the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark kept hamburger More!
Theater he presents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now seated in their chairs here, the much more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays themselves through the broadly enriched album.
From the audience you hear that the lecture is "more opulent" and you can thus "throw away the plate basically".
Only to an addition, Stevens humblely thanks, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows with coughing applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's questionnaire
Mr. Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's questionnaire has been eagerly awaited since his election
New Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn is due to make his debut at the Prime Minister’s questionnaire and quarrel with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will stand up to ask the first of his six predefined questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be reviewed by the media and Labour MPs up close.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip a few sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr. Corbyn’s leadership, as she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour president’s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he had “confessed in respectful silence” and had acknowledged the “heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England.”
But a member of Mr. Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem “independent” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr. Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in economics, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC’s political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also “stacking” within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn’s remarks on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is proposing changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said the party was “very clear” that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman who has faced David Cameron, since he was Tory’s head, over the last decade across the dispatch box in parliament.
The Labour chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has “crowd-sourced” ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister’s questionnaire is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both “beating skill” and arguing with hooks, and instead set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also brought into conversation the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "casperle theater", which is often linked to the Prime Minister's questionnaire, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed to do so.
Since it was first aired on TV in 1990, the questionnaire with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of a leader’s ruling and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, despite critics arguing that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shooting in Joburg': Homeless youth trained to become photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take pictures of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound jumped according to data indicating an increase in the UK's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage was the fastest and most accurate estimate of the timing of an interest rate increase since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20% jump after rival AB InBev’s takeover offer was received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9%, according to encouraging news from the Richemont luxury goods group.
Richemont’s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed sales in China – a key market for Burberry – reported growth again.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it earned $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The stocks of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, down 4.3% after Goldman Sachs put its rating for the company to "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are jeopardizing expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could hit JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lapish 21 years young, a hangover with over-chic Frieze.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Rather even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is turning around.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard of the name "Ritz Carlton".
It's okay.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Pole has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: This is where your idol lives, whose posters have been hanging in Stettin since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much a day as her mom Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Wiktoria would have to be in high school in 10th grade."
“I’m fulfilling her dream.”
School duty?
Who's itching?
Not the fans.
Neither did Bieber himself.
He's taken care of it anyway.
For the ads in the Superbowl’s ad break, he raised three million, while a two-year deal with an anti-pickel firm washed many, many dollars into Bieber’s account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks a cup of coffee, you are astonished at the window.
More than 100 million is said to have been taken.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others stress that Bieber is finally in the US and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at number 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is scheduled to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to cardboard pitcher idea
Potatoes or Döner?
We can do both - in the Kartoffeldöner, which the Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a spear.
On the idea he got a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of donners", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, in his shop, there has been a barbecue spear, which is filled with meat and potatoes.
“This is multiculti for the stomach,” says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese Patent Office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
How much meat and potatoes the steak contains, Alhay does not want to reveal.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of the peoples is also well received by its customers.
Metcash Launches Soil Consistency Campaign to Combat Aldi Incidence
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores from an Aldi surge in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a soil conservation campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo distributing samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted South Australian Football League tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and equipment wholesaler is conducting its annual investor strategy day.
Much is at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will snatch away about five percent of the food market in these two states, and will take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating revenues of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery store and in the amounts on Metcash’s high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash’s food and grocery sales to fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it is believed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has dropped by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reduction while putting pressure on revenue and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back and investing more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, improving IGA retailers in improving their stores through fast-growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash’s chief executive, Ian Morrice, says the price adjustments and store rehabilitation programs are set to go up, hoping the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Australian tennis federation president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and, in the opinion of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, repeatedly referred to as the "Special Ks", came into the spotlight through Kyrgios' notorious confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a spasm thwarted a potential US Open win by Richard Gasquet, Healy’s Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against Britain.
“One thing I’m quite jealous of is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi was a little drawn into the dispute,” Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost to the US Open because of a seizure, but he’s not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US open, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merit.
Healy also supported the decision to disregard Kyrgios in the important preliminary ruling, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assured the Canberra man to return as a long-term permanent part of the team.
“First, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not all the controversies around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick made the rise very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions at the best. Some time out of the spotlight, I think it's just the best, and I think it's the best.
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining all who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed on the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man’s land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
As a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants chanted “Open the border!” and shouted insults against the Hungarian ready police.
Some rejected food and water for protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary as more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks must take place in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serb border came a day after the 28-nation bloc could not agree on a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed, however, to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overwhelmed Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not place its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and a point of entry into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming countries are economic refugees seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection – a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also establish higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to agree to the military's deployment, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, the country’s security adviser for Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
The authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a barbed wire train carriage had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushed a crowd to push into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 Election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halves in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is winning over her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primary elections (58 percent before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether to run for president, receives support from 15 percent of the Democratic constituents of the primary elections.
More than five months before the presidential elections begin, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say their opinions are firm on which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders made some profits.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but those protrusions have decreased.
Their support for the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton’s advantage among Democratic voters under 50 has faded, and she and Sanders are now on par.
But Clinton still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a two-point lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
Approximately half of the Democratic constituents in the primary elections nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her only because she is the candidate.
6 percent wouldn’t support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the belief that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention their connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
Consent to deal with the problems and the selectability are also cited.
As the vice president throws potential for the presidential office into the scales, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters want to see him in the race — though a third believes he shouldn’t.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democrats, Hillary Clinton’s lead to Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, that figure has dropped by 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second on this measurement, but the percentage that considers him to be the "most selectable" has increased.
Nevertheless, when asked what is more important to a candidate, Democratic voters raise questions about electability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform well on some important traits among electors of their party’s primary elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.
Biden scores best on honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton’s strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t think so.
Democratic primary voters generally also see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked during her tenure as foreign minister, most Democratic voters in the primary elections are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that it has not overall influenced her opinions.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third is satisfied.
Public opinion on this matter was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of her had worsened.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party’s voters, this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of voters do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also view Trump as unhonest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good scores in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush scored best with honesty.
A majority consider Sanders more honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson gets close to Donald Trump in a nationwide poll
Ben Carson in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates are now accounting for half of voter support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, with support rising from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27% in Tuesday’s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson does well with demographic groups and Trump outperforms Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated by Wisconsin’s Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, released last week, shows Carson is rising in the polls — he ends up at 19% Republican support, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side blows for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s beliefs.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing holidaymakers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea at a maximum of 17 degrees should be a rather short pleasure.
Some people don’t go into the sea anymore: The water in the North and Baltic Seas has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
The Mediterranean, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees.
Five Brotherhood Members Burdened with Death of Baruch College Newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during an abusive ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013, delaying his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about a headache, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng passed out and were supposedly waiting an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the welfare of the brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly injured with blunt force on the head, hull and thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood, and at least one student has died of harassment every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassing attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We don't just want to hold the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its membership in the local group.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
An interest rate hike is coming, and the hikes will falter, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long this will last and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period required for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that all the excitement may have been exaggerated due to an interest rate hike.
“The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of ‘cheap money’,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal heights, but still to low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historically trend-based look at how some sectors of the economy might react:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for asset income to be squeezed 12 to 24 months after the first increase, perhaps reflecting again the delay in monetary policy,” German bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
More specifically, the market has been mostly on the upward trend over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days afterwards (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4 percent in the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis released by the Asge set at the Bob Doll, Chief Investment Board.
Deutsche Bank said the impact on the stocks tends to occur later in the upward cycle and the return is beginning to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
Most notably, gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question “whether it’s different this time around,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have set their sights on a Fed interest rate hike throughout the year, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week ending Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study, all of the increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP, shading pre-recession heights very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and that’s 74 months so far.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase, and the pattern is pretty similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic price.
For bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/reduction occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields drop immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to shrink closer and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although “we’re still cautious to expect higher returns,” Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that markets have already adjusted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded, and volatility has increased – all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
On the whole, companies that do the bulk of their business in the U.S. will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and so does financing their debts.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Strong-balance sheet companies averaged 5 percentage points higher than weak-balance sheet companies after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rate increases.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility in their shares also surpassed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher yields, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for its "dumping"
He argues that he is increasingly indifferent from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only mimic The Brits.
Member of Parliament Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said it wasn’t very original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms" to Classic FM, a leading MP claims and increases new pressure on the station to prove that it is doing something private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public radio station was “dumb” and increasingly undifferentiated from its commercial competitors.
“Radio 3 seems — I don’t like using the word “dumb” — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last year, seem to be under another name.
So if you’re trying to do something else – these are two spontaneous examples where you’re actually just imitating what’s already on the market,” said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director General rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I’m learning from Radio 3 I’m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there’s a commitment to live music and music making that’s truly unmatched.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to finding new music and commissioning new works, I also think is really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that harder work needs to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport Selection for trampling on the commercial rival.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "in a special BBC manner".
He added that he hopes the company “finds a hit from our in-house stable” when it launches an entertainment series the next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or spend money from the payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday slowed spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000, with only five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
“If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, then that has always evolved over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is swinging, and we may see growth slowing.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe buyers are holding back their purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers were fighting for bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of <0xC2><0xA3>5 spending, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in downtown fashion chains.
Muslims Buried in Mecca in Crane Accident - Bin Laden's Family Sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia blames part of the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca’s Great Mosque.
Mourners, largely dressed in white, filled the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead made their last trip to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed at the Holy Place, where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on those who prayed.
The bodies were released for funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden family construction company over the disaster that also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 worshippers who were killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin Laden group should not have let the arm of the crane stand when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden Group was jointly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hajj, which is taking place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of Krans, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also rebuked the group for non-current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is responsible for major construction projects.
Al Qaeda’s deceased leader, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just days before millions arrived in the kingdom for the pilgrimage needed at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered 1 million rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to be paid to the relatives of those killed and the same amount of permanently injured.
Others will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has grown
This leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who perform the work in their homes.
If you can skillfully handle painting walls with a hammer or brush, nowadays you seem to belong to a minority.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, Kingfisher’s new Managing Director, who owns the construction stores chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has now been outdated.
Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops for craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men outweigh the staff.
She said it was necessary to address the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, with 80% of the decisions about women’s purchases.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a leading British company listed on the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have exactly 50 percent of the team filled with women, including its management and CFO.
Mrs. Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
At the state court in Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball deputy champion Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse of office.
He was legally acquitted of this charge in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it was crystallized that the defendants used funds from club accounts, which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions, for private purposes between 2006 and 2011.
The damage amounts to around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial misconduct.
This fact was removed by the chairman of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
In order to condemn the infidelity, the defence explained that the association had not at any time suffered a disadvantage in its assets.
The sports officials would have only offset expenses and brought out of debt the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600,000 shillings (about 44,000 euros).
"At that time we were faced with the situation: will we continue to run the club or will we lock it up?" said one of the defendants, a large-scale auditor of the tax office in the bread profession.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
“We have raised money, put our life insurance as collateral at the bank,” he said.
It was agreed with the association: they can manage the money freely, only no debts may be made.
Furthermore, the payment of the expenses was decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, some of the expenses were not paid until years later, i.e. from 2003 onwards, when there was an increase in the account.
As a result, flat-rate and non-detail debits appeared, the former manager explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why the payments were not disclosed to the club in detail, the judge asked.
The association had not been interested in the financial arrangement in detail, important was only the debt-free, according to the answer.
In 2011, when an investigation into the abuse of office began, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club’s account.
These were reserves, the defendants said.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
“Why?” the judge asked.
For a long time, the respondent did not know the answer.
After all, he said he believed this was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The co-defendant was informed, the official justified himself.
This remittance was formulated as "damage compensation".
Why damages?, judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this wording because the club never suffered any harm.
But what do I do if the lawyer says, "You're all out of the tailor."
“Am I a lawyer?” he asked.
In addition, the official said he never received a penny of salary, he only charged mileage and diets.
He charged the club 1,000 euros per month for diets, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide accurate documents for the early years.
These were no longer retained after an operational audit in which everything was assessed as correct, they explained.
The second defendant had also received mileage.
All remedies had been made in cash, he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main trial will continue on September 23 with the interrogation of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts 30,000 jobs
In addition to the workforce reduction that has been going on for three years, the computer giant will cut further jobs when the company splits up.
The job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) find no end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This will save $2.7 billion in costs, the company said on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will occur from the fourth quarter onwards.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs over the past three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of fiscal year 2013/14, HP employed around 302,000 people.
Hewlett-Packard shares declined 2.3 percent.
The Palo Alto, California-based group that grew up with printers is currently splitting: The computer and printer business is to be bundled into a new company this year - separate from the more forward-looking areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A further disappointment in PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services have recently increased the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter ended July, sales of PCs and printers fell 11.5 percent.
Revenue fell by 8% to nearly $25.4 billion.
This decreased revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only reacted late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports anti-IS education mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly encounter rejection: 54 percent opposed it, 35 percent agreed.
That other states are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, 61% are positive.
24% are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
Collaboration with Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad rejected 51 percent of the respondents, while 20 percent were in favour.
29% were unable to decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
Until September 27, the trade fair will focus on connected, self-driving cars as well as electric mobility.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the theme "Mobility connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the Auto-Verband VDA expect about 900,000 visitors as they did two years ago.
Röszke: Violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water launchers at the Serbian border at Röszke against several hundred angry refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
Behind it a police line had formed and behind the policemen a water thrower was ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officers used pepper spray uninterruptedly.
The police then used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This dissolved the group.
The refugees have now retreated a little awaiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the area.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas were screaming.
Other refugees gathered together and suffered from shortness of breath.
Serbian police spokesmen were also injured by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world watches as the U.S. central bank meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates will be raised for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that just over half of those who thought the Fed would do so last week now think the Fed will stay a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero range and starting a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior associate at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust for an increase, but the signs indicate that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday
Death shooter at Delta State University left apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before shooting and killing his colleagues later on the day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was “sorry” about the first murder and wanted “he could do it undone,” officials said on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at around 10:00 on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency room employee that police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but that "no one will disturb" but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could reverse it.
I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he did not know of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously there was something in Mr Lamb's performance."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, officials said Tuesday there was “no information, no evidence” of a “triangular relationship.”
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they were married for about seven years, as a "good person".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground".
He said Prentiss was "absolutely best friends" with her daughter.
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been meeting Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them “he’s not going to jail.”
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the forest, and shot himself.
Lamb received a Ph.D. from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his life-sightedness indicates on the university’s website.
Stars who have lost their lucky bringer
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also allegedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this certainly takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group renovation.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
150 of the world’s approximately 1,000 executives will cost the workplace the Group’s renovation.
But there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is restructuring its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiaries Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation is to provide an earnings contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team led by Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr.
With the redesign, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
Until now, the organization of the 120,000-employee-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of annual revenue of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective bargaining conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed after the court-stopped strike on Thursday.
That was told by the union.
The topic of the talks will be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve viable results “within a year with a forecasted record result” as quickly as possible.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the background is the savings concept "Wings".
It stipulates that Lufthansa will outsource to the group’s low-cost line Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this will make the left defender cry and exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg infraction and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
"It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I’m not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he won’t play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the penalty penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw’s account read: “Thank you all for your messages. Words can’t describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I’m coming back stronger.”
Manchester United loses Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this type of injury leaves the place, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's hurting himself very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then if you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was impossible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
Talking to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it feels, I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows The Lorax better.
It’s one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won’t take long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister decided on The Lorax, Dr. Seuss's 1971 environmental fable.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: “fun, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book that I love to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or message that we’ve missed so far.”
All well and well, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reflects an indication of the contents of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.
"In the middle of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads.
As if that wasn’t suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax movie presented on the Internet Movie Database’s website and begins as follows: “In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of his girl, hopes to win over the Ted, the heart of Audrey.
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. Here an unnamed boy hears the local environment through the money-hungry, tree-cutting, thneed-knitting once-ler despite the protests of the namegiving Lorax, a squatting, mustache-like being, "who speaks in the name of the
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who didn’t read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron’s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron’s staff, but gave no further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the squad that England selected for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series loss is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out a win away.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting line-up, and the community spirit is strong; they won’t wear any 2012 scars, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth leaves the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks on Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best pickers.
Long ago, Lyth's run would have been extended, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully if he hits out more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not do so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test striker gets to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton had the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation that can be made was that England first deployed Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a punchman that I highly value.
He’s an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge spot, which hit us very badly.
He must get at least the same chances as before him, but this of course depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat alongside Cook, which would provide an extra-spin bowler and get four quicks, came up, and I don’t mind.
I don’t see why a punchman can’t beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he’s a devil of cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he’s a number 3 for them, and there’s no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his statistics — on average 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball — and think it’s a punch, but there’s not a large number of backup spinners that raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, who will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful dedication to the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the changing room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with what was said before.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the one-days, Root got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it.
Some won’t agree, but coaches and team builders don’t set the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with a light heart.
Brexit stock (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain influx if the economy is in a fluke by 2017
David Cameron’s unstable re-negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with each day, even without the choice of the ingenious Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn to lead Labour or the TUC, which is fiercely battling over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend said the other day that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is and not always their own fault, are fed up with Britain’s own agenda of divided concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they usually don’t want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it did not like it if it jeopardized social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they are winning allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes for an outward looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't let us be alone with France," Berlin says - lets see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or leave.
Germany’s prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with overly long perseverants such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is looking forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing.
It’s hard to imagine they’re going to pull a leg out to help the selfie brits whose energy should be better spent preventing Scotland’s exit from the UK — something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even be deliberately planning unhelpful remarks, all in the SNP style, during Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The re-negotiation was a bankruptcy" and "the UK won nothing of value from the re-negotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press baron, as they were not during the 1975 Tony Benn-inspired referendum that supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
You may remember Boris Johnson, the ore euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an “EU Straight Bananas” Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo-non-natives who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum whirlwind, because Blair had put the principle over the unenacted constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which thereby opened a back door for him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who gave me a friendly slap on my back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he no longer needs to waste time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott of Murdoch's strategy of the 1980s, a mistake back then and now.
It may take, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I kindly express it - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukipe’s traditional blue dye tendency and the wilder lands of Tory’s petty Englishism can probably say yes to that.
It’s what Hilary “A Benn but Not a Bennite” Benn said on radio and television this week as the scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn’s appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues on television without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But struggling to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his colleagues and MPs after all the reports at their closing session on Monday evening.
Whatever Corbyn’s heartfelt bottom-up image wants to convey – remember that he even touched me – news discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and above all in the social media turmoil, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s right not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that allows him to take Labour’s support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO -- Tom Watson is strongly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave -- foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of their bosses at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost cut by the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at Monday’s launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts Criticize Public Health England Report on E-Cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released the “Basic Report” last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy foundation" on which PHE justified its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims are “based on stone or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy.”
They said the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to lead their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the findings of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing directors are said to have previously received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 attendees at the meeting said he was receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was said to have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the panel are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s Tobacco Directorate.
The group’s research paper “significantly admits” that there is a lack of “hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria,” wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers” were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims had already been responded to in advance.
He said, “E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.”
One in two smokers dies from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die annually from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not risk-free, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfill our national jurisdiction.
BBC Should Give Up EastEnders, Says Former Head of Channel 4
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent through other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hardly controversial time windows against the most popular shows of its rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that for six years of his time on Channel 4 he had unsuccessfully tried to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that the BBC commissions or sends programs that would also be clearly shown by non-subsidized rivals," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the BBC's future.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don’t think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least make your production on programs that others don’t make or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: “I don’t see why a regressive tax program could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see what public television is supposed to be.
I don’t think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC’s most popular shows reflect what Sky’s former director Tony Ball suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public niche programs should "go to BBC4, where you can't measure the audience pretty much, but they're doing their jobs, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion in broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that nobody's seen."
They put her in a time window where no one ever wanted to see her.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Of course you all think, we all think you get a big value here for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the <0xC2><0xA3>150, ask me if this is true, because they don’t consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to “inform, train and entertain.”
He said little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it is 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should take the public broadcasters in Australia and Canada as an example to change this to "inform, enlighten and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Proms, which he said only a handful are shown on TV, and enter into alliances with the commercial channels to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' Can Control Brain Cells Through Sound Waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by eruptions of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The pulses work by turning on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses into the brains of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a Nature Communications report.
To create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The method has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which needs to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through tissue unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right at your doorstep!
The ads embarrass Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Exhibition Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle-breaking leg capsules!
Scatter bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause tormenting pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest weapon fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to launch weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters seen at bus stops and on subway trains that require a second look.
"Important announcement: will you take the DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademarks of the DLR line, which transforms into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will ride the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London, using “Ad Space Hack Packs,” a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of inbus keys claimed to “get access to about a third of the bus stop advertising spaces on the planet.”
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to go outside into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profitly with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was astonished at the silence that reigned around the advertising of the weapon fair - through an empty spot on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic dubious corporate advertising, but "by blowing in with bright colors and animation it stays stronger."
“They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be illegally traded outside our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapon fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed a U.S. military order on “the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder.”
This includes a "uniquely shaped combat head that delivers outstanding after-effects inside the target."
Whatever it does, it won’t be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student residence, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have angered - and the numerous, long-suffering complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The move into student dormitories ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It’s tempting to chat: people tell you where you came from, if and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you “honestly don’t love or hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like unlike those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Leave people.
People’s rooms often turn into drinks receptions, movie night venues, and communal meeting places, but they’re also the places where people get dressed and get their underwear straight.
Related: Don’t Remember to Start a Relationship at College
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student dormitories form a space-to-space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I’ve consumed to interact with you.”
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of socializing - and text him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my student dorms had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friendship by chewing.
As you start college at the peak of back mania, knocking on people’s doors to introduce yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the 1950s greeting “Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions.”
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel committed to chatting and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to stand asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, clawing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well?
Check this with the milk owner.
Chances are they say they serve themselves, even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that’s annoying, and you have my compassion — but try to deal with it more balancedly than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn’t make any noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the saying, you’re one of the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hall asked her neighbors if they would mind putting drum & bass a little quieter than it was at three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
Finally, when they stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two more hours before she let her own music quiver, shut her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally moved into the same student dormitory?
Conversely, wouldn’t it be deeply embarrassing if you held a roommate for your future spouse, pulled on her, parted again and then had to see her every day and maybe witness her pulling all of her common friends over to you?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to instill a little reason in your abdomen.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the boundary between a ulc and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments for it to become a boomerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and entertaining lesson about safety - but never spoil anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their door, and place their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not tack their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Semi-detached houses for refugees, single parents, low-earners
The real estate owner Markus Gildner builds semi-detached houses for people who don’t have much money in the middle of the Franconian corner valley.
So for example for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing space, but also the single mother and the low-earning."
"I show you how to build cheaply and well today," the 44-year-old said in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to quickly create affordable housing: he builds semi-detached houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here for a large part.
Given the flow of refugees, we will still need enough housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when people are housed in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that a lot of refugees will say it’s peace again, I’m going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What is the cost?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That is appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I have completed my project correctly in terms of construction law.
It always makes the impending Damokles sword special construction and the parking space regulation particularly complicated.
Scary.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is the place lacking.
Refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their townhouse project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don’t you intensify the competition for affordable homes?
Gildner: The truth is that in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany, but luxury apartments were built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message, even normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-earning.
I show you how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially worked on environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping on "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message stating that the "software update failed".
To get around the problem, users are advised to either wait for the rush to return or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process.
That might mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made it more unlikely by streamlining the update, and it will also be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could lead to a termination of the update.
iOS 9 Release Still on Schedule Despite WatchOS Delay in Reviewing iOS 9: The Least Exciting, But Best Update So Far of iOS 9: How to Prepare for the New iPhone Operating System

Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Volle Attacke".
Before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, the World Cup seconds stressed that "I have nothing more to lose".
53 points separate the vice-world champion ahead of the night race in Singapore on Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton.
The Brit has already won seven of the previous twelve season races and is also tackling the Floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will influence the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a mist bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has been in Bad Kissingen for the cure more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to accept chess players who are unable to pay the membership fee.
Youth work and the search for talent should also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" will be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa city.
District Office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined under the guise of the Social Foundation and opened a new point of contact at Graf Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to consultations, you can also attend courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, Graf Stauffenberg Square.
A new district office was recently opened.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and seekers receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of the health and nursing funds.
For years, we have found with our outpatient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone.
There are endless questions.
"Also, not infrequently many services are not used by the cash registers, because the complexity of the insurances is hardly understood," explained the new house owner Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapy treatment.
The offers of the Seniors Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Seniors' Center for Care and Care," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
Both CEOs see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre as a result of demographic change.
This makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration ceremonies, the district office is also devoted to segregation in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a great contribution to ensure that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and on Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm.
Bamberg vs. Würzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third league Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to refurbishment work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th October has now been set as the date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian football Totopoccal against the third league FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
It will be played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 19 o'clock at the Bamberg Fuchspark Stadium.
“We are glad that we now know when the game goes on stage, now we have planning certainty,” said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the ticket pre-sale that has now been launched.
It’s something special for our team to play against a third-party league.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams FC Eintracht Bamberg entered 2010 by victories with district league 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against regional league 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
The title defender is third league descendant SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the deans of Viennese architecture, has died.
He died on September 5, at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Shaping.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in Vienna’s Hofburg and to convert the Lobkowitz Palace into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Tim Wiese charges police officer with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has not noticed well in Bremen.
Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and engaged at Bremen and Hoffenheim, is now a wrestler.
According to his own statement, he has gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he did not.
Wiese was just getting his hair cut in downtown Bremen when he saw a parking space guard outside issuing a fine for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then rushed out of the business, insulting the officer and threw the due fine in front of her feet, as reported by the "Bild" newspaper.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under examination," said the city of Bremen.
It is only afterwards that it is decided whether the meadow will be displayed or not.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of the Isla del Rey are ideal for the growth of marijuana plants.
For the past three days, the Panamanian authorities have teared out the 4,500 plants and burned them.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters, according to the police, and urged them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft gas station.
Three people were also on the site of the gas station.
One of these men now screamed at the young man and struck him in the face with a fist.
The victim suffered a fracture of the nose legs and bled heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and calmed down on the racket, the racket first dismissed his victim.
The injured young man was now taken home by his friends.
The perpetrator chased the group with a car to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man walked outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the racketeer and another male person.
With the help of a stick, the victim’s face and thighs were beaten.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrators.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second bat is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to call 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller acquires Praxis Felstehausen and invests 310,000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann, Wirtschaftsförderin Uta Seim-Schwarz and Asendorf Mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased.
In many places in the countryside doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the Felstehausen practice on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still halfway to his successor in the coming months.
After a renovation phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests 310,000 euros in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and also wants to get into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the millers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was done, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees it as an advantage to be his own boss soon.
And so it was agreed that the millers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the double family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctor's offices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, was appointed as a senior emergency physician in the district of Diepholz in 2009 and volunteers in the DRC-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internalists, want to settle down as house doctors.
“The endoscopy is coming out,” says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations, as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a conversation room more.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
The millers receive a grant of a total of 50000 euros as part of a funding program from the county (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," emphasizes Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients are admitted to Felstehausen practice every quarter, and in North German average practice there are about 500.
In Asendorf there is another family doctor's practice.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller’s takeover of practice: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone.
By the way, those who visit Müller’s office hours continue to look above all in familiar faces: takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning force from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell ends an era in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen smiling.
She feels a little pain after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients often," says the intern.
Her husband laughingly adds: "We have a 6,000-square-meter plot."
“Until now, I’ve always been pushing myself into gardening, but now it could be different.”
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: “We are letting the refugees through”
"Now border controls are also being lifted at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
The controls at the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so “of course”.
The care and safety of people is at the forefront.
But it is also clear, "that it needs clear signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovene border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel further towards Austria and Germany and possibly also to build corridors for the refugees.
However, Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana did not see this.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will instead intensify monitoring of the border - especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area.
As the minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to block its borders for refugees.
“Every EU member must fulfil their commitments, otherwise the system will not work,” said Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia during the night hours on Tuesday, passing the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, since then, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Croatian Tovarnik.
It is predominantly about Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects about 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had hitherto brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade denied, however, that it was instructing people to take certain routes: “We cannot, nor do we want to,” it said.
According to media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, more buses were expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometers away.
“We heard that Hungary had entered, so the police told us to drive here,” one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually result in the already predicted shift of the Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a route slightly further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a heavy influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and EU partners have consistently testified to the country in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, around 300 refugees remain trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent the last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down early on Wednesday at a local sight in Horgos: he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, premature.
It would not be very high refugee numbers at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, the crossing of the border between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: in parts of the border area there are still minefields not cleared 20 years after the end of the Croatian War.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearers had been sent to the border region.
Hacker: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals accused of having repeatedly gained insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information obtained is said to have been used to make insider transactions in the financial markets.
In this way, according to investigators, a total of over $100 million was earned.
“Today’s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately being caught,” the SEC said in a statement.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around Mannheim’s Paradeplatz there is plenty of activity.
People do their groceries, partly quick steps, partly cozy strolling.
You control the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at the Paradeplatz.
Stop the city trams.
Pulsating, vibrant life with a splendid autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large panels each with the heading "Before I die I want to die"....
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid brought attention to its 20th anniversary and faces mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The Head of Ecumenical Hospice Assistance is available to passers-by for questions and conversations as well as the volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously grab the chalk and add the phrase "yes to my life", "can read", "drive with the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long", others stay short, read, say phrases like "as far as I am not yet" and then go on.
Again and again small discussions develop on the margins about the action itself, about life, how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
“Only if I realize that the end of this world will come to me at some point, I can live responsibly,” says the director of the Mannheim Diaconal Works, which together with the Caritas Association is the carrier of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, however, is understandable, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and dying is still taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening of people.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Confronted by personal experience with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to be involved in the relief of death.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid called for volunteers, it immediately contacted and was involved in its founding in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - accompanying affected persons and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Saint Vincent hospice.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid is well able to handle her task and the experiences and experiences she has gained.
“I see life from another wait, I think it’s precious and I appreciate the moment,” she says.
The outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and denomination-independent.
The financial support of health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations enables the training and further training and supervision of the death and grief companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be written down on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial outlook lowered for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supply giant lowered its year-long profit outlook due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the vacation.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it was making a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which are on average 4.9 percent and will take effect on January 4th, and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large parcels, which will be charged from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase year-on-year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company “rewards solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from the previous year.
The earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share that twelve analysts surveyed by Zack’s Investment Research predicted.
Revenue increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has caused sales in its Express shipping unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, ground transport revenues increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit posted higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $151.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting this year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduran Mahagoni table to decide whether it’s time to raise the lead rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening above them at one end of the ornate, two-story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests first.
The central bank has a double mandate from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to start off from the unprecedented incentive of the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economy’s data shows it is growing solidly, recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already cautious Fed representatives anxious to increase this volatility by raising interest rates on federal bonds – even if it is only a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed is going to do, which in itself is unsettling the financial market.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
The financial markets, however, expect a wait for the Fed, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy would maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would lift the rates at this point,” he said.
If she does, “they would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed, she expected a rate increase this year.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And while inflation was constantly below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world shrank at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May when investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For Fed representatives, market turmoil influences the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks had not occurred, they would be putting the reins on in this session,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed monetary authority has become the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “constrict” its monetary expansion sparked confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global asset management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that “the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that seem to be unrelated to economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which advocates an interest rate increase, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia prompted the Fed to cut its lead interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions “despite limited noticeable impact on U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where she's afraid of a rate hike because markets are upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, he is in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the aisles.
If the whole grocery store makes you hungry, there is a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the cash registers and has various take-away options.
What's here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even roast for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and bile, pig natural gut, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide gears are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
Providing you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support asylum seekers unselfishly in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She also enjoys teaching with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker's home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is very different from teaching in a proper school.
Brazil's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying to educate women in a shocking way about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by presenting images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects their babies’ genes and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipality council Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar installation.
The plans for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernrieder Sportgelände are progressing step by step: At the most recent municipal council meeting, the elaborated construction application was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the panel had decided, among other things, a request for a construction law "exception" or "exemption" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "satellite roof with non-middle first and roof overhang" is to be erected.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "Thus we get a wonderfully large south roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof inclination, which is supposed to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike what is prescribed in the development plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "exemption" was necessary because the construction plan does not allow "exceptions" regarding the roof inclination - whereby the Bernrieder Municipal Council usually acts rather restrictively in the case of liberation applications.
However, the construction of gyms is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The gymnasium construction at the Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are incurred in costs.
Grants are expected from school and sport promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the building application for the 18 x 36-metre hall is now submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of its staff move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is foreseen by the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district, which Landrat Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, a decision will be made by the Supervisory Board, which will meet next Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority were to move with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station to Schongau.
The rooms are available.
Employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiß.
Employees are informed of the plans.
The change triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the Medical Director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who should take over, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into the game, who agreed to take over from October 1 and change with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau this means in any case an "upgrade" and a widening of the offer in the area "Internal Medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
For the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will run both houses until next year the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018, when the currently ongoing renovation at Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landrat Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed rumors that the house, which is owned by the federal shortage, will be used in the future as accommodation for asylum-weavers.
As with the property, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there were several considerations.
Currently, there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come again," Fischer said of the quasi-movement to Lech, which had been received by the employees "positive and very understanding".
There was no real prospect for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the post of Medical Director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (once 100 beds) has repeatedly been threatened with closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar Lions are called tonight (20.15 am) at the Bergischen HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for pride.
Last season the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for there.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the opening on a cornfield near Pratau (county district Wittenberg), several hunters were on duty, as the police reported.
After a gunshot, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident happened was initially unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victim of violent crimes
A suspect has led police to the body of the missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
At the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenagers and throwing her body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old girl from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has been the victim of a violent crime.
The young woman’s body was found Tuesday night in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, the prosecutor’s office and police said on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old man, who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, confessed to the crime and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not returned home the evening before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen as agreed.
In search of the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal items of the victim.
In interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing finally revealed a suspicion of crime against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The detainee admitted during police interrogation that he killed the 16-year-old and placed the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the detainee on Wednesday, and the investigators blamed him for his murder.
Information about the circumstances of the act is intended to lead to further investigation.
Refugees need housing: study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overcrowded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable homes.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the association "Social Housing".
By way of comparison, this year 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
This means that 140,000 homes are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation.
Many then hit the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
The negative development of the housing market, however, is not only due to the rising refugee numbers.
The study also accounts for significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit that grows year after year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units are missing in the urban areas, says Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many working professionals therefore necessitated living in rooms in large cities.
Young adults stayed involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the fluctuation in the housing market.
In major cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
New incentives are to boost social housing again.
For example, the land acquisition tax could be waived and the property tax on subsidized apartments suspended temporarily.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The State Bank KfW’s support programme for refugee accommodations is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees freely escorted: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary, there is virtually no way out, as more and more refugees are choosing the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow the transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
The route is dangerous, however.
Croatia wants to agree with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a refugee corridor.
"I spoke with the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees departed for Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border near Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary closed its border for refugees.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: “You can pass through, and we are preparing for this opportunity.”
These people are there, it is women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who do not want to live in Croatia.
Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the Serbian border to the EU-neighbouring country Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most were from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
On the Croatian-Serb border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border strip carries other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine clearers are now to quickly create a safe passage.
After the closure of the border, hardly any more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police numbered 366 people arrested.
Just before the gates closed on Monday, there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a criminal offence.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings have therefore been initiated.
The convicts face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, there were still 40 refugees.
Practically, however, no one has any prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
In front of the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke workers began to clean up with it.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Barrier gratings were removed and one of the reception warehouses in the border area was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, Austria only reaches a few refugees.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants remained in the country, according to the government.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the direction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany on Sunday had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria because of the flow of refugees, it was over for them in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded people, together with two other helpers and their cars, over the border into the near Passau.
Previously, we first ate the unexpected guests, with lunch and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"This was a matter of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN talk.
You were very grateful.
One man couldn’t afford to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
“We were very pleased,” said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had moved on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau, in order to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic to Germany was stopped.
However, the regional train was stopped off the border at Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross
The bridge festival connected socially with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, the day before a two-bridge race sportingly - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending tens of thousands more to us is a logical result of hypocritical politics:
Rather than immediately assisting in the Röszke camp in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the haze of National Socialism.
Not only Austrians are suffering from this policy, but they are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to realize that the “promised country” that invited them and welcomed them is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, in the face of the ongoing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, to create decent conditions for people seeking protection.
And it will be an even bigger one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof neighbourhoods
Konrad's got his hands full with refugee housing.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight.
The government has deployed the former powerful Raiffeisen bank to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at the first reception centre in Traiskirchen has already been under control by Konrad.
“We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen,” he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also done without major vortices, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a “crisis situation”.
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
“But it’s not a barrel without ground,” Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the heads of state.
They had promised him to also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," Ferry Maier said.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places high expectations in the ORF action "Help as we do".
On the platform, private individuals can easily offer accommodation.
In addition, there are hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it could not be necessary for quarterers to maintain a certain height of the towel holders or size of the skylights.
For a limited period of time, “emergency standards” would have to apply.
Konrad justifies that he is more successful in accommodation, in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, with his experience.
I am an elderly lord who is not readily told untruth in the face.
Convincing power is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur costs to the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
His own neighborhood search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz calls for better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for housing refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, since it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in case of an emergency, other locations should be checked for their suitability.
The head of the city criticises the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to contribute.
Seehofer: "Borders are not locked"
In an extended phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Chief of State Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday the further action in the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders would not be locked.
Refugees can continue to travel to the Federal Republic.
However, there are now the appropriate border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" for Pühringer of the Germans' actions.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz industrial line has been officially completed.
The listed IT group S&T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, while the rest (2,700 square meters) is to be rented out to young, innovative technology companies.
“In IT, the smart minds are our raw material – and we have to try to make them work for us,” says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the New Shipyard and later also acquiring ones.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next runtastic is only a matter of time".
S&T has invested 1.7 million euros in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which each belongs to a third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the remaining 2700 square meters of space in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old Lia Peroni owner in the pigeon market arcade had to postpone this project briefly: Finally, she has now received growth in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, everything is now about women's handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously it was rebuilt for several weeks.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about whether I should open another store," Breit says.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also fascinated by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put into the cradle by her mother.
I do the best when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women are enchanted when they see a beautiful handbag, even the professional woman cannot answer with ultimate certainty.
Perhaps it is because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose residents are called whistleblowers.
Some of them are also associated with the billionaire who wants to become president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for agitators.
Whether he expresses himself xenophobic, tackles journalists harshly or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office is vigorously launching the campaign.
And cut it out well.
This is also registered in the Palatine town of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a term for many in the wine village on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place are related to him over ten corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it somehow exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstadter has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, which in addition to Trump also includes the Heinz ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for humility, also comes to the floor in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would surely be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the king of hearts.
While there is respect for the family’s performance, there is also a tendency to believe that Trump is “a bit of a big mouth,” Wendel says.
Randomly, the nickname that Kallstadt has in its vicinity was "Die Brulljesmacher" - too high German: the nickname, she says.
Trump is coming from the village of whistleblowers.
Trump’s success story began in 1885 when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold digger shop in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first land purchases in New York.
But the grandparents’ life was not free of tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not admit Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal immigrant.”
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken abusively about Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“Just like Poltert, that’s not as sympathetic,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump (“Grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz”).
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "he's always so busy."
Do you think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine that," said the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
Pensionist Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
“I can’t imagine that from Donald,” the 68-year-old said.
She would find it better if he didn’t win the election, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good”.
If those who had ruled the United States at the time of his grandfather had been like him, “he would never have arrived there at all.”
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
“It’s not my president,” she says.
“The grapes will be ripe even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 moviegoers, and interest is also aroused in the US.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice-President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountain climbing villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurry to Canberra to report following the loss of Liberal leadership, but it has not produced any major shifts in ratings for Today.
The Nine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This drawback of the distance didn’t seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers across the five capitals, compared to Today’s 339,000.
Today posted a slight increase over ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number fell short of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators at 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for checking out!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle with his two children off the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
Seven's X-Factor remained strong with 1,136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 spectators.
The second half-hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half-hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot-Seat averages 620,000.
The decrease in odds on the second night of The Chase Australia will vote Nine confident that Hot-Seat will ultimately prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for Million Dollar Minute that failed to overtake the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret Revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who will win The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor was enveloped in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will surely reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three became two, you may have accidentally given a hint of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until Thursday's final
All three women have lyrically ignored Wood’s sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, “If not you, who should get Wood’s last rose?”, their answers could become the game spoiler who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named Mackay – apart from themselves – as Wood’s best partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship from day one.
“From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarah’s) and Sam’s energies, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the whole of the show,” said Jeavons-Fellows.
“Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet, it’s so much fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week’s house visit made her clear that Wood could be “the one.”
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unreservedly set on him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., on Ten.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the U.S. - and there were many other teams sending inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game when he lost a fight like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punch return on Tuesday in the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a Punt return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by specialty team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his stale catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne hunts for a punch restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
“That was a thing that happens, you just care about the next game, and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the carver to his Origin debut in 2007, when a pass led to a try for Queensland in his own in-goal area.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian field with gun violence.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos seized and his democratic efforts stopped.
The Free voters are demanding the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee numbers.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn clause in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis in Bavaria’s schools when there are not enough new teachers for the many new students: “We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing,” Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise, we will get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The Free Electors’ Fraction of the Landtag will meet until Friday in the Lower Franconian Commune.
In fact, there were quite other main topics.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlap the exam," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN refugee protection zones in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.
“This is not how it goes, we have to find the causes,” the Free Voter chief said.
Refused asylum seekers want to deport free voters as soon as possible.
For this reason, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide."
"Bayern is pushing off, others aren't."
“We need to be more capable of action.”
However, state policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing focus remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has launched the pilot trial "Middle stage plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the middle school from three to four years is tested - as a result, it then takes another nine years to finish high school.
But Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The G9 issue needs to be accelerated," the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want to do so.
Free ride on the G9 wherever you want.
Wall Street helps Dax jump
The German stock market has closed with profits after a directionless and nervous trading history over long distances.
Only in the afternoon did a firmer start of the US stock exchanges provide for a clear direction, which ultimately pushed the Dax up by 0.56 percent to 10,188.13 points.
The MDax medium-sized gained 0.54 percent to 19,552.88 points.
Technology-intensive TecDax increased by 1.03% to 1,736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 as the leading euro zone index advanced by 1.01% to 3,207.60 points.
Solid profits also recorded the trading venues in London and Paris.
In the U.S., the Dow Jones index last recorded around 1 percent plus.
Many stock exchanges expect that the markets in the U.S. will be on the spot until after the interest rate decision and also the large decay on the futures exchanges on this Friday.
The discussion about the burdens of nuclear exit has meanwhile pushed the shares of RWE to a record low and also left deep traces at Eon.
According to "Spiegel" the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions.
The federal government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose by a further 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to one trader, a positive report from the U.S. investor magazine "Barron's" followed the weekend.
Accordingly, investors paid too little attention to the German chipmaker at the moment.
Investments in future-oriented wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold once again than in the previous year, as the industry association Acea announced at the launch of the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen’s advantages increased by 1.26 percent.
On the German bond market, the return on circulation of publicly traded federal securities fell to 0.48 percent (Friday: 0.50 percent).
The Rex Pension Index rose 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The federal future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
The price of the euro dropped last afternoon to $1,1262.
At noon, the European Central Bank set the reference price at $1,1305 (1,1268).
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
Violence broke out Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of whom threw stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired it into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, known to kill but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would diminish their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since the 10th.
Killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – an important step toward a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted on certain clauses in the Kathmandu draft constitution this week, and officials said the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mixture of commerce, business and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden intends to market a plot of land of around 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post youth centre.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of commerce, business and housing.
They are waiting for appropriate offers, it is said by the city.
Which investor is in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had bought a part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / Ecke Große Straße, already a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Little Sea near Emden are taking shape.
For the first time, the investor publicly presented plans for the project.
Many locals continue to be concerned - they fear the sale of their recreational refuge
For months, they had been negotiated, grumbled, debated and drawn behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from project critics and the FDP faction, who accused the investor and the administration of secret cramming, Ralf Behrends from the System-Bau-Management went on the offensive: "We don't have an answer to all the questions yet," he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The project, which costs between 10 and 12 million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Vigorous reactions among sea lodge owners who had come to the meeting evoked the images and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of seaside lodges and member of the board of directors at the representation of the interests of the locals, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant block that surpasses all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads to make this count," Schulz said.
What exactly happens on the good one-hectare area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a conclusive concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still lacking, the construction plans are still variable.
Twins at gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to see its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo dates back almost 50 years and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, the zoo says.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet fixed, as mother Dian has so far held them tightly on the body.
First, the "image" reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical hurricane over the next two days, Miami-based weather experts added.
Google Launches Double Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign aimed at raising $11 million to humanitarian organizations aiming to help thousands of refugees who have overrun European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google takes an unusually personal approach in announcing the donation call on its blog.
Rather than having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and anxiety,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally raised donations to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
“The mortality data take a long time to show something,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote a lead article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity operations have proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are pathologically obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain level of weight in terms of height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected since 2007 in a study, comparing two types of obesity surgery – gastric bypass and gastric tubular formation – to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained approximately equal in those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% completely resolved diabetes and 28% partially resolved.
In the medically treated group, diabetes resolved completely in only one percent and partially in only about two percent.
In addition, the results in controls of blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol were “generally better in the ‘surgical’ group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not decrease mortality in five years, according to senior researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastric rectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1 %), and more likely recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years — compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit to survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“That’s the critical point of this study because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group,” without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long for people to take this seriously,” she said.
"I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love story takes place in the Hunsrück
A young woman, unpopular and unpleasant at school, meets after years the swarm of her youth, and it falls in love with her.
This is also true of Luisa Binder’s recently published novel “We Are Not So Actually” by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrück readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument in her hometown.
"It's impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees’ home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not appropriate to the situation.
“It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and real development can be created, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries,” he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of violence.
“The use of violence has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attack, pointing out that the US violent response drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in children’s intake of hand disinfectants in the last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand disinfectant revenues among children under 12 years of age reported by poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are coming to these products more and more frequently, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants intentionally, while some do so to impress their friends or because of a trial of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scent, which are very appealing for children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It’s highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency call center at the University of Kansas hospital, Fox 4 station in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn’t let a sip of whiskey stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and if children get to it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four shots of strawberry-smelling hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was unable to leave when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors watched her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl fell through the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very frightening," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and store hand disinfectants out of the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York state planned to poison their "common" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished her from her room.
The police considered the thwarted plan a "gossip" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old car driver was slightly injured in an accident on the cross bracket between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross bracket towards the roundabout industrial area and realized too late that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
He then crashed into the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed the vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta.
The vehicles involved in the accident caused property damage of about 10,000 euros, the police informs.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.
Rumor: No Disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths downplays the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn it over again.
Hearts will fight SFA on Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be cautious on January new commitments that could destroy the squad's unity
Dons increase lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty shootout gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, so the Dons created a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which Griffiths spontaneously rejected, insisting that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don’t think we’re under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
You're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what they’re interested in.
There’s a lot of tension in the old-firm games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the loss to Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the loss to 10-man from Aberdeen followed, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad times before, and we'll come back."
Now we want to get out there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel that way, but we have to go on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton caution in January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new entries and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the Ibrox squad’s unity.
The former Brentford chief said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
The players coming in in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, in conversation with Celtic during the transfer period, has hinted that he could withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA battle due to Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's red card was later revoked - Collum's third red card, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains with what he said, insisting, "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
“It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment,” the striker said, adding, “It’s safe to say that I won’t return to Tynecastle unless it plays for Celtic Glasgow.”
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United's board of directors still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We’re going to get the guys back on track,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win Hamilton "unbeautiful".
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh straight league victory that earned them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues that have not won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising overall in the United Kingdom.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was higher than that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the course of the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scotland Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said, “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunken people disturbed the process.
Since the security personnel could not settle the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officers take the disturbers into custody.
An atemalcohol test scored 0.89 promilles in a 16-year-old.
The teenager was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promilles and was initially held in custody.
Why I Will Be Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t, I’ll be sitting in a spectator’s gallery in the Death Chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was already made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and since there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery is held to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to 5.
Whoever is chosen will watch it emotionally.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wants it, and you'll get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have made.
I do not want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of the murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I will see him die.
I can't say I'm really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to come out of Canning River after wet police chase
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to detain the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, just a few meters away from a police officer trying to “gently persuade him to return to the shore.”
Canning Vale police were summoned to a homebreaking incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
“He stood in the water and said ‘I’m not coming out, come and get me,’” said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiated".
“Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to escape an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted Racing Victoria’s stewards and integrity department, claiming they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s Late Scratching over a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt swab at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had stayed behind for 18 months over the espionage allegations and didn’t want it to “look like too high-hanging grapes.”
“I meant to say nothing about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that it all comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head raised, and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him employment in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing inside my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They seem to think I'm a cheater.
If that is the case, they should surely cling to their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Does the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps hold people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and reject me, and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it now.
But I have now reached the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unsuccessful master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
"One of my employees erroneously applied mud on his leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, whatever it was.
It was the same on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
“We all realize that we need rules, but here we’ve gone too far,” Moody said.
Man Arrested After Driver Escape
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia presented himself to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driver flight and neglect of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital and is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Beats Rivals Back for Claims to Ring Fight
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of tackling his players as the "agenda setting" of two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm players to “ring battles” with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely concealed remark to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, calling the game a "sample example" of the Rugby League, saying the two Queenslanders were not "too good" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackle limb and said they were focused only on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team gave him confidence, as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed our defensive system or techniques all year round, but in the last six weeks we’ve made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that’s brought us the trend shift.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It’s weird how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St. George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he's going to take a shitty care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a little worried about having to play against us.
“Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match Storm against Roosters scored a higher score than the match Broncos against Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are taking breaks and not points something exciting?
For me, these are the game schedules.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them in one phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-final at AAMI Park next Saturday night.
Serbia with $200,000 deposit after drug indictment
A man potentially facing a life sentence for trying to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released for a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Solay yacht that came from South America via Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape from Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 together to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two persons, it is clear that the requirement of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, on the condition that he gives his Australian and Serbian passports, checks with the police on a daily basis, and adheres to an exit ban from 18:00 to 06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: cab breaks apart
In an accident with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape to the left at the last moment, as the police informed.
The driver's cab was completely torn apart.
The driver was taken seriously injured to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o’clock.
Damage amounting to 122,000 euros was incurred.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone as she was asleep and logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
Police took care of it and looked at the five images, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered “relevant” web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would “lead to pedophiles on the internet” and he then “pretend to be a police officer to scare them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff’s Court: “He said it was an addiction, that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he drank, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty under the indictment to having taken indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, having violated the terms on January 25 of this year and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, since it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" was found in his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Smugglers flee small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the large-scale checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people more and more at smaller border crossings out of fear of discovery and arrest
On the Austrian side, a spokesman for the Federal Police said.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been taken in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to registration.
According to Bundespolizei (Bundespolizei) data, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich’s central station again compared to the start of the week on Wednesday.
By 8 a.m. alone, around 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Tropical storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart reported.
The strong low is the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry", which has been pulled over the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, winds of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour can be expected until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance circle.
On Friday, the sun can be seen again.
The crowd does it: Every two years the car manufacturers show their novelties at the IAA.
In 2015, there is mainly movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars in the compact class are currently particularly in demand: According to the German Federal Motorway Agency (KBA), about 28.1 percent of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected in the IAA (public days 17th to 27th September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new premium and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the dealerships in the autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the trade fair.
It is at the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is envisioning an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra comes with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
Hesse also offers other diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door.
The second variant will follow in the spring, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And what will be added to new compact cars besides the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is launching the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door in a conventional and an emphasised sporty GT version.
It will be sold at the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is brand new in the segment.
The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fully fits into the brand’s design line.
The basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newtonmeters (Nm).
Baleno will be launched in Europe in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën offshoot mainly put their hands on the front: here, the radiator grille was redesigned and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and Apple’s CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are added to the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has given the right to a former prisoner of the Tegel prison, who was housed in a cell that was too small for months.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can expect money even if they were only locked up in too narrow rooms for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
A former prisoner was thus successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel judiciary prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor area; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Afterwards, the man, who, according to his lawyer, is now on the free foot again, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His claim for imprisonment for the unworthy conditions of imprisonment against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges repealed the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case there for re-examination.
They see the man's dignity hurt.
The Court of Justice now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment were decisive for the compensation, there was a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, it would be to be feared that the legal protection of the personality would be diminished.”
The court must now clarify the amount of the compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they pledged damages to a prisoner for being locked up naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of humans.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday, which in a parallel case in November 2009 had certified an inhumane accommodation to a prisoner.
The plaintiff at that time spent between 15 and 21 hours a day in a cell of the same kind as in the Karlsruhe case for three months.
The Berlin prisons had also come in the headlines in recent weeks due to the lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even fights are said to have already occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the judiciary press office, 21 jobs are not filled in Tegel due to a shortage of young people, 19 are expected to disappear in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: 'We can do this'
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
About 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to receive one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do this".
What is happening in Germany is given in the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built (250000 apartments).
However, the lack of housing is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: 60,000 to 80,000 social housing units fall out of the rent price commitment each year, and for these particularly affordable housing units, refugees will also apply.
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
According to the Pestel Institute, this is far insufficient: 80,000 social housing units would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion dollars in funding for this.
Scientists and Federal Construction Minister agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there used to be a ban on asylum seekers for up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement, which restricts asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society, the majority - also due to the shortage of skilled workers - has established the view that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market faster.
A major barrier to accessing the labour market is the lack of German skills.
So far, there is not a sufficient offer of general and occupational language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
According to Thränhardt, the development of networks is therefore the Königsweg to labour integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to kindergartens, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is first of all very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokeswoman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of daycare, the administration distributes handouts in different languages.
If the need for female educators increases sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialized schools.
In the countries, students without German skills are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state bans asylum seekers or patience students - the only exception so far was Berlin, but Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his stance.
Refugees willing to study could be facilitated access to the university.
Refugees with a residence permit or allowance no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applicants’ Benefits Act when they begin a study.
The latter generally do not receive Bafög, as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to Bafög.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this span is shortened to 15 months.
But this funding gap must also be closed, demanded Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and further develop existing state-church law into a new state-religion ratio.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes professional care of newcomers.
Rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control possibilities.
This includes the willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, on Thursday expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to endure such conflicts in Germany "have immediately lost their right to live here, in Germany," he said in the Bavarian Radio.
He proposed that the Basic Law be translated into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be a much more important issue for the whole of society than it is today.
As a result, the majority society will have to change, the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more pressing.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for almost a decade.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention require Germany to do, must become a reality in the coming years, if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens use their possibilities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far, says doctor president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As far as manpower and capacities are concerned, we can do that,” he told the Daily Mirror.
However, additional money has to go into the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks to hand out health cards to all arrivals immediately upon registration.
Benefits provided could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided for by the Asylum Applicants’ Benefits Act.
Otherwise, doctors primarily create language barriers.
Even so far, according to the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde, migrants are less educated about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctor’s offices, interpreter costs would have to be covered, she demands.
But many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is about HIV education.
But with the partially other diseases, German doctors would come from their education, Montgomery says.
"Parasitic infestations or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect", and as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even have relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, some refugees are even doctors.
In order to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Bundespsychotherapeutenkammer (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by the TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rate and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe terrifyingness and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
To date, however, only 4% of mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, specialists or doctors who are not trained for the mental illnesses would usually decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misconceptions, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new staging "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract every age group to fascinating acrobatics, animal dresses and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the manege on the brick.
"Our passion is the circus."
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current manegen staging.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
The gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
“It’s important for us to take people away from their everyday lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” said the 27-year-old junior chief.
"Manegencocktail with Weltstadt-Flair", says director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometre tour can now experience this flair.
The circus’s program impresses with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with joke and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craftsmanship.
With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo wants to take it easy.
Lightness and agility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is meant to conquer women’s hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with a sense of fingertips and jointness.
Balancing on a ball with the single wheel?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated by its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
“The animals belong to our family,” Stephanie’s mother, Brigitte Probst, said.
Misconduct in the holding of circus animals is all too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst: “If our animals aren’t well, we aren’t well either.”
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every caress unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are lovingly called, are read from the eyes if possible every wish.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to maneuver.
The most important thing is to take good care of the animals.
Especially on their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra stallion, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," Brigitte Probst says.
Although the Zebroid is not yet ready for maneuvering, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
“One thing is certain,” says Stephanie Probst: “Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our hearts.”
The Circus Probst invites to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 and 8 pm.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 4 pm.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe gives false speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of the parliament was also clouded by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mugabe’s speech with shouts.
Last month, they had kicked him out and interrupted him during his speech on the nation's situation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their phones warning them not to disturb Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity in Parliament ends, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the company’s restructuring and savings efforts.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service business.
The expected job reduction will result in a burden of more than $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in transitioning to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for businesses,” the company said in a statement.
It splits a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical plants and whose Palo Alto Garage has called it "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this field, based on the belief that tightly focused companies are performing better.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger told Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is surely still uncertain.
The great disgrace with this current problem is that Wilshere had strongly ended last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's no big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere diseases since its debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight seasons since 2007/08, they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes an improvement in injury rate will continue during last season.
“Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident he will and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is setting up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little break,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to move on through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with his management.
“This drive is immense,” Wenger said.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I’m in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The Comedy Show That Gives Us Serious Lessons About Male Friendship
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common among men than among women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Man’s Year, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with “healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, vibrant and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can’t buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shone through interaction as a friend.
The humour of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of watching football in cozy armchairs, and Ross’ longing for Rachel – all came from knowing that men can definitely refer to it, even though they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
“My listening role for people who feel depressed and suicidal has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase “I’ll handle it” has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it’s perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria meets in his Champions League debut on Tuesday and helps PSG pass Malmö.
Here is the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on course as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Princes Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria made his debut less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League as a PSG player who kicked off the French champion, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a header goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only aim to qualify for the knockout rounds, but to improve on their way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and the club with which he started his illustrious career as early as 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so it’s a good start to win 2:0, to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed, even though there are certain things that we still need to perfect over the course of the season,” Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn’t score one or two more goals.”
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which managed to hold a 2:2 draw on his own against Bordeaux in the First League over the weekend, but he was knocked out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing striker was referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted why when he ran into Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmö's defense before finishing nicely in the long corner of the net past Johan Wiland.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would make a big win, they were disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, competed at Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed Kevin Trapp’s posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up on itself, with some mispasses and bad finishes, not least from Ibrahimovic, who patted in no less than five attempts alone in the first half and was then abandoned after Cavani had put him in after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his teammates into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot, which Wiland deflected past the post in the 52nd minute ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan thus scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic had caught a left flank of Maxwell.
That ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi was knocked out a goal in the end.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough.”
Hat off from Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, affected by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its huge debt repayment plan on Wednesday.
The London-based company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn pushes demand and devastatingly impacts markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore’s stock price to the head of the London Stock Exchange early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced the $2.5 billion share sale last week as part of the broader plans to pay off about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new holdings at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4% discount on Tuesday’s closing price.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term slowed growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official to Washington, will take place on September 25 and will respond to President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state diner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-Chinese cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also providing an opportunity for President Obama and President Xi to address areas of disagreement constructively,” the statement added.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on its way to Washington before continuing to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns regarding China’s alleged cyber espionage and its increasing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports car rented and driven to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in the district of Gotha you can fulfill the dream and once borrow and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
The same was true of a 29-year-old man from Gotha County.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was then over and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into the crawl on wet roads and drove into the board.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The property damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 move to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern were obviously close to the commitment of Spain’s superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times cup winners, four times champions league winners, two times club world champions, two times European champions, one time world champions – Xavi’s title list is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already before the 2008 EM before the farewell from Barcelona.
"I was told Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything back then, we won nothing," he says.
This was also recorded by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummeningge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over from FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
“Pep told me I wouldn’t change, he couldn’t imagine the team without me.
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season would have been with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, shut off the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and at the end celebrated the royal class triumph.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity, saying it was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night of HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when it emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
“If we’re talking about diversity, then do it with the cast of the movie and not with the cast of the show,” Damon said.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted disbelief, and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay" as the actor's comments from The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
“I want to ask people to think about – whoever the director will be – how they treat the character of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she's a bitch beaten by her white pimp.
Dear White People’s producer advocated for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing rights to the film; Damon replied that their directing “may ultimately give us something we don’t want.”
After the discussion aired, social media exploded with disapproval of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing, "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement made a nationwide impact, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the Grammy Award-nominated release of the albums of the year.
"Albums still matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
Recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which was just completing its seventh season, had never experienced a contestant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task included climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first athlete to complete the exhausting Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock over winning the $1 million grand prize.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about, I’ve never earned more than $10,000 or had to live,” Isaac E! said of his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
“If there’s more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and how much life changes, he receives the great gratification.
I don’t think he has any resentment for it.
He is so happy to have done what he did.
Masses of awards he received from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers pass Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season wasn't particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Once they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that was so hard to grasp for much of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun no matter how they come,” said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) beat 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year very much," Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and so I want to concentrate on the game.
The designated tiger-hitter Victor Martinez had three goals and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the lumber well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in the (beat training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs in the back at the end of the seventh inning, the twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colorful, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overcame Mauer, the only man he faced, in front of designated rookie beater Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run from right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the finish run in the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th Major League leader this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall created an RBI double against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon, scoring 5-4.
However, the right-hander Sano scored three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a still unmovable Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injured list before the game after missing more than a month due to back pain.
“Obviously not the start I wished for,” Hughes said, “but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I was going to make some pretty good pitches in the third inning.”
After receiving the leadoff battery in the first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" in the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers picked up in the second, scoring a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by centerfielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by reliever right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez left due to an injury to the shoulder.
It is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez’s shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder distortion, is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 in four Tigers starts since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 because of a distortion in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people traveling there will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced Tuesday evening.
It expected 450 to 750 incoming refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the Gießen government presidency responsible for the first reception, 7,500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German involvement in Syria to be a possibility.
“I believe that decisive reflection on military options cannot take place without Germany,” he said.
He accused the European states of “collectively looking away”.
Four years ago, one was glad that the cup of military involvement had passed to Germany.
"Now the conflict is crashing in front of our doorstep," he said in Germany radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told Austrian television station ORF on Tuesday evening that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Nor did Germany send refugees back to Austria.
“No, it’s agreed,” she explained.
On the question of an agreement according to which Germany could receive a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks in this regard between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria from Hungary via the so-called Balkan route.
Their goal is usually Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany began with temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22), EU interior ministers are expected to take a new approach to the mandatory distribution of another 120,000 refugees.
Given the strong refugee demand in Germany, the federal government wants to support the countries more strongly in the first reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after nearly four hours of discussions with the prime ministers at the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection would get it too.
But those who do not have a prospect of staying can not stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared during the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "huge effort of force".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now trapped on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometre-long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also lock the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking dodging routes over Romania, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said of the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had crossed the fence.
According to eyewitness reports, thousands of other migrants made their way to the Greek border in Turkey.
Cassini finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice armor of the Saturn moon Enceladus, a global ocean floats.
This is concluded by researchers from observations of the Cassini spacecraft.
Thus, the moon roams slightly in its orbit around the ring planet.
While this tumbling movement is only small, it is still too large for a permanently solid celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water beneath the ice sheet of Enceladus.
As early as 2006, Cassini had discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of the Saturn moon that spew water vapour and ice particles, thus feeding the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to give up about a month of offensive actor Valdet Rama.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had already complained about pain earlier this week.
According to Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of forced break".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a great loss."
"Of course we have to think now," sports director Necat Aygün told the "Bild" newspaper with a view to the potential commitment of a non-uniform professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously contracted with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his ability".
Goalkeeper Rubin Okotie is able to return to team training after his concussion next week.
The Austrian national team is scheduled to start running training on Thursday.
Okotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a fierce clash on the head.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slim line is often discouraged by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. But above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta carotene.
Who eats the fruits thus supports vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly.
The shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they naturally taste pure or in sweet foods.
But a mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a Mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
UPS is hiring up to 95,000 extras for the Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are wanted.
Already last year, UPS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95,000 extras.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making precautions since last year to be ready for the Christmas business.
In 2013, delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to parcel services.
First drying storm, then striking cold front
Next night, the dryer breaks into the valleys of the north side of the Alps, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and at night to Thursday, the hairdryer blows partly with storm strength through the hairdryer valleys.
After drying on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, which brings heavy rains, wind gusts and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a news release, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a vigorous southwestern current.
On the north side of the Alps, the hair dryer breaks through the valleys at night to Wednesday.
As a result, the dryer blows until Thursday morning in the dryer valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km / h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland partly also at over 100 km / h.
The hair dryer can in some places penetrate into the adjoining middle country, and on the mountains, even storm gusts of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryers ensure summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the south alpine slope begins to accumulate.
This is where the rain starts, which lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, south of the Alps, over the next 48 hours, some of the rain will have to be over 100 litres per square metre, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning the air runs out of the hair dryer, after which a cold front with heavy rain, partly thunderstorms, rolls from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind is fresh to stormy, and the temperatures are decreasing significantly.
The following days present in the north autumn at 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south at the weekend it becomes sunnier and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless square in the park on Oppio Hill was named in the name of the German reformer on Wednesday.
At the "Piazza Martin Luther" he is now recognized as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name had been requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes for centuries as a minority could often live their faith only in secret.
The square makes it visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcomed in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for a few months as a young Augustinian monk around the turn of the year 1510/11.
At that time, he saw the city as a degenerate sin-babel.
His negative impressions, according to historians, may have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the trade in abductions.
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative forms has been preserved by the 75-year-old - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: tailored to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
About three years Otmar Alt has been working on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of all books".
Cycles have emerged that focus on topics such as the Way of the Cross, Plagues, Commandments or Our Father.
With this, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its emphasis on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the scriptures selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into the present, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quotation by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrhuter Order.
“That’s when education happened with the cane,” recalls Otmar Alt.
“I have tried to work this out so that I may be able to get along with the Lord the Father again.”
His second concern was to bring art back to greater importance in fast-paced times: "The perception of picture worlds today is marked by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is displaced.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to let themselves "fall in" into the images, let them act on themselves, discover and feel what power they have: "The image seeks its opposite".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung that he was "always" a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his paintings".
Old did not care to fully grasp the Bible, but chose the topics that mattered to him, even mysterious ones.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," Altepost says: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains."
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deep your life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s paintings speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open on 15 November at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX track nears
Plans were made, space was found, companies were commissioned, hills were modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BMX train, it was over again.
Failures in politics and administration caused distress, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hills deported, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First Municipal Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock has now announced in the Children and Youth Committee.
“I hope that something visible will happen this year,” she said.
The work at the former indoor swimming pool should then be started without "another memorial break".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga is sending a clear signal at the weekend.
Football reacts to the growing situation in Germany and guarantees its help to the politicians in dealing with the problems ahead.
“I think that’s the biggest challenge our country has faced since reunification.”
"In principle, no one can say that it's not my business, I have nothing to do with it."
“This has to be of interest to each and every one of us to get this issue under control,” said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Ms. Özo<0xC4><0x9F>uz and the Chancellor there."
"The issue will surely play a central role," he said.
Football can and will help.
But the decisive course must be taken by politics.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
“Through the Egidius Brown Foundation, we have ensured that this program continues until 2019,” Niersbach said on the sidelines of the UEFA conference in St. Julian’s/Malta.
Some Bundesliga players also support this program.
Already this weekend the 36 professional clubs will put a clear sign when they will wear on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes) the imprint "Wir helfen - #refugeeswelcome".
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusen sports chief Rudi Völler told Bild-Zeitung (Tuesday) and described the project as "obviously".
"The refugee drama is for everyone, no one is allowed to look away."
"We football leagues can, no, we must use our radiance, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim’s CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a “prominent sign of the league.”
The women’s national team is inviting 100 refugees to the European Qualifying Championship against Hungary on Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great joint work of German football".
The fact that all 36 license clubs started their own projects in their places is great.
It is just as great that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.
“This is of enormous importance,” he said.
In this and next year, the association, together with the DFB election and the federal government, will each make €300,000 available for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software company, Bill McDermott, reportedly lost his left eye after a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the United States, he fell after midnight on a water glass that he had worn in his left hand, reports the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He was almost bleeding, passed out, then dragged himself out on the street - that's what he told us last week," said Hasso Plattner, co-founder of SAP.
McDermott could do his job.
“In early October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf,” Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday issue) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full for SAP, full in my job."
“Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner, all the time,” McDermott told SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important to him to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Anyone can happen like this."
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen."
McLaren Replacement Pilot Magnussen Out of Battle
Magnussen tweeted a photo and said he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore not eligible for the weekend night race in Singapore as a reserve driver for the two main drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Soccer: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down.
The national player will also be missing the leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7 p.m./sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot resort to him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be there again in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return of him to training on Friday".
Faced with the high burden of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribal eleven on the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He's training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, Tuchel did not know whether Weidenfeller will be used in all European League games in the future.
He is also likely to play the second game.
The research statement of fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, considers midfielder Julian Weigl understandable: "This is not Marco so wrong."
“I think we have a good chance of taking the title.”
Robotic cars: Government wants to lead Germany
According to the will of the Federal Government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the IAA car show of a "new age of mobility".
Automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and reduce traffic congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being built on the Highway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to ensure that the driver "does not have to be burdened with additional liability risks", the federal government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to raise the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to push for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020.
However, driverless vehicles are to be expected on public roads "only far after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site is estimated by the authors of the study by 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD traffic policymaker Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability for accidents and the security of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, German self-driving cars still look skeptical - much more so than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organisation Dekra, published on Wednesday, concluded that only 8% of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32% expect it in 20 years, 31% do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars to be used by 2025, while in the United States 33 percent.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital federation Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to surrender control throughout the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway, 15 percent of traffic flows, 45 percent in traffic jams.
Almost one in four would not leave the car in control under any circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis EM
According to the current stand, the Dusseldorfer only wants to beat individually at the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is due no later than 22 September.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
"The boys found out in the morning."
“But we are strong enough to win the title without Timo,” said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight to China for a long-term sponsorship.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo the disadvantage is, we are no longer such a clear favorite," European single champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov said.
The Hamelner, who leads the setlist in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 EM in Schwechat.
"Timo was also missing at the time, and we became European champions."
“This is what we should do,” the World Rankings Fifth said.
Manchester United national football player Luke Shaw has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated that the 20-year-old player of Bastian Schweinsteiger had a shin bone fracture.
Gaultier feels too old for a terrible child
It’s a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figurine cabinet: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: showcase dolls that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and with that he put men in skirts.
“I can’t say today that I’m the terrible child of haute couture because I have white hair.”
“It was bleached before, but now it’s real,” Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which will be on view from September 18th in the Art Hall of the Hypo-Culture Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially rejective stance to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me an exhibition sounded a little bit like death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made in Montreal, Canada and Paris station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly overlookable work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training.
The show is not chronologically constructed, but it is an excellent choreographed overall work of art, for which a lot of effort was made: to freeze the dolls, for example, a stylist was hired specifically.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material have been transported to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was another special delicacy: a leather pants outfit with corset.
- Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women (“Women are smarter than men”) and people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer’s first, timid fashion attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football) he put on his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll wouldn't have been allowed by his parents.
He later taught himself to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
I bought them later, of course.
For his first fashion show, he couldn’t pay the models.
They didn’t get anything, but they were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewelry instead of gardine - Plauener lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were all about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were created in large quantities for customers, who processed them further, for example, to blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the fashion company Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze fashion played a greater role, was then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which draws on past style epochs, creates an increasing potential for ordering.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Fashionspitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitze and Embroidery Industry Association together with nine other companies.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have fallen.
Private specialist shops and also wholesale shops almost no longer exist.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Nowadays, mass goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and almost exclusively distributed via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and to the USA.
Sufficient reasons for new paths.
The industry association also tries to score through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the embroidery pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg office of the West Saxon University of Applied Arts Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often varied only slightly to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak.
The machine embroiders small balls in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krausse was inspired by this: "Previously I could not do anything with traditional Plauen tip".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it embosses the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a memorabilia.
With this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plans new ‘Mary Poppins’ movie
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney is still daring to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not a remake, but a kind of sequel that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the nanny’s experiences with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy to the world more broadly
The economy needs to open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group tasked with steering the reform.
“China should work to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve strategies for business start-ups,” he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for Deepening a Comprehensive Reform.
Promoting new startups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list on regulating market access, relaxing border control policies, encouraging state enterprises (SOEs), acquiring private capital, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important as it assigns a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls over the powers given to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up government-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened up for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "green card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their duties and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.
EU to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission intends to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fishes and thus suggest a significantly higher dose of nerve poison for consumers.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, sharply criticized the plans: "The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of nerve toxins for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish are to be raised from one milligram of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that, on the basis of the limits still in force, about 50 percent of the catches cannot be sold.
After doubling the limits, only 14.5 percent would be unavailable.
In return for this easing, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
But Foodwatch called this a "trick" because smaller peace fish, such as carp, are usually loaded so low that they already meet the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction maneuver, which alone helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans and is heavily enriched through the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn children".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares on its homepage in view of the current maximum values that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through coal combustion.
German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written report from the Federal Ministry of the Environment to the Greens parliamentarian Annalena Baerbock.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, has been "permanently and extensively exceeded", the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, European-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most common health risks reported in the EU’s RASFF warning system.
