Inflation in Europe has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to rapid increases in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, the European Community's Bureau of Statistics in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts showed only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the governing interest rate by saying that declining interest rates, along with rising commodity prices and declining unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, this is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter inflation" so that we do not have to intervene on this issue at a later time.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record in the last twelve years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to rapid increases in food and energy prices.
Grain futures market odds have increased by 88 percent and the price of soybeans has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also rose considerably in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose by 52 percent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 percent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the inflation rate over 12 months remains around 3 percent, however, over the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut the governing rate twice in 2008.
Gallup warns of government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Youth Democrats Alliance) increased significantly at the beginning of December, for example, since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never seen such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, more than two-thirds (71 percent) support against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Hungarian Democrats’ Forum) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrats’ Alliance) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
Of some loyal voters going to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate from the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly serious has never been so high, it is 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects a worsening and only one-tenth expects an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of people surveyed, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, said the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of changing the political situation is the proportion of society that thinks discontent with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the October riots, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, today this rate is only 20 per cent, and the relative majority (33 per cent) believe that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of voting intention, 60 percent of respondents answered that they would certainly vote and the additional 20 percent said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent would likely participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would be unquestionable.
74 per cent of people would say no to higher education enrolment fees, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 per cent would say no to hospital expenses.
When we look at only the same proportions among the people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital fees, respectively.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has raised its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets located in the Budaörs commercial triangle maintained last year’s average price increase of 16 percent, with the difference that this year’s VAT rate has not risen.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the Budaörs commercial triangle, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by 16 percent on average, with a value increase of well over a thousand forints in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already flown" in major food stores in December, have no longer increased sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily shopping basket in the hypermarkets surveyed has exceeded the psychological threshold of at least 91 forints, at least ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this figure was 6,800 forints.)
Unicum and live fish prices have remained almost at last year's level, but turkey, walnut and poppy net prices have risen sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics), but at Auchan, one kilogram of bread was found at only 139 forints.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was astonishing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the record bottle of two liters of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the record bottle included.
However, this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of his Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
When comparing last year’s most expensive basket and this year’s cheapest basket, we see a 12 percent gap while the difference between last year’s cheapest basket and this year’s most expensive basket is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticeable in last year's Christmas prices.
This process puzzled trade, as hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply on products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, they risk losing a big profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the value of 2006 while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and the lowest prices increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By bringing the two Christmas seasons closer together, we saw a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer items increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH's data: for some basic foods, the Institute of Statistics found a price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to make the sharp rise in prices also accepted by multinationals.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-storage foods in pallets.
On Wednesday morning, major queues formed at the cash registers of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased abruptly.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less significant in the province, many multinationals complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer items.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief doctor of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also make savings on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected in a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured man in a serious car accident was removed from the hospital but soon after he had to return due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have been unable to perform a major operation because of the bacteria found in his body.
Until December 10 of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multidrug-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National nosocomial surveillance system, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Namely, it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a bacterium well resistant to antibiotics that will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, in elderly patients, with low weight or with a weakened body.
According to János Hospital Principal Doctor, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
We must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only where we are not looking for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the caregivers put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however infection can not always be prevented.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favorable to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and seniors' homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these exams.
Most cases only emerge if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines also for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient care and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical staff.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks, but important gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by droplet inhalation and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the contaminated patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, save on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable way or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government Project Against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA is an exorbitant expense for social security funds, which is why it is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified as one of its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, who had caused a fatal accident, was not drunk.
The official finding of the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd Arrondissement has been drawn up.
It can be ruled out that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has since resigned from his post, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, said Friday Attila Morvai, a spokeswoman for the public prosecution of the capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation that already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the police station of the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in Kossuth Lajos street of the 22nd arrondissement.
(In fact, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and applied for retirement because, according to the police communication, the accident greatly upset him.
The investigation into this case is conducted by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the outset with the magistrates tasked with conducting the investigation.
€400 million more for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on a €400 million credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties to a credit agreement of EUR 100 million. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million appropriation agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, with the remaining EUR 150 million to be used later following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project of metro line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-discuss possible changes to the initial contract when Hungary has finalized details of the metro’s financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and no commitment fee.
Bulgaria, a paradise for the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market which is still the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most fashionable target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albéna, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the area of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, with shops and office spaces promising the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors already buy in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are looking at the same time to change their life, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the edge of the Black Sea and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle down buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old decayed houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria has been listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium- or long-term gains.
The price of buildings in the capital is constantly rising due to increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian 6 per cent
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals end on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians arriving from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, intensive discussions are under way between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not want to discuss exact figures, although it was willing to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent from the 1990 level by 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need, excluding emissions reductions.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors likely under the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), said Piac és Profit (Market and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU’s ambition to maintain its role as flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent before 2020 from the level reached in 1990, regardless of the successful signing of the "post-2012 agreement", and is prepared to reduce them by up to 30 percent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries are also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibility and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries to the Kyoto Protocol had aimed at a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all the 15 EU members of that time made the commitment to 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent from the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, the press release of the Ministry of the Environment recalls.
The stake is big in Bali because the long-term international climate agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which the new IPCC has emphasized.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and an increase in Earth’s average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
The British military units communicate, on the video-sharing site, recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of becoming popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that became passionate about YouTube: special units intervening in Afghanistan upload video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the Air Force Operations headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London where compatriots upload them on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" was watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as the "defenseheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and broadcasts videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the air force's original objective, the videos were posted on the net to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make the general public aware of the actual objectives of the army's presence abroad.
Propaganda published in this way costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment ads on television, according to BBC Defence Consultant Gordon Mackenzie, but it also inevitably carries a political message as it justifies in a special form the merits of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game.
The army is annoyed because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have been passed on the sharing site which also show, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been posted on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were made in real mission, but the British military has only recently been proud of the uploading of these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently by using the free downloadable America's Army shooting game. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and donuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a weekend meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is entertained.
The public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year’s biggest Christmas party will be hosted by the Ministry of Defence, but it will not be invited by the Ministry’s employees.
On Christmas, orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The department is planning a budget of 25 million forints to create the year-end atmosphere.
In comparison with the other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees roughly, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the National Justice Council (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
Renting the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party which is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company that manages the tenders.
The building of the Theatre de la Ga<0xC3><0xAE>té was rented for this purpose.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to reach the person responsible.
Costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, hosted a ball for St. Lucia on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the welcome words of the minister and the dinner was followed by a dance party on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening dress was not mandatory at all at this ball.
The ministries of health, labour and local communities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will host a show and party to its employees, within its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited for coffee and donuts, the press service said, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will simply invite his staff to have a drink in the Ministry of Local Authorities and Land Planning's room.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will host a Christmas party in its large hall, which is expected to host 436 employees.
It expects to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees have celebrated Christmas in the same way every year.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the presentation of the minister but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, Christmas will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, held annually, are started by a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not celebrating Christmas at all, the respective press services told [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The mega strike forces are gathering
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form, on Friday, their strike commission, which will be responsible for coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Funds Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams because the rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The League Unions will announce, on Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protests will be held and, starting on Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the Health Funds Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Funds Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide what action to take.
According to the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is likely that the vote on the Health Funds Act will not take place until late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic jams are planned: railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning some of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies risk being stopped.
At the same time, in different parts of the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strikes, the list of these is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organisations report striking for an indefinite period of time, while others have declared a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the M<0xC3><0x81>V (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) have not managed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but, as Christmas approaches, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest public transport will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest airport between 7 am and 9 am, the League Industrial Electricity and Thermal Energy Unions will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union called to strike for 2 hours and 2 hours respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Union of Health and Social Sector Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new retirement calculation method to be implemented from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in the case of retirement before the legal age, that would allow to transfer into the system the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the League Trade Unions, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increased Country Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
In its "risk warning", the company points out that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the exacerbation of the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsies and non-Gypsies in Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's policy strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: “public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma affair to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who have based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians”.
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely to occur, they say.
According to the research institute, due to the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following increased publicity on the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007, calling themselves the "national self-defense association".
“The common feature of these rallies is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their members for defence missions (catastrophes, national defense, defence of order), armies if necessary, in addition, by referring to the inadequacy of the police, the army, in other words the state,” they added.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method that, based on the resentment of the society of politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions from a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civil character and association status therefore serves only to avoid the legal pitfalls of the registration of these associations in court, but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbouring relations.
In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultranationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma riots that erupted in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the UNB decided to establish a guard, saying that the objective of the organization is “national self-defense”.
According to them, in the last 17 years, the gypsies have “terrorized” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, the Political Capital recalls.
They added that the initiative had sparked vivid debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration by some Bulgarian Roma organisations regarding the establishment of their own guard as resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not rule out that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, the risk warning of Political Capital reads.
At the request of the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they will inform public opinion, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and in the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the New Year's Eve can rest quietly.
In a year, we have eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national day, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, as is October 23, which is the commemorative day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1st is Labor Day and on November 1st and 2nd we remember the members of our family and our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to rearrange working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the festival marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been adjudicating in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and all their employees employed, public servants and persons working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, institutions running without interruption and in service, because of their vocation, and also to days of rest.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because, according to experiences, the majority of people rather overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in the level of working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be rearranged for the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25 will be a working day to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for October 23: Saturday, October 18 will be a working day replacing Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can terribly bother colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that “beautify” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether one gets used to these problems or takes up the challenge and consciously avoids ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department,” one colleague told you.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, this is arranged with apologies.
Before having painful explanations, it is worth thinking about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, or they're right to be angry with you for stealing their good.
Do not bring back envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and you need them right away.
Are you chatting about the privacy of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop gossip spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his or her intimate secrets with you, don’t abuse his or her confidence!
Bury the shared information in yourself and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you saying you're sick for no reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel sick or feel you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your future missions must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won’t go to work or that something might happen that would force you to stay at home, don’t forget to let your boss and colleagues know so they won’t be surprised at your absence the next day.
Roaring, scoffing, phone
You dive into your work but the scoffing of your colleagues suddenly rips you off?
Did you become, unwittingly, a witness of a phone conversation that you would have better not listened to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with humming, chanting, talking out loud (whatever you’re leading over their heads), kicking feet, rude words, or dissatisfaction expressed out loud.
They can bother even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing others of a mistake?
If your work is not done by the deadline, you forget to send an important mail or message, do not charge anyone for this forgetfulness!
Don’t put it on account of possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you’ve made a mistake and if it’s inconvenient for others, fix it!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix the negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Putting on jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Don’t put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be overlooked, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you are no longer interesting
Slowly move into the usual morning plug.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm putting up the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones all in time, then a female choir joins it like a real gem.
Mr2 broadcasts the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
Hungarian music life has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground are gradually beginning to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in Yonderboi’s group before he set out on his own path, perhaps because “there is no room for two feet in the same shoe”.
His project (Zagar) and music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance and pop music, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török.
Formation initially playing in small clubs began to become known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine cited their first album from 2002 among the 50 most important records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would be as competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble became undoubtedly “trendy” but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted appropriately and released a new and better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new avenues for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line of the former group of Pécs of Balázs Zságer.
We are well there with the reference to the flight but next to the aerial music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the album's debut at the Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is fine (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: did your music really stay a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music targeting a certain layer doesn’t tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
A good pop song can be honest as well.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only young people in their tens or twenties but also the older ones.
They follow the changes in light music much more closely as they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in who or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously happy to see that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal, but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important in concerts where mutual influence is already working, but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you wouldn't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Will you follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and had a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Rather, we’re team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it roll out.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his band and take another path.
hvg.hu: On mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi’s record, Wings of Love is in the top spot.
Many have heard Zagar’s name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you have consciously opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We have not planned to make a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus the six-member choir was composed, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This track had been around for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we wrote the album, we thought something was still missing from that song.
The string of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the melody the girls learned later that night.
I got it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don’t have a single role, they all sing together and they don’t sing louder than the music, so the music doesn’t just accompany their singing.
They were behind the scenes, too.
Is it wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego a little bit, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none as to the musical creation process, we had more difficult tracks when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I'm playing a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, it all set up like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already "leaved" this record.
At the moment, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous trader risked billions because of its inferiority complex
A concealed fraudster.
His former employee, the French giant, is the Société générale, owner of the Czech bank Komer<0xC4><0x8D>ní banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot in any way be considered incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized in time the crisis of the US mortgage market.
"He's fragile," his superiors suggested, who reported him to the police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's testimony reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a profit of 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis is beyond the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income customers or those who had encountered repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I had won my first half a billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel said, adding that he had, of course, kept nothing for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed to having misrepresented the reports in order not to be screened.
He succeeded in deceiving his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who does not risk nothing has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
No, I don't.
"I estimated that just getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to take such a big risk come from?
He only came to his position gradually.
He began working at Société Générale in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trade assistant and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
But he knew he would never make as much money as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less respected than the others.
In terms of my university curriculum and my professional and personal background," Kerviel told investigators.
Shortly after his inauguration, he achieved his first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the drop in this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
“It was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they were in doubt.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
This is when the start of the year comes.
He lost a billion euros in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he gets to work, he is no longer an employee of the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became suspicious because of his leave.
“Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will go to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest share, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Businesses should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research into industry, but also for the introduction of new and more effective management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been one of the least successful recipients of EU funds among the new members.
The Tribunal upheld the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former president of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for former Nicaraguan president Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released and was living under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again is currently unclear, according to the AP agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, or they will let Germany finish her sentence at home, or go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that German regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictitious companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that German had created to fund his election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted
That's the way it is.
The state budget was adopted.
Why is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the turbulent debate before the vote on the declaration of mistrust of the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The House of Representatives passed this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, though hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more media attractive and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
The arguments of politicians are much more of an interest to opinion than to abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is not capable of paying at once:
The first is the significant share in the costs of mandates imposed by the law, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" bringing together the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle, however, is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest hazard.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often emitted bonds, overly indebted their municipalities, in order to obtain new sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits.
In past years, they succeeded in repaying these debts through the mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, especially those of energy, obtained from the state as part of the privatizations.
Today, they no longer have that source.
If only official and verifiable facts are observed, it is found that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, just like the rest of the world, and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is sure to finish it.
This was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they indebted the state more and more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have handled their affairs in a much more reasonable manner than our republic.
This is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, globally, are least threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programmes which have unfortunately swollen up unnecessarily in recent years.
Although we have managed to eliminate some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections, if a lag in the retirement age limit, as well as reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and anyone in power will only administer.
Hardly exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary expenses to be pushed back by mandate fees.
The $70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be absolutely useless had previous governments not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in taxes and tax duties, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to tackle the financial market crisis together.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be placed on the money markets through auctions.
Banks will sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed is going to auction $40 billion and will also provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of individual states have decided to take such concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in his report to clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion to unrepayed loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in billions.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is that they must really understand what can still follow," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“I think the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would lower consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after they failed to lower the interbank rate of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and England repeatedly lowered interest rates during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Tempus Consulting's Greg Salvaggio told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks’ approach will not help to curb the crisis, as it does not address the main problem of the fall of the US real estate market.
President Klaus: Environmentalists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to harm developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism came this time over the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of the environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
"The debate is not structured there at all, it's just a rocket of words, a substitute for solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed at the presentation of his book that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction with the fact that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often find only the caricature of my opinions."
Interested people can now read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless has, in his opinion, enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic capable of following and appreciating scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following thesis: the climate is constantly evolving, the changes in it are therefore normal, there is not a shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too large nor too serious, they therefore represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence the evolution of the climate are inaccurate and unnecessary.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against a fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and the profits they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this topic two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to renew their driver’s license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so the authorities are in the process of issuing a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid licenses will be on the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licences, especially those who no longer want to drive.
As municipalities report a decline in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are flooded with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The City Hall satisfies about 2,000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the release within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to complete the mandatory renewal of the driver's licence by the end of the year and will be on the road without a valid licence, will risk a fine as early as January.
The culprit will be obliged to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence through a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1,000 crowns.
According to Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is a document where people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not as with the identity card that, it, must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer want to drive should hand over their driver’s license.
Simply bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driver's licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers of vehicles are also obliged to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the penalties of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, former police officers accused of collusion with David Berdych’s gang, will be sentenced to thirteen and ten years in prison, respectively.
The High Court of Prague thus sentenced them definitively by reducing their sentences by one year and two years respectively.
Originally, detectives from the Department for Combating Organized Crime risked sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the Higher Court is envisaged.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is only awaiting the trial verdict.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials that exceed 16 years in prison.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court convicted 19 people for participating in the hold-up, and the High Court today dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, the members of the police, after an agreement among others with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to the criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
In return, the gang handed over 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The prosecution is concerned with the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robberies whose victims have, in most cases, suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weapons.
During home searches, the police discovered illegally detained guns, shells with a steel core, a sight for direct laser fire or a machine gun.
According to the allegations, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men in the trial, the courts have already convicted of other robberies by Berdych and a number of other people.
Other men from Berdych's neighbourhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has avoided Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
Attorney for the families Igor Veleba wants compensation of 12 million crowns plus costs from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál does not agree with the proposal of Veleba.
"We reject such a claim, this one is very high," Dostál said at the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party has commissioned the drafting.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the affair, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov’s family demanded one million crowns for each month that she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Center in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, although they were faced with remorse for failing to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, however, remain less serene in the face of the trauma experience in the current situation and in the face of what is happening precisely at the moment, the content of the Veleba report summarized.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermák in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
The governor of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il region gave, at the end of October, to each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of the expenses caused by the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are compelled by law to insure civil liability.
In case of non-compliance, they must tap into the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for help from the manager.
Until now, the courts had recognized relatively low compensation; the amounts calculated from the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Království (the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské království (Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was indeed he who used the title King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, a former collaborator of the actor.
Polivka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasiting on the popularity of Bolek Polivka," Polivka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
“There’s a job behind us for nearly ten years.
“Research for money and development of events,” he said.
According to him, it is the money that is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project is successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title vala<0xC5><0xA1>ský král (King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko) in his TV show.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had nothing to do with the plan to set up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of making Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Království passports appear.
From a humorous action originally came a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, of the company Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that his name and signature should be mentioned in the passport and he even offered the holders balances on the price of the visit to his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the show mané<0xC5><0xBE>, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polivka certainly helped the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské království project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who devoted themselves intensively to the project.
Collaboration between the now enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Polivka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polivka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated with the testimony of "King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, assumed by singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, requesting that the court dismissed it today.
What could clear up the matter is the tournament envisaged for the throne and a half of the princess.
There should be a new king out of it.
He did not want to betray the details and the date yet.
“We don’t want to get to work fast.
It would be something like the parade of the kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polivka can of course register," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I’ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its bearing qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the gearshift, of the driving and also that of the manufacture could, in many ways, be described as lower than the average.
However, there is currently its successor Peugeot 207 on the market, which is significantly better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes one step further, I just have to think better.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I was complaining about, for example, headroom on the back seats.
While there ended the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be, in this regard, comfortable.
Let's see soon done
I will talk about the interior very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the times when one could complain about too short seats or backrests are over.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the body is noticeable there too.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the already mentioned head disappear.
A chest in the chest
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this as very accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel ice) and a rather easy locking.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
According to the tables, this is 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
Other than the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav’s product, we find that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to bring out the advantages, I would mention the underside of the body remaining after the backrests of the rear seats have been overturned perfectly straight, or a very low footstool.
120 horsepower spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that’s what a 1.6 that runs a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by <0xC5><0xA0>koda that often gives the impression of having an exhaust jar blocked by a toothpick, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's look at the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4-litre engine amounting to 329,900 K<0xC4><0x8D> is still reasonable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already enough.
The premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
In addition to head airbags, we have automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
This is a lot, but try to add to the price of the Fabia the extra equipment and you will get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is going badly
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern among the remaining people about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of Northern Kent, where conflicts between remaining and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to escalate, is a good example of the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The quarrels, chicanery and fights between the students have transposed into the relationships between the parents.
The situation has gone so far that police have arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was hitting a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defended herself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenagers.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“When we were coming home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he replied with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students said.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went so far as to call conflicts with immigrants a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above testify that the atmosphere in British schools between natives and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can be achieved if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering you a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
Now, there is only one island on which you will find much more and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the stronghold of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the depository and transshipment place of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the beginning of the 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the US (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he owned his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats once imported have already rotted for a long time, in such a salty and humid climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is substantially decaying, nowhere else in the vicinity are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on the small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the extended plantations in the sweet shops on a narrow track by small steam and engine trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how you can see small locomotives running, whose contemporaries are not elsewhere only in museums.
Where to direct your steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
There is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Not to mention that in the Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that anyone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows there on limestone soil.
Mogotes, limestone balloons and rocks rise in candlelight from the bottom of the valley, and, since fertile soil has caught up in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is probably the place where Cuban tobacco of the highest quality is grown.
The final form of this product can be found if you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was shot.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the market, the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought it glory and wealth.
Wealth has embodied itself in the beauty and the city-showcase character of this small city.
Koloniální <0xC5><0xA1>pan<0xC4><0x9B>lská architecture,výrazn<0xC4><0x9B> ovlivn<0xC4><0x9B>ná pozd<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC5><0xA1>ími francouzskými osadníky, se za <0xC4><0x8D>ty<0xC5><0x99>i staletí tem<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> nezm<0xC4><0x9B>nila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so far apart that even in the 1950s of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on his side.
We were not building anything, and that is why we were not demolishing anything either, everyone was content to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth visiting also some interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which gets alive after sunset and where the music only gets calm in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo must cross high, rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the Eastern Squeeze of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of World Heritage.
We make the best chocolate, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where stands the old castle fort and the current El Castillo hotel, you can see several mountains table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sows and the Island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a number of pages.
Only, as they say, it’s better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of troops and necessary equipment affects, according to the United States, the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not going as it should, agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland representatives of countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing protest by the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and coordination of allies.
While the U.S. this week, through Defense Minister Robert Gates, called NATO troops to greater activity, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government’s authority and the intensification of development assistance.
“Evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the residents to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to US military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent from last year, to 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
Now, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop made similar comments today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that is not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts between the countries involved on the question of whether all allies are effectively doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat demands they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the south and east parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
“The lazy Afghans discovered: Germans play while ours fight,” Sun wrote in a document supplemented with photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to the counterattack by posting a photo of a British troupe during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt to rise to one trillion in 2009
The burden of a debt of the state exceeding 84,000 crowns lies with each Czech.
The total debt rose at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
Thanks to better-than-expected government budget savings, the Department has reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The debt of the state of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
During the nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, as of June, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the debt of the State in early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns lies with each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has indebted more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it appears that, thanks to a smaller deficit projected for next year, we could cross the border by one trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor's forecast is similar: "We could exceed the trillion in 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were willing to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I’m not expecting that change,” he said.
Debts are Growing
The debt of the state is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
Government debt is financed by treasury bills, bonds, direct loans or by borrowing from the European Investment Bank, for example.
The state's domestic debt has so far increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state’s external debt has so far increased this year from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the state called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from the month of June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt liability of the State was 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased year-on-year from the first to the third half of the year by 13 percent, which, given the current good health of the economy, is far too high.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by annuity securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be something to negotiate when the pension reform comes," Pikora said.
Better than we expected
This follows the 2007 State Debt Financing and Management Strategy, which the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected evolution in the savings of the state budget, the ministry reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The amount is essentially constituted by the deficit in the state budget, which is clearly going to reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the originally planned 91.3 billion crowns.
Second, the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency are 13.3 billion crowns, the 10 billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and the repayments of the European Investment Bank's loans of 1.8 billion crowns.
She was in court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and to deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting pupils ages 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punished with whips.
The 54-year-old British teacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with attacking Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when the teacher asked her 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the caption “My name is Mohamed”.
The bear itself did not carry any label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said it was only an "innocent mistake."
The opinion shared by many of the teacher's pupils who describe her as "very caring for her pupils" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the Prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
For example, can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians concluded a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is unfortunate that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was “at stake,” his U.S. counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to abide by their commitments to preserving peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We do not anticipate violence immediately, but we are entering a very difficult time,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90 percent-albanophone province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian ombudsman Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with further mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo at the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsan-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide in her favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," Kosovo's president Fatmir Sejdiu said at the hotel in Baden, where the "last chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.”
‘domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said it feared a "domino effect" in a region still fragile by the independence wars of the 1990s.
“For Serbia,” he said, “this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be made exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
“The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word”
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status,” adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers would be made “in consultation” with Westerners.
Bush torn a deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George W. Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he met Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations with a view to reaching a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides to their obligations under the “roadmap” for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority presided over by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues".
This appellation covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian litigation: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the U.S. president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “global and deep” and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others.”
In turn, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks will be "direct and continuous" and make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for the implementation of his coexisting Palestinian and Israeli “two-state vision.”
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this direction from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," said Prince Saud in his interview with the Saudi-capitaled Arabic-speaking daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of fact various, official versions and rumors oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspection General of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., on Rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a gyroscope," a police source said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "unapproved, therefore not allowed to drive on the public road" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating "at very fast pace".
“She hit the police car on her left, after a denial of priority on the right,” one policeman said.
The blood alcohol control on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before crashed, star windshield, bumper torn off) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, coasied with the departmental directorate of public safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-bike arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a sort of groove, probably caused by the friction of the foot pads on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right afterwards?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police had very quickly left the place, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out “any serious misconduct” in this regard.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, which we need to be very careful about," a police source said.
Libération met with an eyewitness from those few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows overlooking the scene.
“We went down right away, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them,” said the witness.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely hagard policeman, who was lame.
Two others were trying to revive one of the youngsters, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the youth, the police officers were driven by colleagues arriving at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived “about twenty minutes after the police departed.”
They also performed heart massages, in vain.
“I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first protests since General Musharraf imposed a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
They responded by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several have been arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers for the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other protests were reported to have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday garnered support from religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "exhorted the population to send flowers to judges who have pronounced against the state of emergency and rubbish to those who have sworn in before Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise no longer holds."
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly targeted by the exception measure proclaimed Saturday night.
She was due to vote in the coming days on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election to the presidential election, on October 6, by indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was expelled and replaced.
“Everything we’re witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president “no longer holds” after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf was allegedly placed under house arrest by his deputy chief of armies.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) is not predicted, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unforeseen births.
The various methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, the Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception has allowed for better "fertility control", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
It can even be calculated per month for one in five couples and, if possible, in the spring, which is the most pleasant season to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took more than seven hours for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, which is indispensable for the station's continued scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "made" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday as the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical part that will soon host the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of docking station for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a 17.5-ton solar panel power generation module, already present on the ISS, to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the module's solar panels that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, unfolding like accordions, was damaged on nearly a meter by a cable that stuck.
Deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally to perform a control exit from the Discovery shuttle and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go snail at the end of the 30 meter long remotely controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, durable, very handy, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, the trained doctor was tasked with “operating” the “wounded” solar panel.
After accurately inspecting the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and installed some kind of "spindles" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker staying near the airs and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey cane wrapped in insulation to prevent electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "crafted" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making an inventory of his tools and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS securities sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS stock is currently falling sharply on the Paris stock exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the A400M delays.
EADS is currently losing 4% at 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast due to delays caused by the slow progression in the development of the A400M engine, which condition the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, including more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these expenses, EADS will be obliged to announce new operating earnings targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operating profit fell by 86 per cent in 2006, mainly due to delays in another programme, the very large A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the exit of the ballot box: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the general elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let any of this come to light by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of meddling - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and want honest, transparent and open elections, elections without flaws,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
She denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov said there had never been such a dirty election, even at the time of Yeltsin.
After the crackdown on protests last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the homo sovieticus mentality"
Behind these suspenseless legislatures are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
No successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in the legislature and in the presidential election, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the homo sovieticus mentality, they don’t feel mastery of their destiny,” said Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Historian Nikolay Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin reconnected with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was followed not by terror, but by some economic ease,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians “willingly renounce personal responsibility” which they had briefly demonstrated after the breakup of the USSR.
“What good is it to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite wants to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: “What good is it to think about?
Those in power aren’t too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are openly accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only available for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his descendants.
The eleven states responsible for managing them - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all States was completed, the opening had been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out “in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers,” explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, had objected to the opening to the public of such personal documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subject to compulsory labour and, eventually, to provide proof of their detention, in order to pave the way for compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are hoping to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
In April, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to negotiate free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s 9th trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free trade pact will greatly boost both economies” and “India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second European market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week BarIndeja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that the EU's bilateral trade was not the "potential" of the

Bank of England raises concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was concerned to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced a ten-billion-pound offer at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on December 6th in the form of an open-market transaction," it said.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
It seems to be the first time that BoE puts liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market transaction.
These are normally done within a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain rates" of day-to-day interbank loans in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, a high since 18 September.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put on the market by the Bank of England had been accompanied by a high penalty rate that had dissuaded banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, backed up by the evolution of the pound price compared to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more favourable rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS purchasing power proposals
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS including the increase of 50% of the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the supervision of rents.
Since UMP and NC voted against the consideration of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was suspended after the general discussion which resulted in exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS MEP leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill discussed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following many rumors about C3 Presents' creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is scheduled to take place August 8-10 on a private 500-acre farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the lead at the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which now accommodates up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We chose Philadelphia as a marketplace and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we got stuck in politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are about to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Chicago’s Grant Park after standing out in the festival scenery in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours rather take place in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a European country festival and an American urban festival.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event,” said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but affirms that "they are interesting enough to allow us to invest in such an event and host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hosting capacity for the festival is “very large,” like 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of going to the press.
“Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movies to Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes it...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A warrant - "politically difficult" because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions."
Is it difficult to play in the paws of the “Governor”?
“We have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds that conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best," he said.
The Race to Festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte’s priority is the promotion of cinema here.
The Oscars race has begun.
All West Coast festivals, from Sundance, Denver, Seattle to San Francisco, will be about presenting Quebec films, showcasing them and making sure the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is featured in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year the experts are not as sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December on the stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, since in the current context, uncertainties await the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favour of the stock market gaining momentum in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is nourished by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of leaking towards quality values both in the short and long periods".
For this, they believe that the stock market will be acting rather laterally, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," the expert said.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock market index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during those dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the Constitution Day bridge (December 6th).
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound in the index that could be caused based on information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new highs.
Intermoney’s Solana says “this year the big values are back for him.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and a few manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco says that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get there.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other constructors like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will play a major role in the latter part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that tech companies will do it as well very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, only on two occasions, December has been a bearish month.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which time the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the piercing of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the time being Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in computer at its end-of-year rally.
The People's Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it was the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open on Saturday from 10 am to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it would like to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to reach an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experiment will be decisive for other organizations to adhere or not to this initiative, which coincides with business hours.
This is precisely what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers who move in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and the shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 offices located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since this is not the opening of new offices but a renovation of the already existing ones.
For this purpose, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
Bank sales manager <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera says this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of Madrid’s Murillo Brave, O’Donnell and Gran Vía streets are the streets to be chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very ample hours, which open even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the model of BBVA, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' Rivero remarks.
For now, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this phrase, Paolo Vasile, a delegate adviser to Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the close of the stock market, when he found that the channel he runs was doubling the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect tarnished his joy: “What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have lowered less,” he said.
However, it emphasized the fact that in a low market, ‘we have fallen less’.
Telecinco finished yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66% over the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which sold 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of other publicly traded communication companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first TV channel this year to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order for this announced figure to be real, the television channel should record a 3.6% increase in advertising revenue for the current fiscal year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antenne 3's net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (to 734.4 million), while net television revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for Telecinco's best relative development on the stock market is the significant pay-out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official compromise to give at least 50 percent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its earnings estimates on Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This, they explain, is due to the decrease in expected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company reduced the Antenne 3 earnings forecast to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on November 1st
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of Congress on amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MPs and senators to negotiate and agree to the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies to ensure that markets operate effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of the financial markets, at a time when it strengthens the protection of the investor, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial advisory services for both specialized corporate and legal reasons and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (FIBs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which face competition from existing stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment firms to disclose information on the market on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and obliges them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate control on the part of the CNMV.
Passing through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, including one that highlights that securitised debt will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with U.S. high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management has taken advantage of to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics may have 30 years after in 1977, was approved, the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its product marketing and new client attraction services to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonized consumer price index increased by five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on the development of prices in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method as the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The NSI recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily coincide with the final data to be revealed on December 14th.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the 4.1% increase in CPI in November was a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes said in Congressional corridors that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential over monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We expected a figure around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged from the figure announced today.
Virgin plans to recover 42,000 million euros with Northern Rock over three years
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it was raising some record deposits above <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a figure that was gradually dropped in two and a half months because of the mistrust of its clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenues of the UK banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18,000 million until the target of $30,000 million is reached.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its screaming advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin association, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
AIn addition, one of the secretaries of the city council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May’s me Juan Morales, current right-wing deputy, and until then city councillor of the city hall, who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the ‘leader’ of this scheme.
Officers continue to search municipal premises and those of the Urban Planning Council and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As reported yesterday by the SER Channel to the lawyer of the deputy of the 'popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested leaving the home of Morales with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are being detained.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party’s candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the election
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the top of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of Congress in case the Socialists will win the general elections.
Thus the organization secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Mancha will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over Congress if the socialists will win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of Congress, which on November 15 made public his decision not to run for the next general election and to give up his political career to devote himself to fighting climate change in the academic context.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
Moreover, he noted that although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or scream" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only local in Madrid where one cannot talk quietly and calmly is Congress, the president of the Government in the Senate on certain occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to pretend that he was already occupying his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider "a domination".
A Climate Propaganda
Given that the climate change movement subjects both the skeptics of its predictions and those that prioritize other political and social battles to merciless persecution, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government contributed in a decisive way to Spain being the leader of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures he will take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be required for us, what economic consequences this will have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been and there will be no explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to one hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to Zapatero readily so dangerous that he rushed to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans empty of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, beautifies the meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we move on a bicycle or refresh ourselves with the range.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a hotel contractor suspected for possible urban crimes, informed the sources of the investigation today.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the city hall, where at the moment many agents met, who also presented themselves to the City Councillor's Office of Urban Planning and the municipal management company of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six arrests made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial inquiry, which is being investigated by Totana Tribunal No. 1.
The first six detainees went to court today.
According to the sources, Totana’s previous city councillor and currently autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was imputed, as well as the current fiancée of the former city councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor of Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, the agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is carried out by the UCO (Urban Crimes Unit) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies linked to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, who may have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana which have been requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which take care of real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the parking lots of Vigo in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which takes care of direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the commentary from yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (certain at the top of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course has challenged public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he asserted that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of offences on downloads on the Internet:
A. Downloading a song would be a criminal offence punishable by a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is only considered a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the penalty imposed for downloading it (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a penalty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without authorization of the authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).

My attending doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research titled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group in charge of neurocognition images at the Life&Brain Institute, Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers observed that when both people guessed that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals since the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died-, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, ' the list of Carla ' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who pursues the criminals on the run and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What insurance is right for me?
Automobile insurance, which covers the driver against possible claims, involves a significant expense that will depend on a variety of factors, such as age, sex, the age of the driver's licence, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is realized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the insurance price, which is determined by taking into account a variety of factors, such as age, sex, age of the driver's licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the odds to be paid.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower claim rate due to their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when determining the price of the premium.
This is why the driver must carefully study the situation to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will present the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers him a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various drawbacks when contracting with affordable insurance, as may be the low experience in driving and the seniority of the driver's license.
While the ideal to be well insured is insurance at all risk, there are other, more economical options.
The most forward-thinking drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with deductible, so that they get insurance coverage at all risks but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays a portion of the amount of the claim.
"The portion of the claim amount that the customer pays will be determined based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head in Spain of First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damages caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Advice.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be cautious and avoid claims as much as possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a sanction is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses ", clarifies Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers to enter into an insurance contract, since the rate of claims is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is better to choose insurance all risk with deductible.
"Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience previously acquired after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest claim rate, because the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be insurance at all risk with deductible (may be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of the life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
“They have more casual driving and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury to assume a larger amount of franchises,” said Luis Noguera.
For retirees, insurance at all risk with a deductible is preferable (being this one of 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that auto insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will seek to earn a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are competing next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they are missing to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians have scored ten points and they have already qualified in the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
Both Group D matches will take place a week before the sixth day ends, as AC Milan is scheduled to compete in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on December 13 in search of a place for the 16th-December final.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most anticipated result, although the two teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that winning would keep him first and ensure a better cross in the eighths of the final.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan’s team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn’t win, but she won’t be able to computer only on that since with nine points the game is back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
For example, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who are hoping to qualify for the eighth final for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal by Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the rossoneri the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in case the Celtic would lose, to qualify for the eighths of the final to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, despite being the last and with no chances to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the band's reunion is "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people have sold out tickets to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video telling the story of the group that raged in the late 1990s.
The meeting and world tour coincided with the release of a new album that recaptured their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI released in Spain.
The five Spice Girls came on stage showing the bracelets that Posh Spice's husband, British footballer David Beckham, had given them.
The athlete was in the crowd filling GM Place, although Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice', which was part of the band in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the group's dissolution two years later, also expressed its nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the show began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that people’s feelings changed, the feelings for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “things got arranged and we appreciate each other a lot.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last showed up in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of baby sitters was waiting for them.
They have five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will exhibit in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will be exhibited in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is setting off the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas is fermenting between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are carried by pipelines, and each pipeline is carefully monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia’s proprietary monopoly company providing the gas, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as expected, given that it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would mean for Ukraine a 40% increase in import costs from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all of our arguments during the conversations, reminding us that we are a country through which most of the gas passes,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, resulting in higher prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stockpiles, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health “must monitor its foreign employees.”
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the controls to be carried out on its extra-community employees to check if they have previous penalties, the control committee said.
The Auditor General’s warning, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health does not have any specific data on the number of overseas workers it employs.
Its report nevertheless highlighted other decisive checks, correctly performed on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The Auditor General conducted checks on extra-community personnel following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving his jeep into the main terminal gates.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October on suspicion of being involved in various attempts to explode cars in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out the controls of previous penalties, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Britain.
Among the many warnings, the report of the Auditor General now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Control of previous penalties, thus allowing employers to undertake controls over various countries.
"While we have found that some of the staff information has been verified, this is not done every time," the report says.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health is conducting most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: “Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information about certain overseas staff members is available to health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
"The report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings may add any added value."
The Scottish health authorities said they employed 1,161 overseas workers, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of problems with identifying staff with an indefinite contract, who might or might not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for health authorities controls in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are fully adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment checks for staff outside the ocean of the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was excited to carry out this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Government of Scotland allied with the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment checks, valid for all employees, including overseas persons.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio peak on Joy Division’s latest singer, Ian Curts, has won 5 awards, including Best Picture, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was engaged in the role of Curtis in this film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Madame Judi Dench was named Best Actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for allowing the British film to be in the international spotlight.
The prizes were distributed during the ceremony at London's Round House.

But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best director debut.
The Rock also received the Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor award was given to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mafia boss in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his tough character performances, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, having shot films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of star Harris, the protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me access to cinema,” he said.
“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admired by this great current actor, I was extremely honored.”
The Oscars for the independent film, better known as "Les Bifas", are awarded by a jury composed of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia Blocks 208 Terrifying Conspiracies
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells handling an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clergy and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters have been campaigning against the Allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 soldiers to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, citing a statement by the interior minister, said 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell run by a “missile launch expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appear to have plotted the assassination of clergymen and armed forces.
The government has urged clergy to do more against the Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Shiite Muslim government allied with the United States, considered heresy according to the hard line of the Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clerics have collaborated with the authorities to support the royal family policy that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
The armed forces have made significant efforts over the last five months,” the interior minister’s spokesman said on state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized into a “media cell” to promote “takfiri thought”, the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit has shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, unlike previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to Earth’s, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with a slower rotation, led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is devoid of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface hot enough to melt lead there.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency’s probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford’s Department of Physics, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, possibly even with a habitable surface."
Uranium enriched sequestered by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would be worth $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney has said he is not up to the standard as a presidential candidate, to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who recorded their questions submit them to candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions posed were as ridiculous as that of another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their stance on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers a lot reflected the conditions of the Republican party, candidate for the next election.
It’s unclear on what criteria the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on a single theme, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the strong topics for Republicans.
CNN has asked some voters to call when they hear pleasant things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates were rudely speaking.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who led the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote “amnesia” (offering clandestine people regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have managed to delve into this topic.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they started fighting immigration before and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, coupled with concerns, particularly about the toxic toys made in China, or other fears of the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or minimize, divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in its entirety, the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, -- in position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism -- declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus was in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus is too chic to run for election.
The human race remains insolently open to everything.
Huckabee’s rise to Iowa coincides with recent prodigious grant research by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistling in Wednesday’s debate.
These two have emerged from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two party protégés cannot agree on who is the best-known and most traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and convincingly through a message of success on American grandeur bringing leaders together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pain of Labour
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of the British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra conjugal foot finger sucked.
But here is a revelation that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle Gordon Brown would have gone through.
Two months ago, the prime minister backtracked on his draft election, stupidly insulting British intelligence proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, like Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The acquisition of Northern Rock, a bank struggling on the brink of crack, has demonstrated a breach of directives and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have provoked a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative buzz.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against military spending cuts: they proclaimed that being defense minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of ludicrous donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labour (and his former head of vigilance) has forced them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading for the exit.
However, governments can come to a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and don’t trust them, but generally leave their doubts on the side when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers take stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any purpose.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to dismiss Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
The problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions made when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he’s not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long investigation into the party’s “cash money for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But Mr. Brown's difficult situation is not as tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party make them believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there is no victim or scam.
And the remedy, though painful, might be to realize Mr. Brown’s old Stalinist tendencies, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very peculiar figure who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it's not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of big politicians’ subsidiaries are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has a right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as did Jon Mendlesohn, the head of grant collections who had spoken about the dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: There is no evidence that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has made half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on a trick he knows well, resorting to a committee of inquiry on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards of Public Living, who has been without a leader for six months, and preparing for good reform on the financial aspects of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for such a supporter as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good lead for the elections; it has two years to regain voters, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate blameless integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see fins whirl around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measure the non-recoverable or non-recoverable balance sheet shares more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly because of weak cardholders.
It is too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the third-quarter insolvency rate of 3.89% is nearly one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in laws in 2005 in the United States concerning personal bankruptcy caused an abrupt fall in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers must pay.
and confidence in credit card capital security is fairly strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, has predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow rather than wealth value, and so the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily result in a change in borrowers' credibility.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card indebtedness would become a priority to repay the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of stocks.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial catastrophe in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market drive America into recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Pay attention to the back fins.
The British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to testify to their roles in a fraud committed by Enron's previous CFO, Mr. Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially pleaded innocent of the seven charges of alleged fraud collusive in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to get rich in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland’s PLC group, have become famous across Britain because of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron Debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, dubbed the Natwest Three, claim to have come to Houston in 2000 to stage a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hander, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him trick bankruptcy procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary to be null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought interest from the subsidiary bank for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in interest for the company.
Fastow allegedly falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth, those $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, the bankers would have gotten $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year imprisonment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britons were released following payment of a deposit of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national corporation, bankrupted in December 2001 after years of accounting trickery, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its bogus speculation as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in market value loss, and more than $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were futile because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Not in or out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs as many seats as this is more of a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Salon des Millionaires, a four-day consumer incentive orgy that takes place in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to attract the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to cars filled with diamonds such as those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his booth.
“It’s a pretty car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market.”
Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to roll in black gold, like Dallas.
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so wealthy and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerged as the world’s largest spenders.
The top luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are comprised of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are globally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists at the economic and financial research center.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweller.
She participated in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, The Jeweler Group of Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking through the lounge on Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, claim to be like their clients, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Mlle Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the corks to come to a huge warehouse where are exhibited Cadillac Escalades, knives in platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, custom billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears G.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and the best brands,” said Mr Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Delf factory stand, in front of a handmade wall painting of Rambrandt on blue tiles.
“Russians are more interested in bling bling.
Indeed, the vendors here stated that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too much according to Russian standards) have already gone from bright logos to a kind of limited-edition brand that could not sell at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, walk through the exhibition every day.
Some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, King Koil Bed CEO Roman Ershow said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold to a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tyres,” Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage containing already 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Even though many of his Russian customers are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There’s more than you might think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Continental Alliance, a Russian heritage management company.
The company erected four stands representing British telephone booths, filled with mass counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake notes for the Millionaire show.
Passers arrested to throw masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the midst of this fake wealth or pocketing a few millions.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unaccredited surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving Eve when Ronald Livingston looked out the bay window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and watched an ambulance just stopped at the gates of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another one.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone had died.
Authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, which police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are confidently awaiting the results of toxicology tests that, unfortunately, will take time but should solve this mysterious death that saddened senior Newark police ranks.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to police director Garry F. Mc Carthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
“She was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done everything to protect me.”
McCarthy said Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she left two 14- and 11-year-old sons, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgery.
“This is a possibility to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since then, and authorities have not said much about the investigation nor even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro’s home where a faded rose tree rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked at the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in cooking and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two off-road bikes hung on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and still there when I was leaving.
“It was embarrassing”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower rates linked to the effervescence of the global stock market.
Shares are exploding on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, subsequently lowering interest rates promoted by the calming statements of the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, #2 after Ben Bernanke, president of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide should be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in turbulent financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure the irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Mr Kohn said that the recent turbulence has in part “reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
In the event that this severe turbulence persists, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further interest rate cuts could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest fall in real estate sales for October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil have been accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will license 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 positions are planned in London where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, 2.55% concluding at 13,289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index gained 165.5 points or 2.7% concluding at 6306.2 adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of UK companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of credit difficulties in the markets has been highlighted as a result of the high demand for a tri-month auction of funds issued by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy 4.7% rate, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to inject further funds into London's financial markets, causing credit tensions, has caused the British banks' monthly "Libor" sorted borrowing rates to cause their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a sharp rise since November 12.
England faces an appeal to judgement against critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the 6th drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the coaches who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the CEO of England, begins to fill out the application forms to become a national coach, at least part-time.
Those who fail to win the No. 6 backpack will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is it fair to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new executives with good professional degrees, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the correct level of a cricketer unless they are given at least one chance?
Figures are important in decisions, but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a beater must be lucky to hit the cricketer for a day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself fit and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it will be Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primordial cricketer of the Test, and this despite the fact that his double-hundred score against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
Probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and foster Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start to the innings of the 88-test in Mumbai, 32 cents first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah made only ten laps in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the coaches when Vaughan was back in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his obvious impetus in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy of life.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently threw himself on a 4x4 at a presentation by Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He postponed only slight injuries, was shocked, although the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at him from afar, to ask him if "'did he see this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his shooting pace allows him to do services that go for him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could it be the real art of selection?
I would be conducive to giving Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who will play this weekend.
Buses take people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping those exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has returned to normal.
Some came back to fight against the militants who drove them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and because the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to leave for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime is preventing Iraqis from working.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-aided militia allowed al-Qaeda to be driven out of the western capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he prompted citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
But he had to come back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been drawn to the capital’s growing calm since U.S. troops arrived, and to the sight of continuing training of “groups of citizens involved” well armed and collaborating with the U.S. military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, expressed suspicion by everyone about visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people are reported to have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to no longer give visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decline in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees will once again escalate sectarian tensions and bring the fighting back.
Little Saar, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in vocational training, and shines even by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-desire, posters for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high proportion of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saarland also leads the children of the country to higher schools in above-average numbers - many of them without a diploma from the Gymnasium.
"In Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people earns their degree in a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the dual-curriculum panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education of Sardinia has obliged the higher schools to a marketing campaign in the subjects of engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we have celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
For children to start learning earlier, the final year of daycare is exempt from the law - a model that other federated states in the meantime copy as well.
Only future comparison studies will show whether students' performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the number of at-risk students decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not improve as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of the Sardinians, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise you could earn points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in high schools - even if the Sarrentians are not French.
Chávez sets watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will raise the chronometer for half an hour in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez became a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, as a result of a new law, the watches will be set to less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position among other things by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a hostage case.
The left nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it, just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is awaiting a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on through a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe’s decision to withdraw from Chávez the mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe reportedly "spiced in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, Chávez had criticized Sunday.
In Spain Chávez is also in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ringtone rages the country: "Why don't you shut up" is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded from the internet.
It was spoken by Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who at the most recent Ibero-American summit was angry at the constant calls from left-wing populists and told him to be silent.
Wage cuts threaten Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic conditions, according to a forecast, a real undervalue of wages threatens German employees this year.
Experts cited all sorts of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in low wage development, higher value-added tax and rising food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told Bild.
New burdens could also arise in terms of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" newspaper that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance of 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and whirlwinds at the poles, similar to those that appear on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning strikes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today has proved this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: lightning flashes on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprine, lightning has reportedly made life appear on Earth: the storm has allegedly stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life was there, it must have been at a very early date in history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be few living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes with temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the Earth’s infernal twin, but it remains a twin,” Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of Venus Express in November 2005 was an important milestone in Venusian research, as no spacecraft had been on the way for exploration of the planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the latest research results that have now been presented in several papers in "Nature" do not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the Earth’s common ground on our neighboring planet is more numerous than initially assumed.
Thus, the researchers found, in addition to the already known wind whirls at the North Pole, a whirlwind of clouds at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the earth's hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called an evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much slower on itself: one Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD because of the attacks against the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and summons the grand coalition to close the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We must not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance of foreign policy, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would organize a new policy of China.
The German Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional one-China policy.
"China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for it outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained about the CDU’s “frontier policy” on foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only decommanded German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from the Spiegel, also froze the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
China’s head of government Wen Jiabao is now demanding German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that welcoming the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive Tibet’s spiritual leader in his official duties, Wen Jiabao said.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also encompasses other current provinces.
Schäuble warned against riots like those in France.
Street fighting with police, shooting, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not burst into the streets by violence, demanded the German Interior Minister.
Barricades burning, breakers shooting at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not build up in our homes as well and de-escalates into violence.
We must take this seriously," he told the "New Press" published in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end to the warning.
Schäuble notes, at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police over the past few nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be above average.
Above all, more training spaces should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish communities, however, added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many immigrant youth also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat exhorted: "But we must still be cautious."
It is important to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training.
In the meantime, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flying over the area with spotlights.
The authorities reported three arrests as well as a few cars and trash cans burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured in the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles were overflowing in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor's utopian entry shows that the coalition has ended with the bottom - and that there is nothing more to expect from her.
In what country does this Chancellor live?
After his desolate intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The accusation of focusing too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous phrase.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, she made it visible to everyone how accurate this reproach was.
There was no concrete interest or little feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, fleeing into foreign policy and even there remaining in the near.
For example, climate protection: in this respect, it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements again and again, but does not say how the climate targets should be achieved in our country.
Even praise of itself - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now it clings to ready-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
In this way it destroys its image of pragmatist, which solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela Cloud empire, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few adjunct sentences left for this.
In this respect, the number of times she makes lapses when it comes to family allowance is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a half-precise sentence.
She shudders in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, both favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are embarking on a tough offensive battle — and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already breaking out on the first subject.
He allegedly made New York a "refuge for illegals," Mitt Romney blames his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
He said: "I would say that his own home was a haven for illegal immigrants," Giuliani replied, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing undocumented immigrants.
Candidates rise to attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that internet users have sent via YouTube are hardly more than just blowers.
“It is with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power,” John McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly taught by Vietnam Veterans, when he refuses to condemn as a torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation that simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the campaign’s important themes meanwhile go beyond the war in Iraq and debates about torture can be seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Common Room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax increases are denied, applause is pouring into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites once again reveal themselves.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney said, contritely apologizing to the base and the television audience for still being an abortion supporter in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, goes into a flowing node when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil.
A day after his withdrawal as head of armies, Pakistani ruling man Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army ended.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was inaugurated on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as chief of armies to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power by a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another requirement of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the state of emergency with lawyers from his ranks, rejected last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The Krautrock fathers are returning.
The supergroups of Germany of the seventies replay: the three members of the group Harmonia once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return were released recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
It is flanked to the left of Michael Rother, a 57-year-old and in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, watched throughout the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a beat.
And sometimes this adds inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again has secured some emotions among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, while the name reasones in the collective memory of pop, it is not in any way so lasting that this group has been so painfully missing for 32 years.
But why wouldn’t the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called "Krautrock" has always rained more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work in 2003, the German pop faces interrogators were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in panegyric praise, the astonishment was boundless.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped onto the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the impact power that was felt was much weaker than what was later attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly troubled himself in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile in the forests of the Weserbergland.
There, in an old Weser farmhouse, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
There was supposedly in the trash can a fanion of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmonia away from this.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
For as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead timber did not serve itself alone in search of itself.
The CD "Live 1974" which has just been released was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as someone thinks he remembers.
Rother issued at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
This was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the album Live of Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been unearthed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the whole margin of fluctuation of the influence of the Krautrock would be enclosed with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase flies through the room in the midst of singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future".
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of wired tools in bazaar are used to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and drums, to shoot instruments with unprecedented sounds thanks to self-built effects instruments.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
The three in large technical piggers.
Even that the choir of the house will not change.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots have been sought less in the blues than in the music conservatories (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia too is no longer irritated by this from now on.
But what goes most of itself will be meticulously covered on stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can hit someone’s nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace", two films again address the Balkan War.
But the two are not convincing.
Either the projects rely too much on action and senseless shooting exchanges or, on the contrary, they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news is that the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the most dismal backcountry of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because far too many kind and futile roles in sentiment films for women and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him with the desire to show up.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch anyway "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunter (why should today's films be as long and confused as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of winks: deep down, his character as war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not as benevolent: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remnants of his old charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Mortal Peace", which is also released this week, the endless continuation of failed films about the Balkan War.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian from the Kosovar free-shooters, in which one of the two still quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not presented for once as the sole cause of all evils, this film as flat as a TV movie is lost far too quickly in action and the exchanges of senseless shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why deep down there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track down the top war criminal "the fox", could possibly have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both at once Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go in a small team into the forest, to accomplish something the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we just don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian murdered afterwards.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the postponer, in the space of the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, succeeds in what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not succeeded in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving him for just revenge to the Muslim Bosniaks.
This is so bad that we should go to the Hague International Court of Crime against Cinematic Logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt quite intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be mean."
Movies such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such bumpy heads, but that hint at how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there has never been a good movie about South Africa before.
What is worth every time: when a star hangs out on a crisis hotbed or on a minefield, he then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits aller Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or ""Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood can make a good movie about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List."
Some films have yet to mature - those that today are worth classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have in no way been celebrated unanimously in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know too much today about the conflicts of the world, where every hecatombe arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And that delighted writers with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The dictator" actually became as good as well because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change."
"The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrifying way, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust received criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's retreat from Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics has clashed in politics and the economy with fierce criticism.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games by the water.
But von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
Hamburg Chamber of Commerce chief Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz on Wednesday described an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has deployed more motivating forces in the city than the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this goal, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz urges the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new, longer-term starting point, "which takes as its starting point another amended agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday to his previous statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, regarding Munich’s candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that in the timeframe that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However, the dream is not definitively in the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sport Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would further contradict the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in plenary of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust reportedly called Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had initially in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD fraction of the mayor blamed the Senate for not using this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics card and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for a plan integrated into the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing for the Petit Grasbrook, the CDU is said to have relied exclusively on the "Event Factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg had, however, broken against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
The one who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
Much of the ninety "Type Stockholm" Brillo-Boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago questioned the authenticity of the "Brillo-Boxes of the Year" of Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm today results in a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the Pontus Hulten museum gave the "Brillo-Boxes of the Year" to the international moderna Museet in 1995.
Ancient history is entangled, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden cases, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powdered soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 presented - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cartoning factory.
These were not works of art here, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to have some wooden cases produced by Brillo in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time speak today of about fifteen wooden crates that at the time were said to have entered the history of art and auctions, as authorized original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol, with the designation "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later wrongly claimed that about one hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol later ceded to him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmö in 1990 alone, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminate panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies dating back to 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was directly applied to the laminated panels without a bottom layer, using a paint roll - moreover, it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic one.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," suggests Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come up with another decision, the Moderna Museet's collection will classify all six boxes into one.
Already in July the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers abandoned, the same ones who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not be held responsible for any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to the power had stormed the hotel shortly before using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
Approximately half of them were standing in court on Wednesday over a failed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse himself with about 30 supporters.
The military police, who were normally to monitor them, apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal troops in power circled the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have had enough,” Trillanes said.
“We are calling people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who commanded before the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said other army units would soon want to join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a large demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila was already the scene of the mutiny attempt by some 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke down nearly 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a buyout.
The option would remain open to further increase the stake in Versatel.
This step is aimed at accelerating the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, the market is told.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth €106.4 million on the stock exchange.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesman said.
The two companies founded the MSP holding company in order to absorb competitor Freenet.
At the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not to make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
However, the two companies would leave all options open, particularly to increase the stake in SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet over a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The hardly predictable poker on Freenet that has lasted for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers linked to a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL and full subscription customers.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillisch had so far held a 6.01 percent direct stake in Freenet.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring an additional four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
