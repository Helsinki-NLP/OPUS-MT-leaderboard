Food is to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, the inflation rate was higher in November than expected - after the 2.6% in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1% was recorded, as reported by the Statistical Office of the EU in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were just 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the Leitzins. In its discretion, the interest rate reduction would favor rising commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment to create an inflationary spiral.
The ECB is striving to keep the inflation rate below 2%, or at least close to the 2% mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in a state of crisis: one has to “condemn” inflation in order to rule out the need for further action.
At 3.3 per cent, the inflation rate in November reached a 12-year record high in Germany; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the eurozone has been driven by rising food and energy prices.
MATIF wheat listings rose by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in the price of food oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to decline to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3% inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1%.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while approval for the socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
With partisan voters, the difference is clear thanks to the strong determination of the opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) oppose one-fifth (20 percent) of support for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry barrier: they come up to 2% in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the overall economic mood has further deteriorated - never before has the share of those who judge the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "pretty bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth expects an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents — a historic high — rated the prime minister’s work as “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have strong or general confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the leader of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be managed even without a change of government.
After the riots last October, 35% had voted for the remainder of the government and the head of government, today that share is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent answered that they would “certainly” participate, and another 20 percent would “probably” cast their vote.
By way of comparison: if the parliamentary elections were to be held this Sunday, only 55 percent would "surely" go to the polls, another 15 percent would consider their participation to be "probable".
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% would vote against the hospital day-to-day allowance.
Turned to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the proportions of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, or 89 percent, respectively.
Even the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area also maintained this year’s average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, although price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets "galoped" last December, the percentage of the price has not fallen drastically, compared to the already high, earlier baseline level.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they had paid for well below 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the same level as the previous year, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but Auchan had 1kg of bread for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop to below 200 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-litre Coca-Cola pledge bottle of less than 200 forint, so the drink including pledge cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year's "Napi" shopping cart comparison showed Auchan the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between last year’s cheapest cart and today’s most expensive cart was 12%, while the increase between last year’s cheapest cart and last year’s most expensive cart was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 forint, but the VAT increase was noticeable in the prices at last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has hit trade badly: it seems that the warehouses were not quite able to decide what price range they should apply to the individual items, since the effects of the price increase on consumption behaviour were inevitable.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of a product poorly, he can fall for substantial profits in the price range, which is dependent on the traffic intensity.)
The price of the Napi shopping cart last year fell so radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1.630.00 forint more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284.00 forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, with the price of daily consumables in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office found more than 30 per cent of the cost over the 12-month period.
So about besides flour also eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has increased by barely more than 10 percent in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to roll the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets are not complaining; good years are constantly being reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses are no longer looking at prices.
They are bought from everything large quantities, durable food goes in pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning there were endless queues at the checkout in all three department stores, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country is reported to have a lower frequency of customers, so many multis complain among the opinion pollsters that they could not even achieve the planned sales, not only in food but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places disinfectants are saved
More than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals due to improper handling of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overcrowding of staff - all factors that are not exactly beneficial to the containment of infections, according to the senior doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of the János hospital, an MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection.
The injured person in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly afterwards the man had to return with an MRSA infection. Since then, an important operation has not been performed due to the bacterium that is still in the patient's body.
By December 10 of this year, 1094 hospitals have reported infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, senior physician at the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark number is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, tonsil inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are dosed too high or improperly used, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are produced from the well-responsive bacteria, which under appropriate conditions spread rapidly in hospitals.
Especially in patients with weakened or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the daily routine of the hospital.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the caregivers wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are checked for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for curbing the formation or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the patients admitted and isolate MRSA-infected patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not as common in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the state health insurance company for this investigation.
Therefore, most cases would only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the Epidemiology Center.
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the drug can be formed, but this directive is not always adhered to by hospitals.
Among outpatients, or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling is even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz.
The disinfectants are saved
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to the other by nursing staff.
It is precisely for this reason that hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area as well.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient in the home hospitals.
The rooms are even often crowded, the beds lined up close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the financially less well-positioned hospitals, it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that almost favor the development of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes health insurance huge costs, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government program.
After initial signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made the prevention of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infection in hospitals one of its priorities.
Death manager wasn't drunk
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The resigned police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under the influence of drugs, Attila Morvai, the press spokeswoman for the Budapest public prosecutor's office, said on Friday after the official opinion on the case was presented.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he took the wheel.
The former police chief bogged into Kossuth Lajos street with his own car in the XXII district and crossed a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked location.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mildening circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, subordination .)
The pedestrian is killed after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the steering officer suffered a shock, after which he retired and requested retirement.
The Budapest prosecutor’s office has begun its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday, totalling EUR 400 million. The money is to go to education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy industry.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement of 100 million was signed earlier, the current agreement dealing with the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be spent on the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has allocated a total of EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later on in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be used in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
During the meeting, the subway line 4 was also mentioned.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, free of provision.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is looking at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who still buys the cheapest market in the EU, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly currently the most sought-after pavement for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, however, properties around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior will sooner or later also attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russian has more buyers.
The capital city of Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office spaces offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its best way to become one of Europe’s most attractive golfing paradises, attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons as well in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are already buying on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy property in Bulgaria are also looking for a change in their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are predominantly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or decayed homes for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication options are greatly written, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed in the top ten destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the aim of increasing value in the medium to long term.
However, real estate in the capital is constantly becoming more expensive, due to the ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been an annual price increase of 21 percent.
The price increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are consulting on the Bali roadmap, which sets the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
A fierce debate is currently underway between developed and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signalled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are willing to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on assistance to developing countries has also been reached.
The adjustment fund, which is subject to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be administered by a 16-member Council, which is expected to be part of the UN Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as outlined in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s commitment to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that by 2020, the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (based on 1990 levels), whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be achieved successfully. The Union would even be willing to advocate a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrialized countries in the world or developing countries are also willing to do their utmost to meet their commitments in a responsible manner.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the states that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, while the EU with its then 15 member states had already committed to a decrease of 8%.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a target that the country will certainly meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the international, with the latest Nobel Peace Prize awarded scientific climate change committee of the UN.
This would delay the emission reduction, and increasing the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2°C would be inevitable, resulting in extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British Army Advertises on YouTube
British army units have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The shots with miniature cameras attached to helmets are checked at the air base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are posted on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under the Defence Headquarters in the spring of 2007 to publish videos of Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Peace Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of the foreign operations.
Propaganda of this kind is almost free compared to conventional television ads, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur shots, which, in addition to the carefully processed, censored shots, also make it into the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, at most, the losses are talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, from the sites of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos shot in use have already been uploaded to the platform, but this "genus" has only recently been discovered by the British for themselves.
However, the Americans advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less life-threatening simulation.
Christmas celebration with tombola and pogatsche in the ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, is by no means comical: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a working conference where her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogasche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure Christmas mood with tombola or pushing into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held this year in the defense resort, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are striking the strings.
The 4.32 million Forint costly Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The main focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola draw.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the house of the State Judiciary Council (ILO), with concerts and a festive dinner.
The room rent was 1 million forint, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration, which is organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the responsible parties.
Why the suit?
The ILO building was open not only to the guests of the NFU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
Approximately 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], they were informed: There was no ball dress or suit obligation on the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour, and Self-Government are each preparing for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health is organizing the celebration for employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference at the end of the year.
One expects about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are hosted only with coffee and Pogatsche, so the celebration ends with 350,000 forint.
Minister of Self-Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply run into the hall of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas celebration in its own hall, which is expected to be attended by 436 employees.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 forints per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with a subsequent push.
Since the beginning of the term of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate each year in this way.
However, there will not be a proper party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture is inviting to a New Year’s Eve reception on January 20th, the Christmas celebration of the Ministry is this time out.
The one hundred guests are invited to Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the department, the expenses are measured at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
The receptions, which are held each year, traditionally begin with a brief speech by the minister and end with restrained snacks.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Foreign Ministry or the Ministry of Education.
Asked for the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given to the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which will be held at the Museum of Arts and Crafts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
On Friday, the League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions form their coordination committee for the indefinite strike that begins on Monday.
On Saturday a large protest assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work resignation begins.
It is expected that there will be strike-related, significant traffic impediments, since railway transport is almost completely discontinued, and also the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will strike until 1 p.m.
Details of Monday’s strike will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ Strike Committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large protest assembly will be held on Saturday, and from Monday on all organisations that have joined the strike will lay down work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act has not been defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call to strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it is only in the late evening hours, or even at midnight, that there will be a vote on the health insurance law.
The strikes starting on Monday will have to be expected to result in considerable traffic impediments: the railway workers are laying down their work indefinitely, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies stand still.
At the same time, there will be one-way roadblocks in many places.
The call to strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is updated on the league website.
Some organisations have announced indefinite strikes, while others are planning a temporary layoff.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railways M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of the VDSZSZ railways, although more and more people are travelling by train around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will strike from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA electricity and thermal energy unions will lay down work for four hours, and the teachers’ union has called for 2 or 2-8 hour strikes respectively.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes alternately across the country at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of the Trade Unions, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the league is that the government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and submit a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which is due from next year.
The third requirement is that the eligible occupational groups be granted access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer concerning the auxiliary lines submitted by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk represents "the intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is presumably aimed at provoking such a clash, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People in public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposition."
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favor extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "have seriously damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has been continuously booming, so that since summer 2007 several organisations called themselves "national self-defense associations" have been established.
"These groups are common in defining themselves as a civil organization, while openly bragging about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (catastrophe protection, national defense, preserving order), citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: all this is done according to that method which tries to disguise various political aspirations, based on the political and party-disgustingness of the population, as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association are therefore not only used to circumvent legal obstacles that could arise in the course of registration in court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard also represent a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, according to some ultranationalist politicians in certain neighbouring countries, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard is a confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region," he said.
From the research institute’s point of view, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an individual phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
The activities of the Hungarian Guard are reportedly comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the BNU.
Against the backdrop of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents as the occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization was "national protection".
In her opinion, for the past 17 years, a real "Gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria, but the state has remained deedless and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have sparked a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Given that the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma will also respond to the threats by organizing their own protection, the risk warning report of Political Capital states.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and should risk-changing trends be discernible, public opinion will be informed, as in the case by issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary holidays are regulated by law, so the practice of rearranging working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the coming year gives us fewer such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood by "holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and days off from work.
Working days are mostly church holidays, or are related to important historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are days free of work - the latter alone so that the New Year's Eve festivities can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The national holidays are March 15, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, the commemoration of the Revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August the founding of the state, on the 1st of May the work is celebrated, on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "workday postponement" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is ultimately to be worked out, is for many years determined by the Minister of Labour in his own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employers, public servants and civil servants alike.
Except only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on holidays.
Heuer the working order is only confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24 life here remains formally, since most take time balance for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the holidays specifically cancelled for it.
Next year, there will be more holidays in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer re-dispositions on working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a rest day.
The second re-disposition is related to the holiday on October 23rd: On Saturday, October 18th, you will have to work on Friday, October 24th in advance.
However, the end of the year will be completely in the sign of the holidays, after 24 December everything will stand still, even if New Year’s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to upset co-workers
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we don't notice anymore: they bring "color" into everyday life in the workplace.
The question is just whether to get used to these little inconveniences, or better take on the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstood, consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called," says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it right again, perhaps by calling the marketing department and repentantly confessing that you forgot to target the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the matter has been dismissed with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should think about how to give your colleagues truly unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrow something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s hardly anything more annoying than grabbing a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost pen found on a colleague’s desk?
Without questions, you should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has gone away.
So, don’t put envelopes or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more there when you need it urgently.
Talking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who with whom, what?
Where and why?
The information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues should not be tied to everyone’s nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and tells us his innermost secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to be silent like a grave, rather than aligning those who are not present at the moment, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Sick for no reason?
If you call in the office to report sick, citing tormenting headaches, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, indeferable completions, projects with fixed dates must now be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
Don’t play badly with your colleagues.
If you already know the day before that you will not be able to make it to the office the next day, or that something could come in between, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss will be confronted unexpectedly with the absence.
Sum, Kicking, Phone
You are just getting deeper into your work, but suddenly getting disturbed by the loud giggling of your colleagues?
Unintentionally listening to a phone call that you better not have heard?
One should not annoy colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which one conducts over their heads), cramping, constant scolding or nodling.
All of this can be very annoying, even if they aren’t really deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the others’ fault?
If a project is not finished on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, do not look to others to blame for your forgetfulness!
If possible, don’t talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or how to make up for the missed ones, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Workout pants and flaps: Comfortable for at home, but nothing has been lost in the office!
You shouldn’t even dress so casually if the workplace actually allowed it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Want to make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of every morning traffic jam.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The pace changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that sounds on mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene has not exactly spoiled us with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the home digital underground scene, slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even when the garage skirt with its guitar chick is back "in", the home electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Baláz’s Zságer started in Pécs, musicing himself in the band Yonderboi, before he began to walk his own path – perhaps because a guest house does not tolerate two pipers.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, he only made it when one had approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack into a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, the nearly only marketable trendsetter in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested if they liked to wear this brand too.
The band reacted as they should: with a new, even better album.
The new album titled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new paths for them, but the title already expresses a desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression stems from the time when Baláz’s Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but in addition to the essential character of the music, the louder guitar - corresponding to the zeitgeist and the trends - are the influences of rock'n'roll.
With these songs, singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere at the Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to a radio hit - the mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who has been sending pop music from early to late, has successively set the ears to listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the help of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
All right (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz’s Zságer: The term “shift music” doesn’t really mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercially and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but likewise they can only be produced for sale, which makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motif.
The listener’s readiness to receive works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Pop music has a wider tradition abroad, especially in the west of us.
Not only teenagers or twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively, because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling to see more and more coming to our concerts.
We have never composed for the market.
With us, music is not created for a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt at concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that in turn is only in the intangible changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed one thing: if you want to make it right for everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built his career more in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, apart from trying to interpret this into our music over and over again.
We see ourselves more as team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
Initially, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which was then supposed to be a drag horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgy and the slightly more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why she, what was the guiding principle?
The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of composing the choir of gifted soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was created - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later named "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls co-create it?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The chord sequence formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all happened practically at the outset and frighteningly spontaneously.
I remember I was quite electric back then, but it also needed the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, it seemed that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no role of their own, sing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on the back of the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing behind was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not consciously want to give them solo roles.
The point is also that one should forget one’s ego a little bit, forget who came from and where is going, we simply allow these particular wings, the wings of love to lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song arose.
hvg.hu: What was the most complex song?
Zs.: Nothing really happened in musical work, there were more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work for longer, but gradually everything came together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number on the new album?
B.S.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and even now that I have "released" the album.
Currently they are "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions for feelings of inferiority
Landless scammers
This is how his former employee Jerome Kerviel designates the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>ní banka.
Because of him, it was worth nearly five billion euros.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, and was certainly not incapable of it.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized in time the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He's rather mentally weak," was heard from the mouths of his superiors, who showed him to the police.
But according to the statements of Kerviels, published by the French media, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a person who had made a profit of 1.6 billion euros from his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros just at the time of the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first reports that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had disbursement problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and kept right.
By the end of the year, it had screwed up its profit to 1.6 billion euros.
“Even when I had earned the first half a billion, I didn’t know how to explain that,” Kerviel admits and continues to say that he definitely didn’t keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he forged documents so that he wouldn't be tricked.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the scenes, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk-Profit
Was he afraid to fly?
It's hardly.
"I thought she satisfied the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
“Even in my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigative officers.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
He made a lot of money with the shares of the alliance by betting half a billion euros on price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we leave you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew everything, or suspected it.
“As long as I made money, they closed their eyes.”
But then at the beginning of this year came the big blow.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get to him?
He suspiciously went on vacation.
“I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want to be looked at in the cards,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes, through which the Czech Republic can reach 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) over the next few years.
This is about half of the amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion kronor comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to allocate about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" program.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will go into transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money is increased according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to attract funds for innovative enterprises.
The aim is to raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
In the previous acquisition of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic is one of the least successful among the new accession countries so far.
Nicaraguan court upholds 20-year prison sentence for former president
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he had been convicted in 2003 for $100 million in financial fraud.
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda in the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state will come back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the news agency AP.
According to the chairman of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the detention officers whether to let Alemán sit his sentence at home or whether he has to go to jail.
A court proved four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund set up by Alemán to fund his election campaign in 2001.
The budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget this government has designed and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The current year was approved with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats) because it had been presented by Minister Sobotka (of that party), and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could therefore not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the proposal for distrust against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time around.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-regarded, yet highly significant law in all calm.
This is, in a way, paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is obscured by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they are paying more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past Social Democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of spending that is legally obligatory, not only on pensions, but also on social spending, which was decided by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third constraint is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, apart from income from taxes, levies and bank loans, spent additional sources of investment, often inconsiderable bonds through which they excessively indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have succeeded in paying off these debts through mass sale of shares of the energy and other power grids they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now this source has already dried up.
To the extent that we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
For some years now, like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a period of growth that the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is constantly proud of.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to get public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonably than our republic.
This is a huge disgrace, which is mainly attributable to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been superfluously inflated to a gigantic extent in recent years.
Even if it has succeeded in deleting some of the nonsense populist issues that were passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no postponement of the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, he will remain nothing but purely administered.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenues on pensions and social spending.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the expulsion of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion kronor for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent in the last ten years, which was only possible.
If we don’t really want to make politicians pure administrative officers, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, but aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take in taxes and fees, want to rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these enable a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
This means that more than $100 billion will reach the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed is auctioning $40 billion, another 24 making it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to prevent or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties in the economy, the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report for his clients.
“Central banks’ coordinated action has reduced the likelihood of a US recession from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of dollars to be lost.
“Central banks must have been really afraid of anything that can come after they decided to do this,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he continued.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly impacting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used when lending money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money despite the fact that central banks in the U.S., Canada and Britain had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
“This will have the same effect as a further interest rate drop,” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting, Reuters agency.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks contributes to the warming up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are unbelievable
Global climate change allegedly harms developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus reiterated the issue of global warming.
Criticism is now referring to the coming-to-end international UN conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book A Blue, Not a Green Planet, he argued that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric it accompanies and reality.
“The debate there is unstructured, it is a word firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed at the presentation of his book that his subject matter was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation, because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
So now interested parties can read his attitude undisturbed.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climate scientist, but he believes he has sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
He is, after all, an academic, able to understand and evaluate professional papers, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore not a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproven views, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against “reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield.”
Klaus had already spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver’s license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities will be able to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the roads without valid driving authorization after New Year’s Eve.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive did not exchange their driver’s license.
While small towns are reporting a sharp decline in interest in driving ticket exchanges, the offices of the capital are flooded with applications, and interest in the exchange has grown this week.
The city administration handles around 2,000 customers every day.
You have to wait for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver’s license.
The issuance of a new driving licence lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to make the required change by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license will face a fine from January.
The perpetrator pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also use it with a warning in the case of a breach.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even the one can be imposed by the community a penalty that does not drive at all.
He could face a penalty of up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry already called on the offices to exercise mildness and to impose a fine of at most 1,000 crowns.
According to the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand crowns.
The driver’s license is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
This is not an identity card that everyone, including a valid one, must have.
People who don’t want to drive should give up their driver’s license.
It is sufficient to take him to the competent municipality office or send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers will gradually have to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driver's licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court Reduces Penalties for Detectives Allied to Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, who are accused of doing joint business with David Berdych’s gang, were sentenced to 13 or 10 years in prison, respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced her sentence by one or two years respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years, respectively.
There is no possibility of appeal against today’s judgment, only revision in the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych himself is also charged in this case, he is first facing the judgment in the first instance.
In other trials, however, he had already received fines of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned for more.
A district court found 19 people guilty in January, mainly for involvement in robberies, the Higher Regional Court today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the charge from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police handed over information from police sources to criminals, including Berdych, covering various robberies and helping members of the gang to evade prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík with 30% of the prey.
The prosecution concerns crimes committed by the gangs from 1999 to 2001.
Especially for robberies, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for impropriety of office and unauthorized possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to the prosecution, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns through their robberies.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this case, courts found Berdych and a number of others guilty of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych’s vicinity have to answer in a different trial, other cases have not yet come to court.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody and are awaiting a final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have so far escaped the main trial.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, will demand compensation from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> 12 million crowns plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parental couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, therefore, completely disagrees with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dostál said after today's trial.
"But in order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the opposite side had to produce.
We will see if it has any meaning at all.
However, we insist that this should be in the range of hundreds of thousands for all together," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At first, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov family wanted one million crowns for every month that their biological daughter had not raised.
For Veleba, an opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol served as the basis for compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the children’s parents suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying strength and depth.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even if they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, are worse off with the aftermath of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening now, Veleba summarized the content.
On 9 December last year, Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> maternity hospital.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermáks in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the district captain of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina (Bohemian Moravian Heights) gave each family 100000 crowns as a substitute for expenses incurred by the fault of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law due to liability.
In case of doubt, they must use a reserve fund, only by way of exception they can apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low amounts of damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and ranged in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polivka overthrew his kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polivka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom of Wales".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, although he was the first to use the term "Walachian King", the project had built a team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in cooperation with the actor in many years of work.
Polivka did not take part in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client is likely to appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polivkas parasitically," Polivkas lawyer said after the trial.
Everyone in the words "Walachian Kingdom" just imagined this actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
“We have nearly 10 years of work behind us.
Fundraising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a dispute over money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it too.
They want to gain parasitic gain in our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polivka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But at that time this was not related to the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Walachian passports.
An originally fun action crystallized a business and an entrepreneurial activity, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polivka agreed to the use of his name and his signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> used only the mere idea that Polivka had made public in the program "Manege" for his entrepreneurial purposes.
“Polivka’s popularity has certainly helped the project of the Walachian kingdom,” the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> project and his team were intensely dedicated to it.
The co-operation of the parties now divided lasted until the year 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polivka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> have begun to accumulate, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected until Saint-Neverlein's Day".
At the suggestion of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková, she became the Queen’s mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed the lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> for the throne and half a princess.
From this a new king should emerge.
He did not want to reveal details and a date.
“We don’t want to hurry anything.
It was supposed to be something like the king's retreat in the Walachi.
The king was to be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Polívka can also sign up," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages shrinking
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much worthwhile, the quality of the gear shifting, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The combi called SW is a bit further away, and I just have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the too little headroom on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the combi is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly continue
I only go through the interior for a short time, so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a very successful design, where I only have objections because of the poor middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The side hold has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
Regarding the space supply, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body here.
The previously mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated in the combi.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the cargo space.
I have to describe it (also because of the foldable rear window) as very easily loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with holding belts, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and hold even heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table, it is 428 liters in the basic equipment, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is left behind by clearly noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when inviting a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the very flat loading space after the rear seats have been folded over or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 liters and an output of 88 kWp.
And honestly, this is what a 1600 cubic engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and moves well away.
If I compare him to his counterpart at <0xC5><0xA0>koda, which sometimes looks like his exhaust is clogged with a cloth, then I can only be thrilled with him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 gasoline engine at the amount of 329900 crowns is still high.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car hits again with 80,000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper release, electric windows in the rear and...
Thus, the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but once you calculate the extra equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So all that remains is the decision on which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, causing local fears about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has hitherto encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original residents increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates aptly the case of North Kent, where the clashes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually escalating.
Disputes, harassment and bullying among students have shifted to relationships between parents.
The situation has already evolved to such an extent that police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The defendant defended herself with the boy insulting her with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene after an attack by two minor girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“As we went home, a boy climbed on a bushy and spit on us.
When I told him to quit, he blamed apples and pears on us and then bared his buttocks,” a mother of Slovakian students told The Times.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned testify that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here looking for work.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it will be fulfilled if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters who offer pizza, ice cream and tempting cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana was once a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, and the wide boulevards were driven by cars, one of the iconic symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the Fifties still drive around in Havana today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Havanna, especially its oldest part, may have fallen sharply, nowhere in the vicinity can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are just being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a bite that is unique in the world and especially attracts railroad lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow lanes to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see nice and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
The most important places do not allow the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you no longer have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
All that remains to be mentioned is that the above-mentioned property of Hemingways has a museum whose visit should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities accumulated fertile soil, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense growth.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was shot there.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought her the trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied in the adorable beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in the last four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road that would have connected the area to the rest of the country in the 1950s.
This insulation contributed to the fact that it was left unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon to spend in Trinidad, it’s worth visiting interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the “Valley of Sugar Mills”.
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after dark, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Certainly this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading there from Guantánamo have to overcome high and rugged mountains and pass through a landscape barely touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba, thanks to its untouched nature, has been included in UNESCO’s World Heritage List.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where stands the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the pork bay and the island of Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, you could write many pages.
As they say, it is better to look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say.
Insufficient troops and lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not go according to their expectations, as the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further co-ordination plans among allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO units to increase activity, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
“In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable residents to start economic development and security themselves,” said Des Browne, British Minister of Defense, to the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the American army.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop said the same.
"I am not pleased with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s too little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has been a debate among the participating countries as to whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany was criticized for passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the combat demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country,” Gates said.
The British tabloid newspaper "Sun" this week called the German soldiers a lazy fur.
"Afghan non-struer uncovered: The Germans make games while our boys fight," the Sun wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German picture newspaper went on to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit during a rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
Every Czech has a national debt of 84,000 crowns.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe itself 159.2 billion cones this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
As a result, in the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the state debts from the beginning of October.
Every Czech has a debt of 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state indebted by more than 111 billion kroner.
“So far, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not be crossing the one trillion crown limit until 2009.
Next year’s debt is expected to move between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, said: "We could reach a trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it shows that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, that could last until 2010.
But I don’t expect such a change,” he remarked.
Debt grows
The state debt comes from the debts of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
Government debt is financed through treasury orders, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, European Investment Bank bonds.
Domestic government debt has risen to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The foreign debt of the state rose by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
“Over the course of the year, total debt increased by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is recorded especially in the bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad for debt to rise, but on the other hand it shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The 2007 financing strategy and government debt management show that the government had planned to receive 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kronor, thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, the maximum planned funding for the consolidation agency amounts to 13.3 billion kroner, a reserve of ten billion kroner for pension payments, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion kroner and instalments for bonds with the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was brought before a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening and subsequently expelled.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old pupils to name a teddy bear Mohammed, despite the fact that any portrayal of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of pupils complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher, who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum, was picked up at home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, school principal Robert Boules reports.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first names.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear himself did not wear a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the portrayal of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knows her well, and she would never have done anything with which she might be too close to a religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe them as being very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks about religion in the class.
It should be borne in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given second name in the United Kingdom, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of honor to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna on Wednesday.
At the end of the failure
Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is unfortunate that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to meet their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, suggesting that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian intermediary Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final negotiating session since the troika had received a mandate from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation contract to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, insisted on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains advocate for a negotiated solution, a mutually agreed solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN-administered Kosovo, Western countries consider EU-supervised independence the only solution with the future.
Pristina is willing to proclaim these unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favor.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations have been held at the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the autonomy plan proposed by Belgrade belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise should always be sought, warning the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade says it particularly favors a "domino effect" in a region that has been so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be made solely and solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally holds a veto.
Kosovo's Parliament Will Have the Last Word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that the Kosovo parliament would have the last word on status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would take place in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush elicits agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had convened under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the peace roadmap that they had agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authority under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty that will clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This designation encompasses the three major problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians mainly revolve around: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the 1948 conflict, which lies in the present-day state of Israel.
After the American president took the floor, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, the water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he pledged that the upcoming ceasefire negotiations should be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which exist side by side by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received an assurance in this sense from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has set in motion a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi Arabian prince says in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-speaking daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors face each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel in the direction of Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no mission, but was on police, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a police spokesman said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without approval, i.e. not released for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two teenagers without a helmet, hit at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it disregarded its precedence from the right, a police officer continued.
The alcohol control carried out on the passengers in the vehicle is very negative.
The condition of the trolley (beaded fender, split windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary personal murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main department of public safety of Val-d<0x60>Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor declared that she would exclude the responsibility of the police officers to investigate the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, who were heard Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a sort of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were obduced yesterday.
What happened afterwards?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel a rumor quickly made the round, according to which the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, and that without providing help to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious mistakes in this regard.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires further investigation, and in which very careful action is needed.
Libération met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who was a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely upset policeman hanging.
Two others tried to revive one of the youngsters, the fourth on the phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the incident and, it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers of colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident were taken in the car.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescuers arrived about twenty minutes after the police officers left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces did not help the young people.
First aid has been provided to these young people.
The fire brigade arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed.
Tension is rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken within the framework of the state of emergency were injured in the city of Lahore in the eastern part of the country by tear gas grenades deployed there by law enforcement.
They then threw stones with which they hurt the policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily detained.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were temporarily detained.
In Islamabad, lawyers for the Supreme Court’s lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations were held in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyers’ movement received Monday the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who had spoken out against the state of emergency, and to those who had sworn an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
He had to take a position in the following days on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in a direct election on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
Everything we represent is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s decisions, the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s pledge to deliver the command over the army and become a civilian president has ceased to apply since the invocation of the state of emergency, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to hand over his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The deputy minister of information has also confirmed that the elections of January could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army leader.
More than one-third of pregnancies are still unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law that allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of female pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, however, the liberalization of contraception has enabled better control of fertility.
Nowadays, eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
In one in five couples, even calculated accurately on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repairs at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools crafted by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Wednesday when the astronauts had discharged the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is expected to soon be accommodated by European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-tonne module for power generation via solar panels already on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began restructuring the solar panels of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable over a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to further damage the collector.
The astronauts, who originally left the space shuttle Discovery for a control tour and then repaired another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resilient, very skillful, he has a well-developed torso and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was thus selected to operate the injured solar panel.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and attached some sort of rail to the damaged site.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey club, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, had been designed and engineered by the astronauts aboard the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the collector to be fully unfolded before counting down his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery, expected to begin their return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counter the A400M lags, the share EADS is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris stock exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007, referring to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delayed the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, including more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further detail.
The group also states that the estimate of the new costs is related to the six-month lag.
As a reminder, the business performance of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Originally, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Choosing the Status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting in the counting of the ballot boxes: the mass of Russians will decide for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her pursuit of stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters broadcast on public channels, which has already been recorded, but the contents of which are kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kreml party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, when the president received the foreign ambassadors, he was content to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without scams, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have lost their way.
She denounces an election campaign plagued by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Jeltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparovder had been sentenced to five days in prison for illicit demonstrations, according to his lawyer still banning visits.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two far-reaching questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper yesterday announced the date of the first round of presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and the almighty party United Russia, who will elect the government and president?
Whatever it is, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the power so far will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their destiny, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Levada Center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further back: bourgeois society has evolved very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has re-attached to the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so, since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility they have briefly exposed after the disintegration of the USSR.
Why think about it for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all strata of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional chairmen) lead the local election lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why think for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why replace them?
A heavy souvenir
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed over a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. at the inquiry of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states charged with their administration – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health status of forced laborers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental impairment of some deportation victims.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest, thus paving the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees work on tens of thousands of personal enquiries.
Nevertheless, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
Nothing fundamentally new can be expected in these documents, said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India are seeking a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), with mutual trade between India and Europe already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economies and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued. The Asian and European giants exchange goods worth 47 billion euros annually and services worth 10 billion euros, had this week declared Daniéle Smadja, president of the deputy of the European Commission in New Delhi, and regrets that the mutual trade has not yet exploited the potential of the European Commission at the end of the week.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern, offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern about curbing the current recurring concern about lending conditions, announcing an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer of unusual maturity.
In order to ease the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly difficult at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organize their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of their savings deposits during the preservation phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of a five-week notice in the form of an open-market.
The bank further explains that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation on December 6 at 12.15 GMT, at the real estate tax rate and only until January 10.
This is apparently the first time that BoE has been running liquidity in an open market operation for five weeks.
This is usually done for a week.
BoE adds in its notice that it is prepared to take further action to maintain the day-to-day interest rates of interbank loans at their base rate.
The interbank interest rate varied from day to day on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate has risen to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the start of the financial crisis last summer, the sums circulated by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that had prevented banks from using them.
According to some rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound price in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums circulated by the European Central Bank at more favourable rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, created in the context of a socialist niche (session on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), indicated about ten measures that had been adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, the majority of which were 50% for employment allowance, for the re-introduction of the floating TIPP, for a transport check or for the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against examining the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some fierce arguments between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s television post on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present all of their proposals as an amendment to the bill on the correction of finances, which had been examined by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
“It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, no more and no less, as a role model for the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, in his capacity as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also taken care of the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
C3’s Charlie Jones, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he’s ever attended, says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as the marketplace and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We negotiated mt the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
“Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration,” continues Charlie Jones.
“Luckily, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grand Park Chicago, having profiled itself in the world of the festival together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events generated $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax days in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours is more likely to take place on urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, while simultaneously conveying the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban one in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with joy,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to host a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s reception capacity is “very large,” roughly the 80,000 people attending the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations were sent to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who won the Top Independent Promoter Award for the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It’s not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no lesser than the Terminator is against it.
These lock-in attempts are among the delegate tasks.
A politically "healthy mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the governor?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are cheap, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones you think are the best,” he says.
Run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, at the moment, the introduction of the cinema there is a top priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At every festival on the west coast, although Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The Dark Age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be unveiled at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market ahead of an end-year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in view of the upcoming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, December on the stock market is usually accompanied by a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not when serious tensions determine current market developments
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they note that the exchange rate is determined by the liquidity of the market and the market participants, who mainly invest in pension funds due to the lack of secure equity funds, which is heavily affected by the upward trend towards high-income assets.
Accordingly, according to these experts, the stock market will have a rather lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the U.S. central bank, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the rise in crude oil prices and the risk of rising inflation rates.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The odds are not very good, assures the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak on November 8 of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with nearly 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of investment funds and the traditional pension fund subsidy made each year around this time.
Nevertheless, the expert stresses that this year things could develop somewhat differently; mainly due to the end-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the Bridge Day to the Day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, whose scales depended on the consequences of the U.S. mortgage market crisis.
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the choice of the values to push the Ibex to new heights.
Solana of Intermoney says the big values are in its turn this year.
Among the value winners, the expert would include the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be accompanied by the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
ACS has been on track in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, according to the expert.
Regarding the increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine market events in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December showed only two falling price trends.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this drove the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real year-end rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 picked up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a 6.68% price increase.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (the Ibex increases by 8.36% since January) and also a final yearly rally will be revealed.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economical regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular as the first banking group represents the leap to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 20.30h and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The Bank’s ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement in which 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturdays and open for it on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for the clientele.
Whether further banks will join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening hours, will depend on the experience values of Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular is pursuing with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, due to their location, can capture the lustful clientele of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time adjusting them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of the opening hours will be combined with a new room design of the stores, which is characterized by a more current, colorful design.
The responsible banking representative <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera assured that the restructuring did not require major investment, but was accompanied by an increased recruitment, as a branch now needed not six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of the Bravo Murillo, O’Donell and Gran Vía roads have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax branches, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to represent competition for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally reached an agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time, overtaking its rival Antena 3.
We made it.
With this sentence, Telecinco’s managing director, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the close of the stock market. The station he led had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that’s exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had less losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento only having a 13% stake.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value amounting to 2,193.46 million is half.
On the other hand, the market value of other publicly traded communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (editor of Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be inferred from the fact that they are two similar companies, according to Vasile.
The question remains unclear to what extent we can actually act on the stock market, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first TV channel this year with more than 1,000 million gross revenues from advertising, assured Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business was only up 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco’s better stock market performance is the high payout ratio that the company has had up to now: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría instigated a 100 percent dividend distribution.
Vasile assured, however, that the ratio after the purchase of 33% of Endemol’s shares, with Mediaset as its parent company, could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay off at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated significantly more so far.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already increased by purchasing 33% of Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its Telecinco profit calculation by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.

Congress agrees with the MIFID directive, which came into force on November 1.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which ended its meeting today with the congressional decision in the Senate on the supplementary/amendment amendments pertaining to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law, with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
Representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of congress and senators, who in their negotiations and voting had the goal of establishing the best possible regulation that ensures the safety of investors and regulates individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market event.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, the MIFID, which re-enacts the Investment Services Regulation, aims to improve investor protection, increase the control of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new directive enables financial advice to be offered to both specialized companies and natural or legal persons and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services undertakings (ESIS), the consultancy undertakings that merge with securities investment and brokerage firms.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the regulated circulating markets will be added the multilateral systems of the transaction of securities and the systems for the internationalization of trade orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic players.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the priorities of their company profile, the confrontation and the ways of dealing with risks in the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The congressional economic commission subsequently envisaged further changes, with the decision that the securities bond must now be considered a complex financial instrument for the investor due to its high degree of risk, confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of areas of work for graduated economists was used; 30 years after the 1977 regulation, which restricted the areas of work reserved for economists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, has established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on an external account, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and customer acquisition at the same time several investment companies.
The Harmonized Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose five tenths in November to now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare local and quality to US products by publishing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared prematurely by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) cautioned that the indicator prematurely determined only serves as a guideline and therefore does not have to agree with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economics and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November is a temporary development; at the same time, it assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the congressional building that even if the current number is not good, Spain’s inflation difference to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economics and Finance announced in light of the forecast released today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock to earn more than 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock’s stocks have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the British central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year due to the crisis, and they are now only <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to €16,800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets were record <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a sum that dropped significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and despite the government’s 100% assurance that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue the group under the brand name Virgin Money after the acquisition, will need to earn about a quarter of the UK banks’ revenues from the investments in the next three years to acquire exactly that <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion that is still needed to achieve its target of $30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 million (approximately €70 million) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred tenderer to drive it out of bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana Arrested on Suspicion of Participation in Urban Corruption
The Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the municipality of Murcia, Totano (Partido Popular), on the grounds of the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Party and then chairman of the municipality of Totana, last May, and could, according to information from the radio station Cadena SER, be the original drafter of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales, was arrested when leaving the residence of his client due to important burdensome documents that are supposed to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report the alleged contract payments of Morales to a Galician construction company, which envisaged the conclusion of an urban contract, in which the construction of a 200 hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in detention.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE’s candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, to Congress.
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, accordingly he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory of the Socialists, take over the office of congressional president.
For example, PSOE organization secretary José Blanco and Bono announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party’s headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the Mancha-born politician would appear to run for the party as the chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as congressional president, who announced on November 15 that he would no longer compete in the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead devote himself to climate action in the university field.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the president has been continually pushing for his return to political action.
Moreover, he pointed out that, as with the appointment of the Vice-President for Economy, the party did not want to deprive citizens of who would assume the post of congressional president in the event of an election victory, and called this an act of transparency.
If he should actually take office, he hopes to transform the chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or scream, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time, the impression is gained that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak calmly and calmly is the Congress; so the President of the Government in the Senate has been interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work, indicating that he did not want to make it appear that he had already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to relentless criticism of both climate change skeptics and those who are putting a social and political debate at the forefront of climate change, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in need of explanations regarding the actions, or non-actions, of his government, which has played a decisive role in making Spain at the forefront of the countries within the EU that have least met the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the ones responsible for failing to comply with the guidelines on which sectors this is due, and why did not his government, which proposed the treaty with the planet, halt this development?
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he envisages against climate change without hesitation.
Which companies will be affected, what behaviour of citizens is to be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures must be carried out and what the economic consequences are.
More specifically, who will have to sacrifice themselves and pay for the saving of the planet.
However, there have and will be no such explanations in the future.
Especially because it’s about paying and paying.
The measures that can actually be used against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE appeared Zapatero so dangerous in terms of electoral strategy that he was forced to withdraw the proposal again.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician otherwise suited for election campaigns does not have to speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of embellishing the meetings and inspiring others with his meekness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a compartment.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, which belongs to Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, and also the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor’s office and a hotel contractor were detained on suspicion of urban infractions, according to investigations today.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is until now, surrounded by numerous agents, who had also arrived with the city administration and the municipal construction management of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the arrests already took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in which it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of unexploited construction land for urban projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria was to be redesigned. This was to be built on the property illegally 4000 apartments after the local administration had constructed it during the last Legituro.
In addition, two other people were not directly arrested, but were subject to an investigation, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six detainees were presented to the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the investigation is also against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales.
In addition, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend, residing in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigran (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is said to have been a subgroup of Nuaria and received the lubricating money.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives in addition to the arrests carried out eleven further searches, most of them in companies that were directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farm, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group has been commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the village belonging to Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana to be rebuilt, with the aim of realizing a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking lots of the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, which specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of components.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the commentary published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the head of the PISA study), which comments on the commentary published in the same newspaper, on November 18, coincidentally on that day, the issue of which contained the criticism of Blackburn’s book.
The content of the subject of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school student who quoted in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsches.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Educational Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, urged the teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and suggested that Plato’s teaching be removed from the sub-level curricula for philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, punishable by six months in prison.
However, if you steal a music business under the value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious dispute will result in a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange will result in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered to be less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyrighted films, whose authorization has not taken place by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than distribution of pornographic footage to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague is right, someone has pretty much screwed his demands up.

My GP gives me one of his long, strange research articles titled: Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings resulting from the monthly salary payment are dependent on the salary of colleagues.
The study was made using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest issue of the science journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn Brain Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his co-player failed, on the other hand.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were correct with their response and thus also received the same level; but when one of them received twice as much, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure if it really takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
For eight years now, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the criminals of the Balkan Wars. Her seat is in the prosecution office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and a laughing eye, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed - namely former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic remain on the free foot.
Their names are on the list, which the Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach used as a template for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that pursues the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York at the pace of a political thriller with their intention to try to track down the escaped criminals and undermine the respective government.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which depends on various factors, such as age, gender, date of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one has to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Auto insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract stating that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to provide the corresponding compensation amount in case of damages.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance consisting of several factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that in the event of a higher risk of accidents, higher contributions will also be due.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women have to make fewer contributions, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same is true for married persons, since according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to have fewer accidents than single persons.
The benefits attributed to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also thoroughly study the situation in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
At this point, we now list the most important points to consider when choosing an insurance in order to make not only a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
Those under 25 years of age encounter numerous obstacles when choosing a low-priced insurance, such as the low driving practice and the young driving license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance coverage to take out full insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full insurance with deductible, so that while the benefits of a full insurance are covered, they are offered at a low price.
This type of contract involves the customer having to pay part of the amount incurred by the damage themselves.
The amount is determined before the contract is concluded and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s principal representative at First Europa, an online insurance brokerage company.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage incurred on his own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under the age of 25, it is up to you to reduce insurance costs; this increases your credit by trying to drive cautiously and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction of the basic rate at the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in said tariff.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a high-yield year behind it can afford to increase bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract, as the accident rate drops as driving practice increases.
Thus, it is most sensible to opt for full insurance with self-deductibility.
Normally, young people cannot take advantage of their previous experience, either in the event of an accident or at the time of driving, explains the Spanish director of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the beginner’s fear has been dropped.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out a full insurance policy; of course only if the financial situation of the appropriate person also allows.
On the part of the insurers, couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full insurance insurance with self-deductible (for an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which is only used for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to set up a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For retirees it is advisable to take out a full insurance with self-deductible (for an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only applies with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accidental damage, but also because it carries high costs that require a thorough selection to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes for the point for the eighth final in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point they lack in San Siro next Tuesday to reach their respective goals before the final of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, as it decides on their participation with the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needed another one to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points did not catch the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D games will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where they will fight for the first time in the 13th semi-final to enter the final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be completed before all the others and the draw at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the all-anticipated result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home, the Keltic Glasgow knows that they would be group first in the event of a victory and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan’s team could be defeated even in a defeat by FC Shakhtar, but he shouldn’t rely too much on such circumstances, as the Ukrainians have the right to take part with nine points of equals; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
So the Milanese will try to avoid the Scots the evening, hoping to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after being defeated in the previous season by a goal of Kaka in the postseason (1-0) and by a zero-to-zero draw in the foreplay.
While FC Shakhtar is awaiting Rossoneri’s victory, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the eighth final and their UEFA membership will depend on their victory and a defeat for Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of his lower standings and without the prospect of continuing to compete in the biggest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could reach third place by winning and thus play with UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour after the band disbanded in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, before the eyes of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the mood in the band was reconstituted.
Around 20,000 people were able to witness the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video of the band's history, which had caused furore at the end of the 1990s, was shown.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which will be released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on stage, which Posh Spice's husband, English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the crowds that sparked the GM Palace, even though the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the preceding days.
During the preparations for the Schow, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star had not seen our wardrobe once, so I’m really curious what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements resulted in the dissolution of the group two years later, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that’s why I was thinking why not, so I’m glad I made that decision,” Chisholm commented on the separation of the band that had caused it nine years ago.
The singer also announced that the disputes had been resolved and that everyone liked each other again.
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls’ last joint appearance in 1998.
First of all, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special engine.
Upon arriving at the airport, the band was greeted by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will next perform in California, San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will be on stage in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute rages between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe being impaired.
Most of Russia’s natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are conducted through Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be charged more because the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," Ukraine's economic minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit charges [to Western Europe] over Ukraine.”
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This resulted in a drop in exports to Western Europe, which drastically pushed prices up.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the world’s largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS “must monitor foreign workers”
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of chief financial inspector Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish state health service does not have any precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were performed correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial inspector examined personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road vehicle was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared on a video broadcast at the Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in Britain.
The State Health Service is expected to conduct pre-employment checks to ensure that foreign employees have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal record records, the agency does not have the authority to obtain this information outside the UK.
The chief auditor’s report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should pick up guidelines from the criminal record excerpt that helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these checks in some personnel records, they were not routinely performed," the report said.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigative guidelines to a high degree before hiring, but added, “Our report identifies areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information is available about the number of foreign health care workers.”
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was “extremely unlikely” that investigations ahead of hiring potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
“The report says that current NHS Scotland pre-employment tests work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide,” he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards have problems identifying those employees who are on leave indefinitely.
The investigation further found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were predominantly followed.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment controls for foreign staff in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was my concern to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on pre-employment control investigations by all staff, including those from abroad, whose release is planned next month.
Joy Division Dominates Film Awards Ceremony
Control, the film biography about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including for best film.

Nevertheless, he has won two awards to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, most likely known so far for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best directorial debut.
Rock music was the center of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer received the award for Best Documentary.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my type of man, a great actor of his time, I’m really honored.”
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as on clergy and security forces.
State television from the world’s largest oil exporter said one of the cells planned to smuggle rockets.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-man rapid response force to protect facilities after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an interior ministerial statement, says 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell run by a “missile expert” who illegally immigrated into the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees were reportedly planning to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis striving for Iraq to join al-Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-backed Shia Muslim government, which the hardliners consider to be heresy among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clerics in Saudi Arabia to work in collaboration with authorities in supporting the royal family policy that dominates the government.
The militias – accompanied by calls by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government – are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very great effort by the security forces over the past... five months," a spokesman for the interior ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a 16-person "media cell" from Medina aimed at promoting "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among the detainees were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a glimpse of the future of the Earth
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit show that the planet resembles a remote twin of the Earth even more than previously known.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is somewhat closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere due to sunlight, and a slower rotational rate, Venus embarked on a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express space probe, which has been investigating the plant for a year, offer a sobering look at how the Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: “It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise pretty similar.”
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario where Venus started billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Uranium" confiscated by police
A kilo of radioactive material, enriched uranium reportedly, was confiscated yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican presidential candidate ultimately agreed to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time accurately reflected the state of the Republican party, which is emerging in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with selecting YouTube clips to be shown to the prospective candidates.
However, in the first half-hour of the debate, the longest one devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The issue is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed peaks of approval as the candidates spoke strictly over the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who has pushed forward in the decisive polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation of having been lenient about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two particularly divisively questioned whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to rethink this issue.
Neither of the two men have serious nomination opportunities, but they both stay in the race, perhaps because they’ve worked harder on immigration than others.
At least in the area of immigration, candidates generally share the same views: sharper borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This theme, along with fears about poisonous toys from China or other worries about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now, contrary to all expectations, in first place in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was urged to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul’s recent donation successes and his applause storms in Wednesday’s debate.
These two are shot up out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about America’s greatness and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No noble titles appear to have been sold, no Parisian politician paid hotel bills, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has concealed donations to the British ruling Labour Party over more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something that would have done well without the competitive Gordon Brown.
When two months ago the prime minister withdrew the demand for an election, insulting the intelligence of the British in a foolish way by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp-minded representative chairman of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once dreaded Brown from Stalin has evolved into Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a beaten bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have raised corporate associations against the government.
The tax authorities’ loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative punches.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: being minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary General (and her former Chief Executive Officer) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown irrevocably breaks out in the direction of leaving.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it impossible to govern.
People don’t trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for long, this postponement is over: the public service is beginning to leak; the cabinet ministers are beginning to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In one way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-in-chief.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax filings, for example, are linked to decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's misfortune -- as in the long "money for nobles" investigation of political party funding -- voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown’s situation isn’t as bad as it looks
The faults are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one has died, or been completely defrauded.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s, of course, always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation is a good example.
The garboeske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew of Abraham’s agreement, but doesn’t say it’s illegal, will have to ask himself some questions, of course; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s main financial investor, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by grasping a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - to make the measure full, of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be drawn from" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it is a matter for the police.
Other than that, there are other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding something to be a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life that has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
That would require Labour hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through undisputed righteousness and solid competence.
Map sharks
Is the credit crisis affecting America’s credit card market?
If there is blood in the water, it is only natural that back fins swirl excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is hurting, the predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion from underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both depreciation and default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or are more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it took a $1.4 billion fee levy from its American consumer finance, partly because of the weakness of credit card holders.
It is too early to panic.
Losses and losses are still low.
According to Moody, the third-quarter leaking rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in U.S. private bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to an abrupt fall of bankruptcy claims, which in turn accounted for a large part of the credit card losses; the number of registrations (and thus default fees) would rise again, whether or not the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate.
The industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is fairly strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the volumes of spending for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to borrow credit card debt now that home loans are drying up.
However, card issuers look at the flow of money rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
They can even be beneficial for the card issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates drop when the real estate is worth less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
“We won’t wake up one day and completely reassess the loans,” said Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial adviser.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are considerably more real.
If lower home prices and credit cuts push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers due to face trial for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their claims to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent for seven cases of telecommunication fraud for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich himself at the expense of their employer.
The proceedings were scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings lasting two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation that began after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally filed against them in 2002 pointed to Fastow’s being the target of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to hide a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron schemes that helped tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely defended Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastov and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others sanctioned about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastov pleaded guilty to conspiracy on two charges for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison term in Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on a $1 million bail, which required them to live in the United States in anticipation of court proceedings.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh largest company, collapsed in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of dollars in debt or make weakening businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than two billion dollars in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling faces a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges became void after he died of heart disease last year.
Not at the bottom in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is small money for some of the rich Russians.
“It can accommodate up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires Exhibition, a four-day orgy of showcased consumption held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had built stalls, hoping to interest newly funded Russians in everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-coated car grilles that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the nearest stand.
“That’s a nice car, but it’s cash compared to us,” he said.
After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be as flooded with money as Dallas in its splendid times.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went in crowds to Europe where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflighters of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians stand out as the most visible generous money issuers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, luxury industry conference Donatella Versace, Tom Ford, and LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault attracted ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who own a total of 282 billion dollars, according to Forbes’ list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 second-class Russian millionaires, worth $670 billion in total, according to a study on private wealth development in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived under the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian retailer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women are all well cared for and men are all worth a fortune."
As they walk through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, refer to themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I’ve been looking for the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in jam for several hours to visit a sturdy warehouse that impeccably places Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, bespoke billiard tables, and appartments in Dubai.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotically sitting at a stand at the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is old by Russian standards) have already moved from large-track logos to the kind of sober brands with limited volumes that would not market at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, were pushing through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company had sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer demands, said he had sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which resemble interconnected chain tires, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-time replacement.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife’s face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on those wheels,” Karapetian said.
"He'll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not currently express much exclusivity, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red phone cells that were stuffed with piles of fake million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passers stopped to throw around the piles of money, mobile phone photos, while they leaned back in the midst of substitute wealth, getting snapped by friends, or just plugging in a few millions.
“See, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev said.
Surgery suspected in New Jersey death
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance stopped two doors further down West Scott Avenue on the white Cape Cod.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another.
“Then I saw the medical corpse watcher’s van approaching,” said Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, on Wednesday.
“That was the point when I knew someone had died.”
The deputies learned that the dead Ms. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxocological investigations, the results of which might not be available for weeks, will help clear up a mysterious death that sent a grief through the Newark police leadership.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hard-working and persistent,” McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“She was my pitbull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
“That’s one of the ways,” Mrs. Walsh said.
“This is an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the ground.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro’s house, where a withered rose shrub stands in the scarce front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in groceries and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led into the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find himself in the provincial and tough political culture in his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes Central Bank Will Lower Interest Lead to Rise in World Stock Markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets by further interest rate cuts were strengthened by appeasing comments from the vice-chairman of the U.S. Central Bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the head of the central bank, said policy must respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the continued pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure distressing markets in the face of signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turmoil had “partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October.”
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening of financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were picked up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilize lending conditions with new capital injections into US markets and potential further interest rate cuts.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street in the face of further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that U.S. real estate sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost-cutting measure to compensate for major losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 Index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of UK standard values.
Germany’s Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for a three-month European Central Bank guarantee auction granted to European commercial banks was lent to a notable 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and feed further capital into the money markets in London rose as the three-month "Libor" borrowing rates between U.K. banks rose at 6.59 percent to their peak since late September, after a steady increase since November 21.
England faces decision on Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara statements
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who is going to beat the 6th for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election, on call, at least under this particular title, is here to help head coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide on this, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, gradually fills up with applications for national electoral offices, if not for part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth bat position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly unfair.
It’s never easy to pinpoint exactly what allows a person to reach the top of their professions, while no one else never gets above the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in cricket, where selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time to climb Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good grades who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can tell what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or sink.
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decisions, but chances have that too.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain’s eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a racket player must get regular chances on order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, for example, when James Anderson, who appears to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind taps into the nets.
Anderson took 32 top-notch wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same humble average, but both had their highlights and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough to a major test cricket player and who, despite scoring a double-hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion in the course of today’s network session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah’s greater experience about Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
Shah speaks for his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 top-notch hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22, and an excellent record against turned ball.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a Middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the pickers as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing from his beating, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has shoveled joy of life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket court and his stance away from it was brought to the point when he recently overtook a four-wheel drive vehicle at an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone (of course also sponsored place) out and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from afar, and enthusiastically say, “Did you see this?”
Bopara is a much better field player, he tapers his middle speed with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
I’m inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn’t mean that Shah may not be doing well if, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he’s the one who’s going to play here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work - and to Fight Al-Qaeda
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others hoping that the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now.”
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,” he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he was unable to renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local US-backed militia helped drive al-Qaeda out of its bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been driven out of his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand grenade attack after calling on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my and my boys’ support.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obedi, 62.
Many said they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop increase and the growth of local “citizens affected” armed and in cooperation with the U.S. military defending their neighborhoods.
But more spoke of having been forced home by visa problems and drying up funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled from the sectarian death squads in the country.
“We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged Iraqis to no longer give visas to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni retiree said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have diminished.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one area of education, Saarland has the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the 50th time, I told a non-Saarland that we are not French" - this slogan placates the smallest state ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which ranks fifth in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economics in Cologne (IW).
By tradition, universities are already cooperating closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
However, the Saarland also brings in an above-average number to the universities - many of them without a high school degree.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at IW.
More than one in five young people acquires their qualification to study at a vocational school, making the Saarland more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training opportunities are also expanded comparatively strongly.
Based on the population, dual study programmes are the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"At the general education schools, after the first Pisa study, we have initiated many reforms," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
For the children to start learning earlier, the last daycare year is free of charge - a model that is now being copied by other federal states.
Whether the performance of the students will improve sustainably, will only be shown by future comparative studies.
At Pisa 2003, the share of risk pupils declined from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as strongly as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better at calculating.
And to the dismay of the Saar countries, foreign language skills are not measured in Pisa - in this area you could otherwise score.
Because the language of the neighbors is obligatory at high schools - even if the Saar countries are not French.
Chávez is changing the clocks.
In Venezuela, watches will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets the clocks in the South American country turn back by half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez becomes a joke figure in Spain.
According to the Venezuelan Official Journal, a new law stipulates that the clocks will be set to world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S.-hostile Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by imposing the United States on the world’s division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, Chavez announced on Wednesday (local time) due to a hostage affair the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia.
The left nationalist said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not maintain relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my dignity alone," said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country must vote on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which were about the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spowed Venezuela in the face" with his decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain, Chávez is on everyone’s lips.
A new mobile phone ringtone is causing fury in the country: "Why don't you keep your mouth shut" is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet.
He was spoken to by Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed at the recent Ibero-America summit by the constant interlude of the left populist and who had spoken to him.
Germans threaten 2007 wage minus
Despite the strong economy, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts cited a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the VAT increase and the price increases in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild"-Zeitung.
Employees could also face new burdens on unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not again be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and petroleum products drove the inflation rate to its highest in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0% year-on-year.
Venus is the Earth's twin
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has detected lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbines at the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe Venus Express has provided the evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus shoots at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles reports in the science magazine Nature.
According to the famous "Ursuppen-Theory", lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is probably hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, temperatures sometimes of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the Earth’s devil twin, but she’s a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, has undertaken such a completely different development is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as no spacecraft had been on their way to exploring this planet since the early 1990s.
The latest research, now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underscores the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, the researchers believe.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with the Earth are greater than initially assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud gust at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the Sun in just under 225 days.
But he turns much slower about himself: a Venus day lasts 243 earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
Both accumulated water that remained in oceans on Earth, but lost to space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for their attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is worried about Germany’s reputation and has called on the large coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took protection from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not departed from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, lamented the Union's "showcase policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery office, there was severe irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only invited the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from SPIEGEL also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China rejects when European politicians in official capacity receive the religious leader of Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to sever Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not unleash into violence on the streets, demanded the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burned, Randaliers shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We need to make sure that we do not also build up social explosives and release them into violence.
We must take this seriously," he told the "New Press" in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, states and municipalities were already working hard to alleviate problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this is already showing first successes."
However, it is too early to warn.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs like in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had carried out heavy street battles with the police in recent nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
However, the President of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the German government.
In the face of the riot in France, Kolat warned of "impact effects".
The situation in Germany is not as brisk as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under the age of 25 is "above average".
Above all, more training places need to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a perspective."
However, the president of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France "social control takes place in the families".
Many young people with a migrant background also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned, "But we still have to be careful."
“Young people should be given the opportunity to participate quickly in work and training.”
In the meantime, it remained largely quiet at night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning garbage bins and cars.
Since the day before, around 1000 security forces have been working to ensure peace and quiet.
Police will crack down for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the riots attacked Toulouse.
The riots were inflamed in a traffic accident in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The chancellor’s far-reaching appearance documents that the coalition’s content is at an end – and that nothing is to be expected of it.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her desolate appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wild and content-poor, one must say: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be ruled by her.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is focusing too much on foreign policy with a somewhat arrogant sentence.
That was provincial, she said, first showing that she did not want to understand what the critics were about.
In the Bundestag she has clearly documented for everyone how true her accusation is.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a retired politician who flees to foreign policy and even stays in distress there.
Example of climate protection: It praises itself unbridled for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate targets in this country.
In any case, the self-praise - so much immodity the CDU chief would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the floskel that the upturn is coming to the people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than beautifully speaking to the world.
But in the realm of Angela Cloud, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of low-earners?
There are a few side sentences left for her.
It is indicative how often she promises herself when it comes to the child surcharge.
There are three steps that Merkel needs to take in order to put out a half-straight sentence.
It stumbles on strange terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the Republican presidential candidates' YouTube debate, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are making a hard beating - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already discharged on the first topic.
He has made New York a “refuge for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
“I would say his own house was a harbor for illegals,” Giuliani replied, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of employing private immigrants without papers.
Candidates blow to the attack: Because the Republican base continues to have no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-filmed 30-second videos that internet users have submitted via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
“With this kind of isolationism we have brought Hitler to power,” McCain blames his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is strongly read by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn waterboarding, a method of interrogation that simulates drowning, as torture.
The reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that the campaign’s key issues are now beyond the Iraq war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause flaunts in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, pleading with the base and television audiences that he was still one of the advocates of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, gets into trouble when he is asked about his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled in civil for the first time
A day after his resignation as head of the army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure, particularly from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now governs for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency Musharraf imposed on 3 November.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, soon after his oath, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency and fulfill another demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied with his weighted lawyers after imposing the state of emergency in early November, had rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of northern Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany’s supergroup of the Seventies re-musiced: the three band members of Harmonia played their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a recording of her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then they were much more famous abroad.
The planned sensation then takes place in the form of three seated gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and especially their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the middle in a flower-white shirt at the age of 63.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends at the console.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally joins a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What can be revealed here: Targeted inquiries revealed that although the name floated through collective pop memory, it was by no means so lasting to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock has always been more important in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne-based group Can for their life’s work, one saw in the hall questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later stuck on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the foreign is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and in that time also developed a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously musiced with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first, they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the perhaps most radical German group at the time.
By 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as urban communards.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
Rather in a spicicious artist existence.
It is alleged that there was also a blemish of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art.
Some of the things that Harmonia did.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For as quiet and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered material distress.
Rice gathering wasn’t just for self-finding.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record backdrop of almost 50 people, as someone thinks they can remember.
From Rother came then the desire to force harmony and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother ended up in the Esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of nurturing the Krautrock as its own German contribution to live music.
New! has already been excavated as Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
This would outline the full range of the influences of the Krautrock on the subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills in the void of the supergroup.
Brian Eno’s sentence floats with the most distinctive sounds in the room: “The only true music, you belong to the future.”
There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse.
For the creation of legends, projections of further black-and-white photographs of wired devices are used.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and drums to elicit unheard-of sounds from the instruments via self-made effect instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technically deepened tinkers.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, it is coughed under sound clouds and sung in a beautiful place with emphase "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (Can), technologies (power plants) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia cannot be taken out of rest now.
Even the most obvious thing is being thoroughly reconsidered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can take your nerves away or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murdering Peace", two films deal with the Balkan War.
Both are not convincing.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and gambler or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because too many nice and insignificant roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism expelled one the desire to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes the Hunted" (Why do movie titles have to be as long and confused today as driver tariff contracts?) perhaps.
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what could have become if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has his best times long behind him, but who himself has preserved considerable remnants of the former charm as a ruin-like monument to his decline.
But despite this trumpfe, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Morderischer Frieden", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serb from Kosovo snipers, whereupon the one immediately falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not represented here as the sole root of all evil, the flat-screen TV film loses itself all too quickly in geiger and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored quite exemplarily, why there has actually never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian high war criminal “the Fox” could have become a new “Apocalypse Now” with another director and another screenwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times small teams go to the forest to do something the military can’t do and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the decayed cynic with heart than he's introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also inspire him with a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party finally goes down the drain when, within the last five minutes, the reporters in the time-lapse process succeed in what NATO, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed to do in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that one wants to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinematics.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they should exceptionally agree here) not to carry out the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the good and the bad are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I see the swollen foreheads compassionately, implying: how exhausting it is to be evil."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the Balkan war film genre.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all of Iraq’s films were Hollywood’s big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie either.
Almost always: when a star roams around the world’s hotbeds or minefields, something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Beyond All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time.
It took decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with Schindler’s List.
Some of the films will probably still mature - the Vietnamese works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" now considered as classics have not been celebrated at all as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today, where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, we know too much about the world’s conflicts.
And that robs screenwriters of the carelessness it takes to tell good stories.
"Being or not" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcastically distant artist glance of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
“Great cities will always be horribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrific way, and war will always be in Yugoslavia.”
Beust reaps criticism for Olympic rejection
The mayor’s withdrawal from Hamburg’s bid for the Summer Olympics has come under heavy criticism from politics and business.
Many want to keep fighting for the water games.
But von Beust urges realism in assessing opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described a resignation as "not good for the economic location".
No other project has unfolded more motivating forces in the city in recent times than the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sporting political momentum could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it "which emanates from a changed ray of time".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with previous statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund expected for the beginning of December on an application by Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we have so far envisaged until 2028."
However, the dream is not defunct for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beusts' statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to lose an opportunity by burying the plans at this point," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
There, Beust called Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put Olympia on the map and excluded housing," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD always called for an integrated planning for the Olympics and a later use of housing for the Little Grasbrook, the CDU has unilaterally placed on the "event factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg failed at Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
Those who combine the terms Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently in Sweden, fabricated wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol’s work directory.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm-type" brillo boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's "Brillo-Boxes" of the year 1968, "Internal research at the Moderna Museum in Stockholm now comes to a sobering result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has made the Moderna Museum part of the art in 1995 as a gift, are well the replica of the art.
The prehistory is nested, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited, with Warhol's consent, hundreds of brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were not (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
They were not works of art, but their examples, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes, which at the time were authorised as original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Typ Stockholm" rightly entered the history of art and auctions.
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has examined three privately owned brillo boxes in addition to the six museum-owned, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press chipboards were first primed and sanded, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press chipboard with a paint roller without primer - it is also not oil, but acrylic paint.
“These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol’s brillo boxes,” says Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: “If the ‘Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board’ in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will release the six boxes in its collection as a copy.”
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would pursue the “serious accusations” made regarding the soap powder boxes.
But since then, they have been shrouded in relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered, who had fenced themselves in a hotel in Manila and called for the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, told reporters in the hotel.
Government loyalists had previously stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been locked in the building for hours.
About half of them were on trial on Thursday over a failed 2003 coup attempt - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly quit with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers, who were supposed to guard him, apparently had run over to him and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces locked the district around the noble hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The national security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Critics of the government had called for major demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of around 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after nearly 24 hours on the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, the company said on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There had previously been speculation about an acquisition.
One keeps the option open to increasing the share of Versatel even further.
The move aims to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, suspicions had already arisen about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The cash house only holds the shares for a third party, it said in the financial market.
United Internet already had a stake of nearly 10 percent in the mobile company Drillisch the previous day.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
5.15 million shares of which United bought Internet for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have initiated discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesman said.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP to take over competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to settle for a good 10 percent stake in Freenet and not use their right to acquire another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular also to further increase the stake in Freenet AG, it said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
Freenet poker, which has been going on for months and is hard to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile subscribers and 1.27 million DSL and full connection customers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another about four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
