Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria have brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 percent of the vote, the country's leading political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which lost nearly nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; notably for the People's Party, which triggered early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
The voters apparently punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the earliest reactions to the results, speculation was made about the possible resignation of the party leader and current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday, at the party leadership’s extraordinary council.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election, which remains the most likely outcome, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP grand coalition.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still united, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ's abolishmented the same part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is planning to return to Vienna, on the national political stage, apparently relying on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
Clearly, no other party crossed the four-percent limit and accessed parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India risk cooling
If the problem of Czech researchers accused in India of illegal cockroach harvesting could not be resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said it would result in a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister declared it today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, coming out of the talks, that the executive power could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under his jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could ask for bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide convicts with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them from India as well.
Above all, we want to keep the best relationships with India, which have a tradition that goes on for many years.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
“We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a great contempt,” he said.
The minister avoided the question of whether he had obtained from India a promise to deal with the matter.
“I’ve already received quite a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech referees the fight for the seafloor
It is approaching a wall electronic map, on which is represented Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
Now, he is not interested in the continent, but in a little point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area is however as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the UN Division for Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the division’s director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The ardour at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little-known world so far, rich in natural resources.
There are oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms unknown at the moment, which may hold the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A background larger than the hard ground
The coastal states have now begun to aspire vehemently to new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they are indeed using their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers off the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the convention, be entitled exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
For simplicity, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission for the Establishment of the Outer Borders of the Continental Shelf must be supported by extensive scientific-technical documentation, based on many costly surveys and metrology.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the Committee has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
At the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently seen a global impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which was allocated to it by the commission last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, which is the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in exploration.
The future benefits of the exploitation of the seabed will be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, make their request.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the zone of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, let's not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka, exaggerating that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the Convention, along with investors from a few other states, obtained the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right to be extracted in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is busy, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract it on an expanse with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a concretion.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the ground for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had sought help from Germany in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists from the Federal Army and GSG 9 officers, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technisches Hilfwerk, were at the place of release.
As the spokesman for the ministries said Monday evening, the German forces were finally not required, as the hostage-takers had released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of a forcible release.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted Germany's assistance in integrating it on the ground as a support force.
“Fortunately, it hasn’t happened so far,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers had kidnapped in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were transmahed into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as has the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have meanwhile arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five vacationers and special forces are expected to have taken off aboard an Airbus air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has shortly failed the $700 billion financial market bailout plan.
The Dow Jones was tumbling into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s financial market bailout plan.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was to curb financial market chaos did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the partisans had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on MPs to vote in favour despite the plan being unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concern that the state bailout plan could cap.
It came up shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into force, approval and approval from the House of Representatives and the Senate are required.
Organizers report increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, German travel thirst remains insatiable according to the study.
With regard to winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded revenues of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing booking figures are already dominating in the autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent more than in 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are figures from the GfK, which analyzes monthly booking data from 1,200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the US would be particularly in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
Besides that, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be destinations particularly sought after by the Germans.
Especially organized trips are in high demand, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be "more easily calculable for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusivie offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very much held back so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
Ballermann or Après-Ski hits continuously, beer in literal pitchers and celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV host and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers are throwing themselves at us and filling their memory card - very flattering, and that on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to reach its goal.
As a beer party tourist and normally living north of the equator of the Weißwurst, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on Thérèse Square, everything is half worse.
Almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks blasted or ashamed - this is completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume gets a few bizarre eyelashes at the banana-shock stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out to me that I would have tied my apron badly: "on the left means free, on the virgin middle, on the right married, on the rear widow."
Discreetly, I triple my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said and laughed.
Others don't give themselves as much trouble for these subtle flirtation techniques and wear simple felts, on which it is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their naked rear train without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is named Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first at the beer party.
He thinks it's "beautiful," with a lying "oooo" on it.
He tells me all this after being relieved of the cup he had drunk before.
Right next to that fire throat that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild peckers".
Others are not fortunate enough to be able to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o’clock in the evening, ribbons of rescuers run into the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses rather intervene in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered in tents into tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer festival: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the stuffed under the tarpaulin are not visible.
“These are the ones who can no longer swallow anything,” one of the rescuers shouts to me in response to my question and then disappears into the melee.
Victim of accident identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the accident Friday afternoon, in the city, on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were looking forward to entering its hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps away, from Asia, is one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, with observation towers at each of its angles, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a crossing to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, lagging behind the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, created by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to emphasize the widening of the diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a bed car towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish MP AKP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour journey, shaken on noisy tracks whose pace reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital—presented as a new city of a new centuries-old state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots represents an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built of stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and numerous pastries where middle managers in suit-tie-men and women-meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a center-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The purpose of this foreign policy is to now reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for both.
She had to do both.
"But at some point, 'I asked if 'Turkey shouldn't choose?'
"Turkey," he said, "does not want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone I have been able to speak with has recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway does not only go to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the station of Hydarpasha, after another sleepless night, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period when Turkey had been named "the sick of Europe".
At least, there is no longer any doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (deceased September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was meant to include those under 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20- refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to handle any type of music presented to him, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to "let music speak for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, although never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver should be named a knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts again, and I can honestly say that none of them ever disappointed me - and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, "only focus on certain people."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
William Woodruff's obituary (deceased September 25) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
This is what comes from the letter from the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but this is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Hop Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and life" because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second attack for Honda’s super sales
In November Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had good habitability, this new minivan has an even more spacious interior space.
Added to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a lineup very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among them are an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation was released on the market.
First of all, we can see that Honda renovated this model in a shorter timeframe than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz cars have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years represents is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase sales in Europe.
For example, when the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2007, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, representing a 17% growth in sales in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
Heads of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand’s managers hope to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars that is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% decrease in sales.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to gain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door, compact-sized hybrid – 4.37 meters in length – on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on markets and the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, following its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change at 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and the interior space as well.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a gasoline reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk – which has a double bottom system – can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to the exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz which opened at an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2- and 1.4-litre gasoline thrusters.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This propellant - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan took inspiration, this time, from nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center made this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan safety shield.
This robot will allow the brand’s vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the eyes composed of the bee, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed a so-called laser range finder.
It detects obstacles that are located over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
“As soon as it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and will immediately change direction by forking its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory of Movement and the project’s chief engineer.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
“Every second this device only needs to process information and act on that data.
It does not need to retain the intuitive information or logic of prior maneuvers, which is why it can run continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first car to develop new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced in standard cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot runs on lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the Treasury of the United States, besides having a lot of cash to make plans, is not devoid of geniuses.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say, the Hotel of bad credits... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master leads us to think several times if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And most importantly, where to do it.
It is certain that this game gives useful information but not detailed.
This is no longer a game reserved for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It’s better than nothing, since it’s unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry into its table of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, which will disburse $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a new welcomed by a sharp drop in its stock price.
A week after unveiling an interim deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The retained price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, 28 percent above its current price.
Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% at $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but puts it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been amended in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, told Tokyo, “we thought that the stake would be composed entirely of ordinary shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into common shares within a year if they trade more than 50% above the conversion price, or about $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley says MUFG’s capital will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a spokeswoman for the group declined to clarify the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to show a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "clearly" eased his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tempting for the group, which saw its stock price melt in half as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt soared.
This cost refluxed on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, was the third to put to the vote a draft new constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the vote.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, he had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted outside the polling stations and a countdown by a non-governmental organization announced a large "yes" victory, between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The “Constitution overwhelmingly triumphed,” he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the seat of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place in calm according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was about a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft constitution enshrined the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Supported by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who can hold up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and run for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
All 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were taken back safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at about 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, attached to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to the Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been dumped from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 Special Forces personnel, two helicopters on board, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire has occurred, and half of the kidnappers have been killed, the others fleeing," the official said.
He said 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of our Secret Service, Special Forces men," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle in which the kidnappers were on board, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed they were linked to a rebel group from Darfur, the Sudan-United Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupying the current election campaign.
That's all right.
But one area of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the amounts of misery given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and this in concert.
In Quebec, the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with excavating history, preserving with three mounds of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and policy makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are assisting the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European bank in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, in the amount of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also owning interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourgish and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this case, also appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Competition Officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis amplifying in more than a year is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be made in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (up to 49%) of the capital of the bank located in each of the countries.
The bank is undoubtedly going to sell part of its stakes, including primarily the principal insurance business acquired last year by the Dutch company ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis stocks began a dizzying fall, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company’s shares fell 12 percent to their lowest level of 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the present value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company's leaders, is not realistic.
The company's management accuses the uncertainty overseas, in connection with the adoption of the $700 billion U.S. bailout plan, of being behind the downfall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank’s customer circle and no agency was assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of information regarding the prescription of medicines, in any case, to the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like entrusting a fox to his chicken coop," Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and capital insured in the event of damage depend on the health condition of the client, and if they consider the risk to be too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after learning about the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily provides himself with pharmacies, data on the person's drug purchases in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, which disease the person suffers from and what his health condition is.
For example, if that person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, it refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately places them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a risk coefficient, so there is not much left for the insurer to do other than paperwork. However, tiny problems may still arise.
Disadvantages of this program include the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is seen by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while others do not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data. They must ask the patient for permission before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctioned for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing laboratory test results and linking them to drug use data to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to data, and controlling usage is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on expanding the circle of authority over data-providing companies is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not sufficient and therefore he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data on the sole consent of the data subject.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent or not, since if he or she refuses, the insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus, in the end, the hens depend on the kindness of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India have doubled their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global, issues.
Today there will also be a France-India summit where cooperation in the field of atomic energy will be discussed above all.
The European Union recognizes that India is an emerging major democratic power that should be given a broader right of speech in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They also did not go too far on this issue yesterday at this 9th summit held in Marseille.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they were going to double the trade, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods increased from $25 billion to $55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have legally harmonised the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civilian flights, and in this way, air trade can also grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with on the one hand India, which is the EU's leading trading partner, and on the other hand New Delhi, which is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on this subject was raised.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been called for, although both have a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains true to the energy and climate agenda, notably that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as on the need for a global market at the climate conference next year, and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is now visiting the French capital, where during a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the news agency, the deal would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers attended the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition, more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as an honorary guest.
It will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: indeed, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by an appointment with the press in the Room Struktur, butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books is gradually decreasing compared to the total of Italian production, and in particular, compared to that for adults and children.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one that Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared."
The sheriff said no human remains were found on or near the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) said that a few hours after the wreck was spotted, an investigative team sent to the site identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal belongings were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had travelled the world by plane and non-stop.
Among all these records, also the one to have flown at 15,445 meters in height, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you're not expecting.
An unusual 4x4 with an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the latest off road "compact" of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of newness in this sector.
Thanks to its unusual, unexpected and unconventional content, the communication will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
Thus the hype that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the heart of Milan’s shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, you will have the impression that when looking at the image, the auto comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of innovative Elimin8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to attract the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the group "Ultra Italy" that has followed the Italian national team for years, and that, until now, had never created big problems.
Never had he ever clashed with the tifosi opponents.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (little in reality) from Campania and Puglia have been added.
They had tricolor flags on which their hometown appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed to be unidentified.
They are inspired by the English tifoserie.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifoserie of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian tifosi, 144 notes for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed all controlled them: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal waits to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police, and then take action: in this case, it could be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids attending Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now it is time for fear-emulation: that is, others risk adding to the first hundred and fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's national team game in Lecce"
In Puglia is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Ease, i.e. the secret services, which deal precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duke-Duke choirs, and the outstretched arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really not pleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Observatory of the Viminal (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste, home to a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, praising Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist," adds the Observatory's No. 1, "the crimes must be attributed to the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in line, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s anthem: these too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polite.”
