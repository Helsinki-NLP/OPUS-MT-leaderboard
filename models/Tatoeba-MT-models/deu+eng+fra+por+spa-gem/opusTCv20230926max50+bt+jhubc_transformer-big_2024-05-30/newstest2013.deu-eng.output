A Republican Strategy to Oppose Obama’s Re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to fight election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, reaffirming that election fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
The Republican lawyers have reported only 300 cases of electoral fraud in ten years in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the U.S. democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for holding the elections in each state.
In this sense, the majority of U.S. governments have announced new laws since 2009 that make it more difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has gained prominence after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as voters on election day, and voters vote for the right to vote for which a court record is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state has required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a passport.
However, it is often necessary to pay more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID card.
This goes even further.
Students who are considered to be voters who increasingly vote for democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who vote more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 promoted laws in eight states that abolished voter registration on election day.
In addition, you restrict the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections helped to register about 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the share of new voters registered has decreased by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the time for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they made up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made up only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, which represented 76% of the voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the passage of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of the democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear objective the influence of the results in the countries that are decisive for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the U.S. democratic system.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows incorrect results, with false negative or even false positive results leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already undecided men for conducting early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have obtained the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the US, there were numerous disruptive factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in mortality among patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that after 12 years of follow-up, the probability of metastasis formation is 30-40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years and 40 years, respectively, if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent also have a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer is detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancers can remain untreated if they do not impair the quality of life in the long run, and in these cases he is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and offered treatment as the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be treated are determined.
I still recommend that the test be carried out.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not it should be performed.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle remedy to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and exercised adequately.
“If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several also remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously damages people’s health.
“There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,” said Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after cigarette smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, grim, mast, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against grimmed bowel cancer,” he adds.
Diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of developing a grimm or mast colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently inconclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies of vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another more likely showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preload.
"Executing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson sparked some attention last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or "least false" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but data is still lacking to be completely certain about it.
Still, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, as there seems to be little risk of deceiving yourself, and let’s look at what it’s all about.
There is an inevitably inevitable law in this world that causes two objects not to be present in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and don't try too hard as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that there is also such a law for it: the Pauli’s exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same “quantum state”, this “state” consisting largely of some of their properties.
Based on this, physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens who are called Fermione and kindly obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons move, an evil band of anarchists, to whom nothing is sacred - in any case not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which is absolutely amazing), these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "message" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "interfered" at exactly this location, approximately like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, needs to be "interfered" in order for this boson to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, somewhat comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be shrunk by a very large rock.
That’s why a giant particle accelerator like CERN is required – the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! – to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don’t – for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on its own to the fridge.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon by the way) do not have a mass.
What can all this research be "good for," Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to closely study any deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who yearningly hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It has to be said that the latter still has major deficiencies, since it does not offer an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (up again!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were none.
By the way, in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who in 1962 developed the first permanent dash laser (the first were pulsed) - has already said that the laser was considered more of a "laboratory playground" in the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life with its committee on "Dignity Dying".
The debate needs to be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
“However, it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigns to be helped with the meal.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is for my diarrhea to be cured because it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing while standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person," he notes, to accept a step backwards.
Because according to several people working in palliative care, big events take place in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care facility all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed with so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who care for them.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “consciously and by suffocation.”
But through the disease, I really got to know my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I don’t have any wishes in life anymore,” she says before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She is still expecting a last visit in the next few days from her son, who comes from Italy.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers offer personal care and help with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more enjoyable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
That's very little, considering that we're all going to die one day.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given an oral care with brandy or Pepsi as desired.
Diabetics no longer have to check their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died overnight.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We are helping family members and patients alike,” said Nathalie Savard, director of nursing.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, no day is like the other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows while being pushed to his honor, a 36-year-old man surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children tragically dies after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Home Palliative Care Society in the Greater Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care that causes several doctors specializing in palliative care to be concerned about passing a law regulating dying and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by prominent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to go on to death relief.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the ER for 14 days with great pain without taking any steps to relieve her.
I fear that patients want to die only because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst predictions, until the last day.
Hélène Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued a cumbersome chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was giving up the fight, she told me.
She told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not granting that wish after their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in the patient falling asleep either sporadically or permanently until his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to put me to sleep,” but “I want my pain to be alleviated.”
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road construction office, construction companies, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell each day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s strange how the system has been crumbling since taking drastic measures,” said Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
The scandal was uncovered by him due to an in-depth investigation into the misappropriation of the Quebec road works contracts, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he stresses, "the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts," because some of them restrained their instincts in order to keep their share!
The Charbonneau Commission “has already brought down two mayors,” he adds, hoping that it will be able to “show the tactics behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
Established in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit, with its troops, is also making great efforts at government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Troop", which since 2009 has caused the "channel cartel" of Montreal to take a more restrained approach in the artificial bloating of the treaties...
In recent weeks, she has conducted series of house searches and charged with fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving lubricating money in exchange for public contracts.
Incidentally, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were strongly charged.
The latter has caused a stir by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the preservation of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito had his hand everywhere in the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals in power at the time.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts whose costs were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprisant has described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted to being lubricated by artificially inflating bills with false extras by 30-40%.
In addition, a organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of intentionally overlooking a shadow budget that filled his cash registers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first deputies from Montreal to set an alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, from 2010 she opposed the sale of a community land that was purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% Black Money in Election Campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately being carried out, she says it “pulls on a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of the ant-infiltrated system to stop the evil and denounce the culprits.”
She said the procedure was “painful, but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but we would need a Montreal-only investigative unit and supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials stole several hundred million dollars", but he is above all concerned about the role of "mandators who are in the picture about tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting from a share of 70% black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak clap of reality."
The government of Quebec suggests limiting donations to parties to $100, which it says would not change the situation: "Unless campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for public procurement and party financing: “We can’t fall deeper; by bravely going to the bottom of things, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws.”
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh at it to take a look at their own backyard...
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season you have taken on a new level with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my level of play.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I'm not breaking out in enthusiasm.
From my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progressive progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new additions this summer are used to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that every training session is decisive.
This means that a player like me has to offer his forehead and wants to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
- Of course.
Ancelotti respects all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in the Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as the leader.
We are in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have to speak our word against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group before Porto so that we can play the rematch of the eighth final as a home game.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
To become a big European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for themselves in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the resources to make this project take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as it was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really important for us to reject this title.
Last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be a master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right year.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.
We totally accept this.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0 and you still find something you can blame us for, it’s certainly a bit frustrating.
I wonder what people are expecting.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to create a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
We have shown strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has been unable to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons and has also made huge expenses!
In terms of the amounts invested, you were believed to be a 15-point lead for the game break!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better, that we speak of a "Zlatan dependence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has accomplished is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from knocking out some game time.
I’ve seen things that I’ve grown stronger from.
Today I succeed in making good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "blues".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must demonstrate exemplary behaviour.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and leads to victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will take the “blues” to Brazil.
Does the forced draw in Spain on October 16 (1:1) represent a start game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange like BitTorrent, which allows for the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin peaked at $30 in June 2011, it fell to $2 five months later before recovering today to around $10 (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies like the “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through gaming (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, each time the trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously account holders, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data associated with this transaction is electronically signed by a dual encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public accounts account book distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege to add that additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clearer electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing gets "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the correct one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay for cheating twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without shortcuts, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but divisible except one hundred millionth, which leaves a certain margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol,” assured Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Major actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the invoice book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a “mega closing sale” was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company that converts bitcoins into gold, said in a statement.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are thus cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by merchants, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
All you have to do is provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that it has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are reconsidered in favour of more horizontally aligned systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to break through, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB's report, by the way, provides for a reassessment of the various risks that are now highly regarded in the event of a success of this currency.
We moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain ownership of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the wounded and disgraced.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there as the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed with French loans, was duly carried out.
Truck and tank convoys flown over by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban influx in Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by war because of the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
At that time, their takeover was seen as a kind of liberation and a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have transformed themselves into businessmen by seizing government land to sell it as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from massive American subcontracting.
They have been discredited, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who were able to take advantage of American grants: the capital flight is considerable.
The young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, representing a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose command it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already striving to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization on the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 constitution, the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long ago.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional jams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
Rumor has spread that Afghanistan has immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have nearly left the Mes Aynak copper mine, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) do their excavations at the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to re-establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French fighting forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girls and boys gymnasiums, Institute of French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to achieve the "hearts and spirits" and the impossible task of reconciliation of aid and offensive.
This work, for which many local workers were required, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often lying at an altitude of more than 2000 meters.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the revolt led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, it would be necessary to continue with less, well-controlled and directly affecting civil aid in their favor.
A Constitution with the Breaking Rod in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power, it has decided to put everything on one map.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state granted this plenary two additional months to complete its work.
For nearly two years, Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his “autocratic delirium” by continuing to “break his word” and “trap right.”
His supporters assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, forcing the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
It is also a way for the president to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
After affirmations in an interview with the American weekly magazine Time, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum by resorting to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of attorney", the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constituent assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals did not comply with the call.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they felt they were unable to showcase their views.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
In order to achieve the decision-making capacity, 11 deputy members were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly unanimously adopted.
The commentators found it entertaining, by the way, that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed at the time of prayer, as some members of the board felt that the pendulum clock of the constituent assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
“Psychology” is the reply of the liberals, who see it only as a propaganda strike.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the constitution takes place via other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing, since "the people who are asked to comment have not been elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are also nurtured by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less temperate than the current one.
“At the moment there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he admits that “there may be ambiguity in relation to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide on it.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticized for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue is the powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not presented to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Likewise, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights associations have called for.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text they consider to be liberty-threatening.
The act of blasphemy is being maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no longer refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons to visit Israel.
Prostrate before the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding ceremony, walking on the water, the calming of the sea storm and fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the shrines are found in Jerusalem.
Here believers go on the Path of Suffering or the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path starts at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion, an anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the most holy place of the Jews - the Crying Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notebooks with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Take a trip to the heights
The ruins of Masada fortress form the remains of the secret hideout from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins by their own power.
All the others take a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters is the famous ski resort Hermon, which attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can reach it by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, there were supposedly pagan gods living on the top of the mountain.
Visiting unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumra manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in rock caves in the Judean desert are preserved as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There, the collection of works by impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso will be exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers at the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the children’s memorial built to commemorate the 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Doing Something for Health
Israel’s three main recreation areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathes there all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise water has a high salt content, thus carrying even non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sole) and healing mud as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to calm damaged nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
These secrets hold the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea route connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
According to legend, Fortuna is held by anyone who touches the walls in the alleyway with her zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries on photo appointments.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city in Judea and residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Nowadays evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
A watchlist for tourists
When you travel to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money on the trip is preferable not in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be exchanged in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you can usually travel by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stops that connects the lower city to the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground cable car.
A ride within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is enough including transfers for a ride of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and foods that contain both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you can choose from a variety of dishes including beef and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-nourished cats that stroll cozy and undisturbed through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them asleep on the rooftops of parked cars.
Cats like busy places and don’t say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists entered the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the 2010 comparison period, before the visa requirement was lifted on February 9, 2011.
"The Big and Powerful" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MPs and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading with counterfeit certificates
Every year, 13 million workers travel to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families left in the home.
On December 1, a law came into force that requires every labor migrant to take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this scheme only applies to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, over time, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
You have to take not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
All the examination bodies will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship of Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the press several times before the law came into force: What does this bring?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills bring to both the Russians and the guest workers?
Above all, migration officials say, it is about reducing the number of forced labourers.
“Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers,” said Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency’s Tajikistan representation.
However, your rights must be protected before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical assessment face problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who under the pretext of aid put him in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of his peers for months without food and documents and create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home you will be promised the One, and on arrival you will be cheated, get your passports taken off, and do not receive the promised salary," confirms the head of the Labour Migration Administration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't blaspheme, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to make their money in Russia, admit that not only do they not master the language of the target country, but they can hardly express themselves in their own language in writing.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmens, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a reasonable elementary education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
Only immigrants with legal status must take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers continue to be illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Not allowed for unauthorized access"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The Russian police officers know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and this results in cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
“Don’t pay for fake papers.”
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be counterfeit.
Some counterfeit certificates that certify the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners received it not for nothing: every migrant who hoped to avoid the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That’s more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant three thousand rubles.
Both officials and civil rights activists agree that the main immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be bought easily.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise that they will get time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered positions in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
The Ministry of the Interior ignores the illegal arms market
Extremely low share of legal weapons in crime
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the Weapons Act for private gun owners.
The authorities responded to recent events: wounded in wedding shootings and seven dead in the assassination of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradov.
Police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
Irina Jarowaja, chair of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, supported the proposal and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be presented to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter was published on the internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - demanded that the authorities distance themselves from "senseless intensifications".
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal prosecutor, Wasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes with the use of registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not stop criminals from using the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, any weapon can be found in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the distribution of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons enter the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website accepting weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranez said.
On the second channel are illegal weapons that are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons that have been stolen from both the police’s armory and directly from law enforcement officials.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons warehouses.
In many military camps there were often explosions.
“There is evidence that some cases were firefighting to cover up the lack of weapons,” the former military official said.
According to Baranez, arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
“Today, there are countless private armaments factories that cannot withstand international competition and therefore waste their weapons at hand on the black market, for example in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is an own, sometimes artisanal production and a mafia that organizes the smuggling," he said.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated how much each of the five channels roughly contributed to the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
According to investigators, the vast majority of illegal weapons come from the army and the prosecution authorities.
Half of all guns on the black market have come through the “debt of those responsible who have been dealing with guns in their work,” the report said.
According to data from the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% are due to gun theft, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at an arms store, who does not want to be named by name, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been bought by no one because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get supplies in an arms warehouse.
A weapon, for example a TT type gun, is purchased via a flag.
The weapon is issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
“Of course, the police know everything and therefore, if they are unable to comply with the crime detection plan, periodically carry out control purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons,” the sales adviser added.
"Like in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers often find acquaintances with each other.
I had watched websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would be waiting for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price of the gun was only there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and date with a code such as "by Ivan Ivanovich, who has aligned that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I’m even talking about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the beating rings just because he knows I'm not whistling him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was pictured.
“I felt like I was in the luxury store,” recalls the military man.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, but I drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the gun has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
There is no need for any papers or personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate amount of money," the advertisement on the website says "buy combat pistol or rifle".
There users place their orders and make requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without license," user asks "Ivan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go online to the service.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to hoard coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the weapon's hiding place," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranez stresses that in the end you can also leave empty and come behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go online to the service.
“People come like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in Siberia’s labour camp and are allowed to hoard coal,” he says.
One Makarov for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices are expected to range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a pistol of the Makarov type for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is dispensed in military weapons warehouses by mid-range overseers.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences throughout Russia fell by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of cases of theft and blackmail revealed related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the US
One in four U.S. teenagers will be sitting behind Mc Donald's checkout at some point.
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the United States against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will swell further or whether they will soon run out of air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the humble wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
Until now, this sector of the economy is hardly organised by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, sometimes leading to hand-mixing.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, dropped their work and pushed together with trade unions and leftist activists to the chain’s branches, whose target group is low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The merchandise in the Walmart stores is on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy from their own workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply only because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand-held scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday protests called for wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company’s health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, prove that if the company raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than they donate for wages now.
If Walmart completely converted the wage increases to customers, every purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, that would be overspending of just $12.39 per year compared to today.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that only nine states protested and did not inflict any losses on the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post's website that in total "less than five" Walmart employees were laying down the work and the protest action was just "another PR trick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, but their target were not Walmart stores (which are not desirable in this progressive city and therefore so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other low-priced restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you don't get paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 an hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too high, and on average their simple New York employees get $8.90 an hour.
Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get along in New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all U.S. teens were behind the counter after school at McDonald’s, but the teens were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I’m constantly encountered with people who complain that they have to get along with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began Thursday at 6.30 a.m. outside McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs at fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
U.S. law prohibits corporate management from standing in the way of this goal and from cautioning or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day ahead of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the protests was a gathering at noon in front of McDonald’s in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, “McDonald’s says it sells billions of portions, and yet you’re not given sick days, and you’re not paid for your honest work!”
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that “we should jointly support fast food workers so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!”
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were there, not all of whom are employed in the fast food industry where tens of thousands work in New York.
It remains to be seen whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be moderately deceived"
The theme of advanced reality, popular with modern technology fans, is usually perceived by the lens of special glasses lately.
Google first presented a working model in the summer at its annual conference, then in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company’s scientists.
It stimulates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is conducting.
- We are dealing with the interaction of humans and machines, but we want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, most of humanity has been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens that are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look forward to 5-10 years and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays, no Xbox is being sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else can we expect in the future?
Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, a lot is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system gets more data) has been improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change that by working on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It’s popular, but isn’t it overrated?
- It is certainly not the universal solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all those around about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any type of interaction with computers is good, but each in its specific niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and short rather than outgoing gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, however, the future belongs to mixed types of control, for example gesture and language.
- What do you mean?
- We'd ask you, for example, to give you this bubble can?
They say it and point to it at the same time.
- Usually I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and can't afford at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the next few years we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to capture people’s reactions more accurately.
These can be laser sensors, for example, since they offer a good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands based on working with Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
It is necessary to take into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and the number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps are insufficient, especially for gestures.
In our lab in Redmond, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with a adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
For my work, I needed a device like this, just without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or increase the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how that helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- Unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of applying advanced reality technology in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand on the road, but I think this: the most great variant would be a "changing" extended reality, in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and this is their strength (only you can see private ones), but at the same time also their weakness, because an extended reality using glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often talk about that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough might well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection support.
She perceives pressure excellently!
However, there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "pictures in the air" something hand-held, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located, creates a feeling that is currently as weak as if someone was blowing over the handballs.
There are also ligaments for the wrist that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, too, which is a potential direction.
- Did you try to deceive the brain?
It makes you think it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed space think he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms and large balls.
Until now, the brain can only be moderately deceived, and we still have many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive to a researcher: We are only at the beginning of many topics.
Your own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburg Avant-garde" project, which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the exquisite list already landed high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city's borders and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bearded man, who you meet at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever Kirill Miller’s paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city, and by his presence on the street, he charms his fellow citizens with a smile on their faces and ensures a good mood for them.
Recently, he grabbed a turning organ and became a Petersburg turning organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistic existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the gray norm causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Cultural Palace, where my work was exhibited.
I understood that I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free painters, but not officially recognized at the time, came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonevschina"; from this "Pushkinskaya 10" was born, and then it was over.
It attracts me to theater, to fashion, to music, to everything but literature.
It was important to me to be at the center of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemia, the house of the Petersburg Bohemia, until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how cord came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for the playback, wore tight jerseys and included the now-fashioned composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the art clinic.
Our employees and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, there was a survey in the press, which was about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and so I reached the culmination.
It is not easy to work in new times by old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my paintings are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and makes you afraid to be that way.
In a clown, all this blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let’s save the world, for example, by prescribing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is oriented towards the exterior and not the interior of the man.
But maybe you shouldn't give a man a hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears through the disguise.
Recently, we saw you in the role of an urban organ player, a cultural city like this should have a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the common people loved the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- But Stas Mikhailov's performances are several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons there are 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes to waste.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat on them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such paintings, which hang in a series with the works of Falk and Larionov at a collector.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, which is quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
They say: Servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real tsars were different, because the tsars may not have understood much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some experts who might be experts, but they will be blocked because they need higher-ranking experts who will correctly assess the former and clear the way for them.
All that counts now is your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art can be hard to grow.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that is much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the City of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Earth warming or collision with killerasteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth-dwellers on board go on a search for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises how we can reproduce in weightlessness or on the substitute planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
“Mars and Venus,” says the researcher at the Astronomical Sternberg Institute, Vladimir Surdin.
However, while conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first addressed by the researchers with regard to flora.
Already half a century before, experiments were conducted with plants.
The fourth generation of peas grown in orbit did not differ in the least of the earthly species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
A normal chick develops.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a hold; it has to be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without a solid surface, the chicks overflowed wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely blurred.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we hatched chicks and then put the whole thing in place because it's simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev about the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats were given offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans can do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was at Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts where everything went well after long flights and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying in orbit," concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory at the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
Water represents weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water is pleasant, it is a strange environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders are witnessing that life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother's womb for about 9 months in the amniotic water, and that he can then more easily get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swimming only 2 weeks pass.
"This is not enough time to forget something," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
So, while for a newborn child, weightlessness is a much more natural condition, the woman does not get away with gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles regress enormously quickly and thus also decreases the ability to squeeze the child out.
All right, let's bypass this with birth-inducing tools.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the formation of the earth, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in an exercise suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of elementary importance to his life.
"This experiment we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled person, a completely unsuitable person," predicts the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
Until now, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it will become a reality when the Earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships depart to a distant planet that will become the home for their descendants born in space.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> chief: Control of the black system fails due to political fault
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in relation to public contracts, but falls short of their application.
In a conversation for Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvy<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>í kontrollí ú<0xC5><0x99>ad, NK<0xC3><0x9A>), Miloslav Kala, said this.
“A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied properly – and I think this is not the case with us,” Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint inspection by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as towards the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls – so is the system now prohibited or allowed?
“A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the president of the government, and the control office, whose duty is now to monitor compliance with the law, hinders its activity,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of the two countries regarding public contracts were compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel examination with which we began about two years ago.
Simply put, it is about the European legislature defining how public contracts are to be handled. This is what national legislation is based on. Finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we were able to find extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws in our country may even be a bit more "strengthened and perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules over and over again, and that the actual application of the law has to be dealt with.
How can the project help you? What does this project mean for you?
It is precisely such a common control that could help us to stop constantly striving for the perfection of laws and the reduction and austarization of thresholds, if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering the thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even so that in this way we are only burdening the system with excessive "paperwork", and those looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or does the system work differently?
As for the authorities, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9A> is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similarly constructed as with us and also has a college that is only slightly differently formed.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, although Germany is a federal state, i.e. that these auditors also exist in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the state accounts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a model in some respects, although it certainly cannot be said that Germany is better in everything.
Is it because the auditors are better?
I certainly don’t, but as I said, I don’t like such comparisons.
In this regard, it should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any cooperation with our agency, would they?
Regarding the Czech legislation, how important was the amendment of the procurement law for your authority, do you already feel any impact?
Given that this amendment has only been in force for a short time, it has not yet had any effect on our examinations.
As our checks take place afterwards, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we are more likely to experience impacts in the preparatory phase of future controls - for example, we have introduced the new control instrument "Detection of risks of inefficiencies" and used it to review and analyze almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will of course have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among others.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positively, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be adhered to.
In accordance with the previous rules, persons subjected to an examination are already accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) in that any non-compliance with the Procurement Act amounts to a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to tighten the law even more?
In my opinion not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have made a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system merely puts even greater pressure on the bureaucracy.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let’s say which path is not good.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not obstruct entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the president of the government, and the control office, whose duty it is now to control compliance with the law, hinders its activity.
He can say, "We're changing the law and allowing the thing," but he can't say we're pretending to be nothing.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the tenderer with the best offer is excluded solely due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I think is missing from us.
On the roads there is occasional ice smoothness, but they are mostly dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there is some snow and ice smoothness.
However, mostly the roads are well accessible, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the roads were easily accessible this morning, and there was snow and ice.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should get a little warmer.
It is no longer snowing in the region, and in the lower altitudes there is only a thin blanket of snow.
However, there is about 30 cm of snow on the combs of the Ore Mountains.
According to the District Road Guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the first-class roadways in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes icy and smooth.
All roads of the second and third classes of roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, there remain sectionally icy or extended snow remnants.
Especially in the higher layers, therefore, increased attention is required.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of ice-smoothness, in higher positions and in the mountains there is sometimes an extended layer of snow on the roads, the road and highway management informs on their websites.
The road masteries warn drivers of ice smoothness, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
Smooth ice can be found in particular on roads of the second and third class in the districts of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially found on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické Hory Mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies at altitudes on the roads of the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely rainless.
The temperatures range from -3 to +1 °C, with a gentle wind blowing.
Pilsen (district)
The roads in the district of Pilsen are now well accessible, but local attention is needed and the driving style must be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it snowed before and the temperatures dropped afterwards, there can be ice smoothness on the roads.
Local fog is also to be expected, but the view will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the district street masters.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but increased attention is recommended by the road masters between the 80th and 131st kilometers.
The roads of the first class are mostly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, there can be ice smoothness in sections.
The roads of the second and third road classes are moist, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections also applies here.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Today, drivers driving towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district have to count on snowmatch.
After the use of scattered vehicles snowmatch remains on the pass <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>.
Nighttime snowing forced the road masters to use, in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of new snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually fully accessible.
"In the circle of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk there are still snow remains in the altitudes.
On the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass, drivers have to expect snowmatch in the direction of Jeseník," an employee of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk road administration told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK agency today.
Her colleagues in the district of Jeseník also had to go out at night, according to their data, the roads up to the altitudes are free and wet after chemical treatment.
In the district of Olomouc, the roads are fully accessible, but in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk, the drivers must drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still moist.
<0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem district, Liberec district
In Northern Bohemia, road masters report several poorly accessible road sections.
In addition to several points with snow or ice smoothness, the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice in the district of <0xC3><0x9A>stí n.K. is blocked according to the traffic police.
Temperatures also remain below zero, so that snow and ice will stay on the roads. However, from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, there are no problems reported, and the roads there are usually dry.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Smooth ice is reported in particular from the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless skies and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from the I/13 road on the border of the <0xC3><0x9A>stí n.L. and Liberec districts.
The road between Telnice and Kninice was blocked due to branches pushed from the snow load to the road.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: At our concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is one of those reports of disasters that we people so gladly respond to.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more likely to make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide charity event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is predicted for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, i.e. on December 20th, three concerts will take place simultaneously from 9 p.m. in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think with the public about the state in which we hand this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key tags against the end of the world, with the purchase of which people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded, along with other performers, the so-called anthem against the end of the world with the title "The End of the World falls out".
Even today, the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also be heard at the charity concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem is to be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems are broadcast live on Czech television in a direct broadcast.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X also sings with...
How did you work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we carry out many charitable events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, where we have been working for six years with the association Tap in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly cared for by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a building of its own will be built, which we will then move into with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers appear.
What criteria did you choose?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Suchý appear.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and for this concert we are also preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the USA then - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not very small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. In addition, we must of course carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we just witnessed in Russia that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
In Prague, Moscow is absolutely not handicapped, where it is still unusual for someone to travel in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even self-evident there that a wheelchair user is allowed in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still a lot of things we hang out after...
However, it should also be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in the public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly common for a larger group of disabled people to be actively involved in the social events, in this we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willing personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular right now, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a mentor at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensely.
And since I am a musician myself and I play saxophone, I founded a music group together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, that, as our moderator, Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, used to say, gets a little out of control (laughs).
But the band has only been known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It’s true that working with well-known singers has helped us, and we’ve also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and you cannot see it outwardly, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that you can approach things differently.
In the show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is considered with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression that the spectator most often has is of course compassion; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we would have to regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it is not only progress for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise on many things and also demand a certain discipline.
In my opinion, however, this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic performances, and when they find that they have rehearsals twice a week, preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm of many quickly fades away.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group. People come and go. You can't stop that.
Those who have the will and the desire to participate are always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 9 pm
Venues include: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will finally be connected via live circuitry and a joint interpretation of the anthem "World Endings Fall Out" by the band The Tap Tap sounds.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the installation of a multifunctional educational centre for the disabled, which will be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague. Cost: CZK 25 million
Entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency at a meeting of the Ministerial Council of the member states of the European Space Agency ESA, making it the second member of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts engaged in space travel, not always encountering understanding.
I recall, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld’s talk of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work “Entrance to Cosmonautics”.
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Prix REP deer funded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky’s world-renowned contribution to the development of space has been honored, among other things, by having one of the craters on the earth-facing side of the moon named after him.
Already in 1925 a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for launching or braking the Draisine.
The information in this regard comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with missile-powered missiles.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the surviving documents that the research had advanced to the stage of practical tests.
The research was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, a photoelectric rocket design by Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared in the trade press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the missile propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was terminated by the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space were published in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society is made in the November issue of the journal Problemy in 1954, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the creation of a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was expected that space exploration would have a future.
In its inception in 1956, the Polish Space Company PTA endeavoured to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact, the PTA became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 began flight tests in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>dów Desert with the two-stage missile RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for observing altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage missile, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
From this rocket three types were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with a capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude of all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
After that, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Also worth mentioning is Poland’s accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after Czech Vladimír Remek.
Repealing the Non-Profit Work Act is not a solution.
Last week, the constitutional court lifted the law on non-profit work.
This decision sparked a lively public discussion.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unrestrained financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), there are price tensions.
This term is to be understood as a condition in which the manufacturer tries to maintain economic competitiveness by importing favourable goods by "undercutting" the competition in order to seize a greater market share and thereby increase his profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheaply there, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with similarly high labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is further exacerbated by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused by them as a whole.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments supply their own populations to private capital regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictate of private capital, especially in the wage sector.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever-increasing differences between rich and poor.
For some years now, there have been public food outlets in Germany for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regularly cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU southern states will undoubtedly result in the same state in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century), or to starve for a wage on the margins of society, hoping that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
The question is, of course, where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, poverty only migrates from one country to another; or the capital remains completely out, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or even in Africa, the workers work for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim, to the point of overwhelming pressure, that the state is not allowed to participate in its own economy with capital, and that plan economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital firmly insists on its position that the state must not intervene steeringly in the economy.
But then one has to ask whether private capital does not influence politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense or even direct it.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent lobby that is ubiquitous in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual preference, legislation in which practically everything is punishable but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Ministry, due to a lack of finance, commissions private, closely intertwined legal companies with the drafting of legislation.
These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer proceeds from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Apparently, the liberal democracies are now quickly in a situation as Appian describes it in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius: "The state has long been in disintegration, and the offices have been filled with violence.
Against lubrication, by unlawful exploitation of advantages, or with stone and sword.
"People with character did not apply for office, so that, as a result of this decline, the state did not have a strong consul for eight months" ... "They began to really talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a solitary rule, and that a strong man the C<0xC3><0xB4>me was to be elected to...
As it turns out, today’s society, as in antiquity, is based on the reckless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is already by its very nature unable to recognize and enforce the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who are not striving at the slightest for deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the reckless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From the present state, the collapse of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break, at which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today’s elites are in complete ignorance of the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, of the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing today, and of the crimes against humanity as we know it from older and more recent history.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not a lasting one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state’s participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"... that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "... so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons did not want wars, there would be none,” says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a myriad of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others in turn support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide perpetrated on the Palestinian Arabs, and describe the State of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is guilty in these recurring waves of killing and who is the victim; in the end, the present-day inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the onset of violence itself.
I want to open the eyes of the readers behind the scenes, looking at who the 95 years of tension (as of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small village of the country in the Middle East are most useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and arise from my own understanding of who or which group of people influences the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost a history of the struggle for power.
In any epoch we can make up an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or if behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power did not arise within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be called the head of the octopus (I don’t know if anyone else stands above them, but I don’t exclude this) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 90s of the nineteenth century in order to prevent the association of their name with highly criminal acts, on the background of which the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth or both always stood.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are waging wars or preparing for them (before the assault on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the assault on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, with Russia in the meantime having put its central bank under the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild’s Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (i.e., state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was murdered in 1963; MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
The Rothschilds' global desire for power led to the formulation of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd century and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist state systems of Europe, by the second war in particular the colonial rule of Great Britain was to be broken, and the third war is to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would ultimately provide for their comforts and their luxury and would not consume as many resources), a universal religion would not lead to the pre-ecumenism.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order from chao – order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to aggravation of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed so that crises such as the ones they triggered in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they succeeded in triggering World War I by the murder of the Habsburg successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian tsar empire by the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power Austria-Hungary.
In order to be able to ignite the Second World War more easily, the bankers, through politics, created a latent situation of conflict by filling Germany with gigantic war reparations; thereby they created the prerequisite of impoverished masses, so that they had only to cheer the Germans with a sufficiently strong leader, who named the culprits and offered the simple solutions; another factor was the reduction of the Tchos.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, if possible on the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was torn from the chain on which the international bankers had originally held him, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become victims in the front line, this time along with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of contention and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply people divide into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with at the beginning the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, because the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, choose exclusively their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel, the falcon Netanyahu, is a typical example of a world economy that is prone to fascism, a politician loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything to spark a war with Iran, which, given Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly come to a global conflict that could only widen the world, and in the face of a global conflict,
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: “The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes every one of them to give a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, that no one can buy or sell except he has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom; whoever has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had maintained the patronage over his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the shah overboard, as it would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to liberate the gills only made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The destiny of the hostages sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy officials managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover up their true identity – they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film club that allegedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by “exfiltration” expert Tony Mendez also required Hollywood’s collaboration.
To make the camouflage credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialist journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels in the film alternate - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no great differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly overstated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck made a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
A smiled actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime film Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City Without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film, which is not set in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that set this director’s previous films apart from the Hollywood standard.
Affleck, however, also demonstrates this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the entrance sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, while still conveying the sense of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team achieve a similar effect even in fictional scenes (the wrong film rod on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many scenes that are exciting in the cinematic sense.
But he works quite successfully with the few, sometimes helping the reality - which then does not always look so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted from a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
Argo’s weakness is his too wide spread, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses a bit of traction, a film that one can follow with a certain interest, while savouring the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70’s.
But it is hard to awaken enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive to this day, and as proof of how exaggerated the ideas of the almighty and all-knowing intelligence services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls out an annual survey on the most absurd banking fees, has decided this year to host the competition "Absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
“This is what the EU’s recent plan to introduce a 40% share of women in the management of large European companies brought us to this idea,” Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising the survey, told the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the standardization of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk for insurance companies.
“Further incredible insights from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include, inter alia, the mandatory mixing of bioethanol into fuels, which as a result is detrimental to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the chicken cage size directive, which has made eggs considerably more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also reaped the factual prohibition of the use of the term "butter spread" or also the prohibition of the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from this or that trade and industrial lobby whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member countries (such as the Czech Republic currently attempts to enforce the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat, for example).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have any "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it only harmonizes the inconsistent national standards that would impede trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries, stating that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which according to balloons must be indicated when selling that children under the age of eight are not allowed to inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU cited an American study, which balloons say is the leading cause of child suffocation deaths.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market turtles.
There are some curious ideas at home too.
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who assumes an official function in the EU cannot use the term Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists, nominated Laissez Faire, in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, also the EU regulation on the extent of food stocks in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that were allowed to be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for mushroom preserves, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving grants for applications for grants.
These ideas, of course, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We're disadvantaged by the fact that we don't have a sea.
We will request a refund from the EU,” said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest had been very high and that the state warehouses were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission met the Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-EU), which in particular should be funds for the application of grants to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, the efforts of the EU to regulate and thus also to improve the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserve more recognition, according to some experts.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with deepening European integration, but which were forced in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also provoke the fact that, similar to other member countries in Brussels, the Czech Republic has to fight for the right to use specific denominations of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the national rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition goes back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzemák".
The term rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU now appear in the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübecker Marzipan or Parma ham, Karlsbader Zwieback, carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or Saazer hops.
With an EU mark, the Pardubician gingerbread or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>icer rolls can boast.
“People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur,” Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
I'm not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I wouldn’t run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the Republic be plundered for 20 years, as thieves roam freely while people are being raised taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something I don’t like, I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I'm over 40, and independent and partisan, I have no other way of influencing things than to run for office as a senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then immediately made your way to the castle.
Don’t you turn your voters away?
I have been telling myself all the time that I will start the fight for the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I will run for the office of President if I am elected Senator.
My goal is not the function, but the function is an instrument that I can use to realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people, scold in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we kill anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media who want to deprive you of your honor and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom of lying.
For example, I was allegedly bribed journalists or was a consultant to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
The battle for the castle has started with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations over 20 million crowns.
You have to change laws to do this.
As president, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring forward legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I advocated that the guidebook should remain a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or left with a good proposal, it is intentionally rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without drawer thinking and party dogs, I can take from any party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics more on the right or the left?
From a Czech perspective, it seems to me that people see me more on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely irrelevant.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It’s not about whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You dislike it when someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that with what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach it.
This can be called populism because of me, but all the proposals I have talked about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you only have keywords left.
In the long run, they do not get far in politics.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed in enforcing material and criminal liability, for example?
I have no other option.
To persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side in order to enforce these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally enshrine material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And then, if necessary, they will have to say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality pointing to misconduct can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just begun with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I can’t achieve anything on my own, so I’ve talked to several well-known personalities about whether they want to run for the Senate as well.
I spoke with Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, for example, but he refused because he was overworked.
In addition, I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the scam in the light fuel oil trade.
I started my candidacy with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I’m not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of voters did not go to the elections at all, and those who went have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayors and district chiefs.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the past of each potential party member, and I don’t have the money for it at all.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, what would yours look like?
I estimate my private assets at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb worth about one million, and then I have a few more million in the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream - James Bond has always liked how he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and don’t have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I be indebted?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to run the campaign on my own.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the salary of senators alone; so, for example, I could not finance my son the English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to keep your income?
Didn't you say you're going to push back on these activities?
But this is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I have partially cut back on my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that’s still the case.
But as president, I would stop doing my business entirely.
The full discussion can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the mind - on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently erected Bücherberg - 2 photos
“I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by at the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby large business, says: "But, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
They all have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes voluntarily to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town barely in need of visitation on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is a strange recordholder.
The 80,000-dwelling community has the lowest education rate in the entire Netherlands.
To counter this stupid circumstance, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to reconstruct the seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as beautifully brushed concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master the statistics: a library must come!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of bold beam diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with the usual serenity and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was still looking around and shrugging with its arms, the naughty Maas stacked his exquisite pieces of magnitude into a pyramid and ended his action-based speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So this is my proposal for the Book Mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain has been spilled.
It is part of a revitalization project, which includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and semi-detached houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Buchenberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small town retort, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a staggeringly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural structure in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Bookeldorado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the true pleasures of space and reading are unlocked by the walking climb of the topography.
The all-glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lights speak unmistakably the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
One is already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally the bookshelves are along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have turned the classic room configuration upside down and squeezed the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Bucherberg is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and house technology center.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes breasting, sometimes stair railings.
Look, feel and smell are strange.
Even embossed architects and civil engineers shake their heads over the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so one day we found a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root base in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the locked garbage.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) discolors into a dark, homogeneous, durable material that smells like new cars and sports shoes.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long hike you will be rewarded in the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and stuffed ficus trees.
They provide for the atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heat and cool with geothermal heat.
Although the Bucherberg is under a glass fall, even on sunny days the sun shines only briefly inside.
The wide wooden glue binders, which are transverse to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, serve as shading and capture much of the sunlight.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic shutters.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT industry, already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to the Boekenberg as Spijkenisses "latest overdue soul".
The reason: to open a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has emerged.
The shelves are filled to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for adornment.
With this, MVRDV has succeeded in achieving that royal discipline, which is called in the technical jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literature history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is balancing it on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the request for observer status of Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why did you?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany has to be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not believe it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is turning its foreign policy around, away from a policy that was managed by the US, so to speak, towards a German foreign policy.
What is more, the Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they’re still tapping into their role, but they’re on their way to a more “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy like France or Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy mean in concrete terms from the German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions independent of those of the US or European partners in national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
That is why it is necessary to be careful not to beat the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to put too much weight on it either, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from voting on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the United States.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be taken into consideration.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there disagreements between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think the administration under Obama secretly has a fair amount of understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, of course, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I think the actual disagreements are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can’t be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, even because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they need to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player - does Germany even want to take on a leading role?
Or is Germany still struggling to lead?
Germany is not used to it yet, which is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a larger role, various anti-German feelings are free.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this sense, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be receptive to a variety of neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is constantly decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's uncomfortable and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a name officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the actual names do not complain.
And even then it is not clear if they are right.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s law firm, who specializes in infringement of property rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters to register their brands.
So Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny entered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, for example the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that was also used by Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he opposes the fact that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word refers to "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty.
"This is harmful to business, you have to fight it," Pattloch said.
"The brand is diluted, the stand alone disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and procedural costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially with expensive flagship products.
According to market research company CLSA, China is the third largest luxury goods market and the fastest growing, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go to money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected lawsuits because after the long duration of the contested name had become the "market treaty".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist money because he violated his mark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any fault.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and space.
Last year, however, we had returned from the "emergency situation in the workflow to normal".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still awaiting completion in the Office.
Addressing this costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency said.
This also applies to the inventory of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were collected.
Simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To counteract this costs many times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
The company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was lifted.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
They themselves failed to do so because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO also rejected the objection of the Munichers.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent continues to fight today.
You have to be hellishly careful
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident in bringing the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complicated and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be calculated, the company’s archive had to look through even a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"That's how much we're worth," Wentzler says.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to go back to Europe.
That’s when imitators secure unprotected brands.
A Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business area, but it was still able to avoid registration.
“You have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, foreigners should "register anything that is somehow worth protecting, even in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registering.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to the last act of his brand drama, you would probably have to pay the other party royalties for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are being pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The history of a connection that surpasses far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look for the clock on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - push, deceive and follow each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it off his fabric shoes when he combines them with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers, between the ages of 23 and 69, have come from the human geneticist to the housekeeper.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and this one in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are about 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, according to UNAIDS, the United Nations’ AIDS programme.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take on a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child a school fee, a school uniform and a warm meal every day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller in Zulu or praise.
The Bantu language can speak fluently in this room no one but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has practiced songs in this foreign soft language and brings them back and forth to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers of air line from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are succumbing to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, what all of Swaziland suffers from can be seen in the smallest detail: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying at the middle of thirty is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a high school degree, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since taken care of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies are among the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), trippers and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - nevertheless: around 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human papillomaviruses are also common among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 diseases in 2001 to 3,698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than last year.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, lower abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Because in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STIs can be cured and late consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the gages that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"Overall, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairwoman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and powerful woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, with one of the grandmothers for example.
The Gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school lessons every day.
If you don’t have anyone left, you can go to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid for by the club as well as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is all over the country, one prefers to silence it dead.
A King with 14 Wives
“Aids is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Actually strange in a country where the King officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
There would be free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels through South Africa every two or three years together, singing songs full of grief, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many at the southern tip of the black continent still know from apartheid times.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already wiped out some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The trip also always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godsons.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulveni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light," the people there say.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers of airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can also see it glow there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids that have been hit by Mercury.
No one would link the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said Sean Solomon, chief scientist of the messenger probe.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth’s citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.

This snippet of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer Telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are to be recognized as blue dots, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborn" in the Star Circle Hall.
This star-forming region — called unromanticly W5 by scientists — has been discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has been captured by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-divided, three-divided), as dark stripes of dust divide the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the foreshadowers of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies race toward each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Whoever does not have technical abbreviations, may call them Southern Fire Wheel by their nickname.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows an excerpt from the iris nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The fog, 1400 light-years away, consists of dust particles that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, captured the Hubble space telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star fog is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The Star Cradle is always producing new youngsters.
This star cloud, coupled with the rosette nebula, also continuously produces new baby stars - 5,000 light years away from Earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it wasn’t created until shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 – even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever larger – and the insights they provide have grown ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows for glances into space over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable construction: the telescope is fixed at its angle of height - and therefore limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude angle.
Its peculiarity: the high collecting power of light.
In fact, despite a comparatively small mirror diameter, this is up to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to the space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
A view of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honors its name.
With its total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is supposed to be 42 meters long - and is composed of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
However, images are expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which, next to them, still looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea is a new, huge telescope - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the Hubble Space Telescope provides the most important impressions from space.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets – mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the mission began.
The last launch preparations on the Kepler space telescope are documented in the image.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that Mercury’s south pole also has ice.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the messenger circles far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have suggested for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
The messenger probe launched in 2004 – the first to orbit Mercury – has given scientists certainty.
Drinking Butter Every Day - and Becoming 168 Years Old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trail search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trail search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus roars over the winding road, past densely wooded hills, tearing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talyans, of which not much is known, except that they speak perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijani and are very durable.
End station is Lerik.
The small town boasts too heavy-handed Soviet-era architecture, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain scenery at all.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the access to Azerbaijan’s capital Baku is too cumbersome.
It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometers because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the things to do with the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the vita of about eight dozen talyans from the area, which are older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child was born.
But the museum’s controversial star is Shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented man who turned 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children; at the age of 136 he is said to have given birth to another daughter.
So did <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov reckon with a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also strikingly many high-aged people in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documentation, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially since there were no registers of persons.
Bechally melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a Biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Asian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyxians.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes it is food.
However, the fact that the calorie-rich diet of the talys should be so healthy, that they love meat, bread and especially dairy products and of which many drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butter barrel that she rolls tirelessly back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two young children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, guests can prepare tea, which is served in the typical, stomach-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth stand perfectly in row and limb, underneath her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I haven’t bought groceries at the supermarket.
Then she talks about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the aftermath of World War II.
But everything got better when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult driven by the father figure of the nation that ruled its country like a dictator knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan’s old people.
230 Manat (about the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount from which one can well live.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grayed son is right: "The old people enjoy great respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word “human rights” is missing in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with sharia as its basis is heavily controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save on Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is in my responsibility, in front of the people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all probably to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because they are all frightened, so far hopelessly disputed in a confused opposition.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of the Graces of the Mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi said he had, almost apologizing, temporarily cut the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers “to save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are aware of, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be dismantled?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were beaten by the Islamist-dominated 100-member constituent assembly in a 15-hour night parforce ride, are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does “principles” mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is fearful that the Islamists will use the fluffy formulation and the legal margins that come with it for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least one newly added article: in all matters concerning Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to, but it can mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which de facto would result in the disenfranchising of the judiciary.
Much in the draft draft is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: the civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts were used during Mubarak’s rule to oppress opponents.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
The state should also, according to the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morality and values".
This is so blurred legally that with the help of this article, government institutions could even control the contents of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing but censorship.
No article explicitly states the equality of men and women.
For this, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it is to be punished remains unclear.
Likewise dubious suggests the phrase "insulting people" is prohibited.
Is there enough of a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
It is a matter of interpretation, like so many things in the draft that Mursi is present for signature and that, according to his words, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unfamiliar unity on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, vowing to overthrow the charter before it can enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution belongs "on the garbage mountain of history".
On Twitter, he accused Mursi's supporters of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoneed," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, which would render it invalid.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to the counter-demonstration, but as a precaution not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other river in front of the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists participated in it, shouting, “The people demand the application of God’s law.”
They demanded of Mursi: "Clean the land!" and proclaimed: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would probably have instigated civil war-like conditions.
It was obvious that Mursi’s supporters didn’t want to risk this.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamist draft is considered safe.
“The word human rights doesn’t even exist.
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which should have gone by February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Morsi’s expansion of power to all three powers in the state led the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto overrides it,” Saeda said.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which considers the ideological struggle of direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns, "You are giving birth to a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most smelly fish in the world?
Norway’s five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living – not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty disgusting fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear.
And leave her there for a week.
The smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies, can be imagined.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and that stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-sprinkled trout, which, depending on how stinky you would like your fish to be, is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a feast here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, very brilliant specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire station, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk General".
People around us eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
“People like the aquavit more than the rakfisk,” says Havard.
The spirits can displace the smell.
I'm eating a few chops.
Avoiding bringing the Rakfisk near the nose is not bad - like sushi, which has a pretty long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities yet and fish was soaked in airtight salt water barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then removed after long fermentation and consumed - undoubtedly using alcohol-steamed senses.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians in search of work were forced to leave their country and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway not so long ago, immigrants are pouring in.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important – as an essential, if strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often make it into the world press, and most people don’t seem to bother it.
Here it is still hated to name Anders Breivik by name – those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "July 22 incident".
Norwegians struggle to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world has been primarily responsible for Norway’s present-day wealth.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress who distributes the round trays with mature Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Their English is impeccable just like most people here.
We're not very brave, we don't like boasting.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully – a large part of the industry’s revenues are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone was throwing around money they didn’t have, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and prepare for another dish - I have enough of Rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat bites me.
But in the evening the stinkfish is on the menu again.
The hotel I live in is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
They clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by aquavite.
But perhaps it is the strict haze of the whole fish.
Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
As Mexico’s future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his inauguration, the BBC’s Will Grant analyzes the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is a city that is always clogged, but on Monday a steel ring was erected that blocks several important traffic routes to the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
The goal, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential binding and take over the nation’s leadership.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the incumbent government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has proven itself economically well, but the country is under the grip of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Pena Nieto served as the governor of his home state, Mexico, before he went on par with the US president.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represent a great improvement compared to the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with his name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to make real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who serves as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, which works for PRI.
In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The opposition’s accusations that the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of decisive urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was deployed to combat drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the past two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left in a patch of land near a large dump.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for their violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not adequately addressed the problem of women’s murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case scenario, his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the decayed neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body had been washed,” recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the corpse starch had already set in.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is attached next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But this is exactly what the family has been denied so far.
The authorities treated me as if I were a talker, a troublemaker, a troublemaker.
They want you to simply accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form errors and omissions,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the Presidential Binding on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this issue during his term.
“I hope that as president he will be the way he was as governor,” said Olvera, a member of the PRI Congress in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear this the most.
Prosecutors say Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
Prosecutors disagree with Bradley Manning's allegations that he was abused in prison
Hearing deals with Manning's time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the indictment due to excessive conditions of imprisonment
US Army soldier accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor's office on Friday attempted to find that Army Brigadier Bradley Manning - charged with the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history - missed several occasions to complain about the alleged mistreatment he suffered in military detention.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning’s nine-month imprisonment in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a defense request to deny the indictment - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard detention - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officers had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had been held under tightened detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards to be "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, Fein said, did not contain complaints about abuse, even though officials had asked Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they would deal with them, but they had not been recorded.
“They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) ‘No problems,’ and that didn’t necessarily mean I didn’t say anything at all,” Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to downgrade his observational status to "prevention of injury".
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status – which is one level under suicidal risk – for his own and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and get rid of the observational status for injury prevention ... in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my view," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday that he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and was once unconscious due to the heat.
Not being allowed to know what was going on with him or in the outside world was a burden.
"My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell — at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours — and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning’s lawyer formally objected to Manning’s treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an accusation he had raised in his testimony on Thursday - so he had to sleep a night naked in his cell in Quantico and stand naked at a morning count in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
During the interview on Friday, Manning said he had closed an order from his guard that he should have dropped the blanket with which he could have covered himself, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the night before, trying to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning had told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his pants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his pants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his imprisonment should he be convicted at his trial in the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser offenses, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be challenged.
The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend and the prosecutor is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions applicable to all inmates held under the highest security precautions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence on the Internet, transmission of national defense information, and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he will face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when insanity spread within me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and have been called “Mexican” all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - exactly as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I chose "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I won’t get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for foreigners.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those themes that one expects when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans are just as likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc following the example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico’s war against the drug cartels, even though he did not give any details about it.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country’s gun leadership to leave more than half of its territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries rather than in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So once a U.S. government official makes even the slightest criticism of Mexico, you hear complaints — in the Mexican press and among the country’s elites — about how the Americans are pushing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma set out on the path of war.
And yet Mexico’s biggest challenge in truth lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at one point in our family tree a person—perhaps a parent or grandparent—was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may have now lived the American dream, attended good schools, and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class dislike us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have left.
And then we wouldn’t be trapped behind the silk curtain now – with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are – and Mexican Americans disgust them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel like they don’t belong to either country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to re-establish their connections to the diaspora.
They want to deploy Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" to Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We are to tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and to put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Oh, well.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unjust income distribution, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure if it’s really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a resentment for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmmm. (chuckles)
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the germ.
Amidst the usual blame, countless buildings have been laid in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time rockets have been deployed from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East around them is changing.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this mess.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance optimism seems far from appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, the fighting this week has strengthened the hard-boiled on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, claim to have pushed back the Israelis, despite the fact that its group itself suffered great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are trapped in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is winning in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders may conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, a resurgent, regional power once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has seized the party for Hamas – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that Israel is forming an Islamist crescent — from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels in an increasingly Islamist direction may face the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - the by far the strongest and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the secularist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the fraternity with Hamas is merged and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot even be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep quieter.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remains steadfast in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the blockade facilities that run into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state, protecting the Jewish settlements, which have been declared unlawful, but are still expanding.
Netanyahu's Likud party has joined forces with an even more fighting group in the run-up to the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these deceitful Palestinians, too, deceive themselves and leave them a state of their own?
If they really had control over the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their fellow Gazans?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to win, but the Arab spring could make a blow to them.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense state is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Morsi and Barack Obama have come together to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign — and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination — a powder keg that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli-occupied areas, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to push back Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is the one represented by the more sensible representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel designs territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop arms supplies to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab nations should also push Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute his part to pushing Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems he is also unwilling to participate.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia’s Unified Cigarette Packaging Laws Come Into Force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first unified cigarette and tobacco packaging laws came into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and infants and children who are sick from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small lettering, is from Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the world’s most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to stop young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who haven’t started smoking at age 26 are 99% more likely to stop smoking afterwards.
"You can see that even young children understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a slight impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the roads of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand for cigarette cases and silicone caps to cover the intolerable packaging has risen enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies two months ago contested the Australian Supreme Court's law.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is awaiting new inventories.
This is a good deal for us.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media lies with exactly the population group to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most traders to stop cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has switched to the internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Those who market tobacco and have only a small area left to promote their products don’t get around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has noticed an increase in reviews of brands written by “pretty ordinary people.”
You have to ask yourself the question: is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that they even record a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws instead of marketing.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries operates major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has been in talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a tilt and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box with a photo of a mouth tumor printed on it.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the “King of the Pack” tobacco trade in downtown Sydney, says the unified packaging has made it difficult to refill its shelves.
“It used to take me an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
"The government should have completely banned cigarettes - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing down," he added.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to think about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight half a day at the airport is pretty annoying – even when books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts point to boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us – and our children – to be bored occasionally.
Thus, the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting thought processes, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us these days are almost constantly staring at one screen or the other, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
No, no, no.
I'll come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see this as such.
“In fact, boredom has a very long history,” he says.
The house walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After long reading of research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom is the experience of "wanting to do a satisfactory job but not being able to do it."
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
With apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a “disruption of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only slowly passing by.”
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, even if we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Boredom from the Aspect of Attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume in front of a person's magazine article.
Some groups listened to a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content; others listened to it at low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear these noises at all.
The people who heard the hardly audible television reported feeling more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, could find no reason for them and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
Trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you are engaged in a monotonous activity - "like the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that rumblings and scribbles, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even combat it by keeping people physically more attentive.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hook around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a thundering loudspeaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored easier than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "boredom susceptibility scale".
On the scale there are statements such as “many things I have to do repeat themselves and are monotonous” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have enough time for everything.”
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys get bored more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida — particularly as it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a fairly relaxed pile.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and doing homework, while 23% reported being bored when they were not in school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is confident that "youth will be felt as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and turn to gambling or drugs to relieve them - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is from Professor Vodanovich, who has been exploring the subject for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to tell you to do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
If you’re bored and you use that energy to play and cook guitar, you’ll be happy.
However, television can cause feelings of happiness in the short term, but they disappear again in the long term.
So, if you give your bored child an iPad, it can distract him from boredom, but he has not learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: “Self-control is transferred from one situation to another.”
The child not only learns to talk, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we look too critically at them.
Instead, our goal should be to feel at ease even away from the constant activity and technology challenge.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we need to be bored more often, but boredom is the tormenting, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people in truth are just looking for a way to turn off and relax.
“In an environment where we are constantly over-stimulated, it’s hard to get busy once the noise is silent.”
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
19-year-old community college student and soccer player Anthony Orozco stands trial in southeastern Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in that state: the possession of a few fewer marijuana pieces and a pipe that he smoked them with.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug supplies - cavalier offenses each with a $100 penalty - and received a court appointment.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for own use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of legal violations revolving around marijuana have already been dropped here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer pursue adults over the age of 21 for possession to a small extent, which will be allowed by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have announced to continue prosecuting existing marijuana offenses and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
“This situation is evolving so fast that I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline in mind until December 1, 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states when it comes to the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited for guidance," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State's alcohol regulator.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We have no real precedent we can follow,” he added.
The Washington law, called the I-502, comes into force on December 6, and thus also forms the endpoint of a grey zone where the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified during this time - such as how to agree the state's requirement of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on cannabis businesses within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his staff in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offences against people over the age of 21, and that the police “from now on” would not seek criminal charges for these offences.
Chief Oates added that police would continue to enforce urban regulations to regulate medical marijuana growers and drug traffickers would continue to be persecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a more stringent view.
After the vote, he said his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to get consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people are held accountable for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other offences.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that at the time were crimes," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are divided even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer indicate adults for possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending possession proceedings.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana use with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state fostered a profound division among local officials in view of the great green experiment.
District attorneys are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver-based lawyer who represents defendants in court for marijuana offenses and acts on the ground as a spokesman for the national marijuana reform organization.
“They have spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting people for legalizing them that they still cannot accept legalization,” he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national standard cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several eye-catching arrests of medical marijuana consumers and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while criminal officers are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to avoid tolerating legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local municipalities approved moratories for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this law change.
We are based on what the community has chosen, not what the state has chosen.
Many questions remain open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
It’s not just today’s university students who are being attacked for their views.
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university, which I once considered to be the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College in the late 1980s – where I had planned to study history – I had packed my bags again and brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with classmates having sex in the neighboring room.
The author A. N. Wilson said that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my unusual name or because I came from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason – a reason that seemed so narrow-minded and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: my late father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I had been a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate-rights students is suffering from similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them demanded the same protection of equality last week that benefits gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They are demanding a seat on their college’s equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was exacerbated by a recently aired documentary about political students on BBC Two, “Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right,” which portrayed Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, it showed graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Student Association, who rode in a Rolls-Royce and rode in silver suit and silver-clad walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered “sinn goats for introducing higher tuition fees.”
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing tendency of left-wing universities.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without ever getting to know each other.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student at Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is “unpleasant.” 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the Oxford Conservative Student Association, says she has seen a growing rejection of moderate-rights students among JCR members.
“This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and members’ well-being,” she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even frightened Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even participated with pleasure.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled on it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite ugly.
“Do Thatcher fans refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?” he asked me.
The other students were giggling.
In my eyes there were tears.
"I suggest that they take a few French lessons in your free time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt murmured.
I went back to my room with my head hanging.
That evening, I was sitting alone in college at dinner, when someone slightly tapped me on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory will be harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father, Margaret Thatcher, is close, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
At a local pub, I later tried to make up my mind.
I insisted that I did not agree on all points with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and business who ironically attended the conservative Eton College told me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How did Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They're beating each other, aren't they?
I felt like gays had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me stretched before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of denial and isolation.
The only tutor to openly reveal himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who was based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-scale, and rejected it for its Marxist-deterministic perspective of history.
In 1997 he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said aloud.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends always showed up flawless manners.
His wet eyes blurred.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they'll just tease you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory supporter, had given in to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another history tutor had seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly ashamed, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to "brainwashing" and called them "old idiots."
The relief only lasted a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch Press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my hookers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weeping cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 Haute Couture dresses have been compiled, created by his "Maison" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the sticky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3, there will be a multitude of private letters and photos with the signature of the finest aristocracy, starting with Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love with the nobility doesn’t have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't put their tilts on your gorgeous carpet like some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went home to him for dinner after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
“Everyone who was invited felt important and loved,” recalls the “top model” who began her career at the Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
"He never gets out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60 meter long catwalk that proposes a role exchange: the user occupies the place of the model and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" that wears masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle's Manassi.
In this audience of fashion dolls radiate names such as that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I still remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," Feria's ex-duchess added.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underscore the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leader in fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that honors his name.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino doesn’t depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dresses "with absolute care" because "a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different embroideries and a four and a half meters long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society".
For years clouded with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honour of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honors as each of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg admits.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
“He was flawless; time leaves no trace on him.”
This is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals by Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it must climb down to the ground of its crater every day, where the sulfur-containing gas emanating from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilograms in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the steep paths of stone.
While it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb at the tortoise speed, keeping their balance and putting their steps carefully so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The mine workers at Kawah Ijen earn 5 eurocents for every kilo of sulphur they mine.
Arriving at the top, they make their way between the tourists, who photograph them like circus monkeys, and run with the weary baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and (never better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocent) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who usually does three routes a day.
For each route, it takes three hours, after which he is completely done, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhuman effort is three times what he would earn from field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where the coffee harvest pays 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees a day, and the work wasn’t that hard, but Anto and his family returned to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as sulfur: “I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindu, and I brought them to Java to convert them.”
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at risk for three years on the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already left his first traces, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
“I’m going to work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, but punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at a hotel, but instead he does the work of a tragedy.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other wearers and gets up every morning at two o’clock, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought for his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur mining to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive any part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera that the guards of this nature park together with the admission fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) demand from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human dragon.
"This work is for animals and not for humans," Madrusin, a stubborn 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school, protests.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he will continue “as long as he can” because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners jammed into the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders, which are damaged by the weight of the heads.
With the basket on his back, at 53 years old, Unainik is only more able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari 18 kilometers away.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” says Unainik, opening his mouth wide where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest at age 30 also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but the impoverishment continues generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: the one of those who work as a human load esel on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame the lack of children on their careers, the stress and costs of real estate and child-rearing.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civil duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candy, but nonetheless - or precisely because of - they became a viral video on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local proverbs such as "pushing a "bao" (laid) into the furnace to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, maintains the hope that the advertisement will reach out to the problem in a funny way.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to reproduction, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating nights (fast flirts).
Possibly many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, “Why don’t we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?”
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue lightly are the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for its rulers’ conservatism and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 — also known as the replacement rate — was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to “better education” and “greater career opportunities.”
“This has enabled people to have significantly more choices in terms of life goals and priorities than to marry and form a family,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of singles and delays in marriage and births, the result of which is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counter the population reduction led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the hardly concealed xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policy, the Singapore example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to make sure that not so many small apartments are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The City Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that are allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the lonely, and that they will deter construction companies from building large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate company EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidance to developers who had previously been put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for a rise in the national birth rate, talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they will have little effect.
"People are very stressed, the apartments and the education are expensive, which is why it is postponed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
“For me, it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women cite their careers, the stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That's why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - there's so much the government can do.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy policy
According to the dictionary, this is the property private or "that area of private life where you have a right to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to your daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he makes known situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15, who often travel online.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
“I wouldn’t reveal my deepest secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the meaning of “private” on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t of me or of someone making a fool,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of naked people, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assured to know 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I’ll just upload them,” he adds.
“The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or with friends,” he said.
Asked he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone offered him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask. In Ask, he admits to not knowing 20 of the people he has added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
No one made hints about the boy or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone pushes me or asks for them from me, I just remove them from my user account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with experiences that are now known as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he assured.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just made it private.”
After that, he explains a series of steps to configure a user account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I want to wipe one out of him.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and young people, it is necessary to understand that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
“The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,” she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
They are the digital natives, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them when we are still learning ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue “because we require them to have a defined criterion for what can be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is insufficient for it.”
“They should also be selective when it is most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
“Tell them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the internet?
Or: Would you like to have a photo of you posted like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission beforehand when you tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone have to know what you do at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educator, commented that it is indispensable that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all the sections, they have a solid foundation to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You must not talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the UNAZUR Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was theoretically to be signed by the seven present leaders.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially informed that they would hand it over after the exam, but later stated that it would be published on the Peruvian government's website at some time.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound with the message "private session, limited audio" was transmitted in the press room.
The few information circulated among the journalists was received by the press spokesmen of some of the UNAZUR governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, causing discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the Peruvian presidential office sent the media an e-mail with the "declaration of the conclusion" of the summit, which was the Humala declaration and not the official document concluding the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a press call, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was not published either.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be convinced that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed the existence of information systems for journalists, but they severely restricted access to information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which resolves a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting, confirming that they would accept the decision of the ICC, which begins Monday in The Hague, in the process of initiating Lima against Santiago, to hear the pleas of both sides.
“We will follow and execute the ruling on the differences we are currently bringing to this international court,” Humala said.
“Chile was, is and continues to be a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts,” added Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, greeting Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the ICC came after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, considered it a serious mistake, filed a lawsuit against the Bogotá Agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from unasur since 2011 after the removal of its president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The head of state read the final document, stating that 16 decisions have been made and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries have been set for a total investment of $17 billion.
He said the UNAZUR countries “will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are extending the decisions on residence rights.”
He said that measures would be pushed forward to “improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and against organized, transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters.”
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant traits, but should serve to expand our production output and show our people a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects designed to improve the spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas ... and thus unite our countries and develop new forms of economics," the Peruvian president said in a read statement.
Among these projects would be five Peruvian, which would lie on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which would provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve to re-establish it in the Union of South American Nations, from which it is currently excluded."
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before beginning his participation in the regional meeting, said that he expected a meeting with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime conflict with respect after a ruling of the ICC questioned by Bogotá.
"I may be meeting with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
"We will review all of these pathways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also necessitates talks with Nicaragua," he said.
"I hope to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this matter as civilly and respectfully as possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the country’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn about the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa confirmed today that creating a common citizenship is a goal, where “South America can actually learn something from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told Peru’s state television that Europeans “murdered each other in World War II and other conflicts” and “are practically a fatherland today.”
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that will push the member states of the UNAZUR.
"Free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redesign of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the guise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return we always sign South Americans everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States,” he said, referring to the political asylum Ecuador has granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles, but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time, “there were justified assumptions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his proceedings would not be followed.”
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to subject him to an interrogation on his territory for an alleged sex offense, while "Swedish jurisprudence allows this through a video conference that could have been conducted through the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental condition would be impaired.
“Since he’s been in our embassy, I haven’t spoken to him, but the ambassador informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one,” he said.
However, there is a risk that he will take physical and mental harm because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
“That would affect the health of every person,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution for the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London was the granting of a clearance so that he could travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeak.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a number of proceedings in various European jurisdictions,” he said.
And "if Britain grants this free letter tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish jurisprudence allows and was done in other cases, the problem is done.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate are “mediocrity, evil intent, and the lie that undermines free speech.”
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the bad and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated that Ecuador is no longer "dominated by such journalists, nor by bankers or hegemonic and shooting-bourgeois countries," and anticipated that in a re-election he would "deep the revolution in order to continue the path in that right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the UNASUR at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not give rise to opportunism or any coup d'état disguised as legal" because it "has destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and according to the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, to be "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
This is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a successful conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if both countries undertake to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard."
Regarding the possibility that he will stand as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he said that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the election in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never personally interested me, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to live up to that responsibility,” he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
“That’s decided,” he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to Vice President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, who told me that he had travelled there for planned, routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a relapse in the health of President Chávez," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State attended today in Lima the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with the call for higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of dying due to AIDS today is a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to be HIV-positive.
“It was like a bomb hit,” he says of the moment he was diagnosed, which the doctor tried to “weaken down without noticeable success.”
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to find out about it; and this with such dedication that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who are unaware of their disease and in whom the virus has already done damage and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG HIV unit.
Infectious Diseases and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that although AIDS is not a death sentence, years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the start of treatment, and that those who are not dependent on CD have a greater chance of CD of 200 years and up to 30 years.
Simply put, the above statements mean that whoever is diagnosed HIV-positive at the age of 25, in this sense "can easily turn 75 years old as long as he is under control," this expert explained.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011, according to the UNAIDS annual report), it is still true that 60 percent of patients recorded in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by the month of May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- So why are people still dying?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so it is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have had no problems with the supply of medicines. The problem is that people come to a far advanced state because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a concomitant infection. In order to affect global mortality, earlier diagnoses are required, which is why massive detection tests must be offered to all those who need to do so."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del AIDS en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients like Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, agree on this proposal for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him who had already been in the AIDS-like stage (and even had been a complicated) despite his young age.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and don’t want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
“I work, I do a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person,” says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today as part of the worldwide AIDS Day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken on the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; before they were given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among those at risk for new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you need this?" is a common mockery question from social workers, mentoring staff in schools, pharmacy workers and the healthcare system who do not want to expose themselves, the correspondent assured.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities that are frequently visited by young people.
Promise is not to be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like this; it’s best to bring condoms closer to those who are already engaging in sexual activity,” he said.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV.
92% of cases of infection occur through intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people in every registered case who do not know it.
After the U.S. Court of Appeal has upheld a ruling that fails to recognize the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an unfortunate precedent is created for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
So it could be said that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the June 15 recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale in Bancarrotas court for the northern district of Texas has resulted in Mexican companies being helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens doors to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, initially states that the main proceeding is the commercial bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with cross-border profiles is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformation of International Trade Law was created, using the American Law Institute as a mediator.
Second, the judgment determines that without the votes of the companies, after acknowledging the liabilities in the bankruptcy estate that Vitro’s branches had with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities to group companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concurso Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Bankruptcies).
It is also correct that, after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who sued Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation from 2008 onwards as part of the great economic crisis in the United States that hit the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family appeals to the same Court of Appeal to ensure that the vote takes place in the plenary, i.e. of all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If it is not granted, Cerciorare’s appeal is filed, which requires review of the proceedings by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the court has set aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure amicus curiae (friend of the court) describing the proceedings carried out by Vitro under the Trade Bankruptcy Act, and pointing out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded caramboles: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican air transport unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, did not progress for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Association of Pilots) has finally made progress.
Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau’s request has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of impeding the judiciary.
After that, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic about a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE under the name Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is encircled
At a weekend meeting at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the Wall, complemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has reached the goal of uniting the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental institution, which partly destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to the industry.
Acta is dead.
Because the government failed to comply with a request from the Senate to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement known by the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place despite the fact that the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it saw them as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long-term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without compromising short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is launching stock market certificates of over 500 million pesos.
The issuance is the first of four equal issuances that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Founding of Competival
Created from the leading information technology companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, a group of companies was formed under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is more than $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world hiker, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been linked to basketball for more than 60 years and has travelled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the country's basketball history as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, representative and leader of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"I have put on many hats in basketball throughout my life, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those reminiscent of his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as a co-CEO or managing director of the club.
“These were my best years I’ve enjoyed the most because I’ve been part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as a CEO, co-CEO or coach.
It was many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very strong and 2m player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide for another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and that of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the U.S. at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
“Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we took fourth place in what should have been bronze if it hadn’t been for this Canadian referee who had us repeat the last round for the second time,” Reyes said.
Was this group from the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight to the US team, like when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz) were back on that team, but also the young players (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the players blocked because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated as much on this level as Piculín.
And this without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the bandage?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which comprised the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things that I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, the children make unnecessary travels and games.
At least I see the result of the required training and courses for trainers, table officers and referees.
That's what I'm proud of.
What are you doing today?
I love listening to music, watching videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of “Dallas,” died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of “Dallas.”
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died at the Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "chin" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His films included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly disgusting J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot J.R.?", which was meant to create expectation for an episode full of emotions where Hagmann's character was nearly killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered at betting houses.
The series reached a spectator record at that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had swallowed her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city. But others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and disloyal husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) admitted.
"I know what to put on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should read, "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he has not won.
Victoria Principal, the actress of the original series, remembered Hagman as a "huge personality on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshippers in the world and remains preserved in our hearts for us who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on TNT television channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just shot, the station informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how Hagmann’s loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on theater stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their homes.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything that I thought could hurt anyone or hurt them in any way,” the Associated Press said.
After the liver transplant, he advocated for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I will meet with them when their operations come and after," he said in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of the course studying the "end of the world"
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester when the religious professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long backcount” on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called “deudarmageddon,” as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which Christian theorists believe the apocalypse is beginning.
“I didn’t realize this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor to offer courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which was supposed to be the last in history.
In Temple, assistant professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and looked at how they could be compared to real life.
“I tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
At the University of Pennsylvania’s main campus, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course called “The End of the World.”
“We don’t take 2012 so we always have the option to keep the price going again in case the world doesn’t go down,” Restall said.
Despite the "previous downfall", students must study, create projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is conducted on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than to continue working until the night, where the world is supposedly ending," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more places," Restall said of his high-average student course, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students who asked if there were still free spaces.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is among the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually just a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, says he’s seen all of the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a class where this is taught,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed – and even less a professor – said they believed in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in certain ways we discredit it,” said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that goes back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
“People don’t think that way elsewhere,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course on the "end of the world" there.
“The Philippines are not participating at the end of the world,” he wrote as an indication of an exception from a higher body.
We have a pardon from the pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been spoken of the Last Judgment, saying that if nothing happens on Dec. 21, “people will immediately think of a new date” or philosophize that Dec. 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world will come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about “the end of the world.”
“Maybe I’ll call a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student of communications.
