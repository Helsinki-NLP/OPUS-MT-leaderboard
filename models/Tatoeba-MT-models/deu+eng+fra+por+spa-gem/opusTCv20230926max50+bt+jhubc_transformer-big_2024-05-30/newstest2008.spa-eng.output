European Inflation Has Slided on Food
Accelerated inflation in the euro area is first and foremost due to the dizzying rise in food prices.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, registering - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Luxembourg-based Union Statistical Office.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent likely, Bloomberg said.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest rate on the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and reduced forced unemployment, would trigger an inflation spiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: “negotiating” on inflation so that it doesn’t have to intervene later on.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, broke the twelve-year record; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation soared in the euro area as a result of fast-paced food and energy prices.
Wheat premiums rose by 88 per cent and soybean premiums reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching black gold as early as last month almost $100 a barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, but by 2009 it will already drop to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to double interest rates in 2008.
Gallup predicts government crisis
After a long stagnation, by the beginning of December the support of the Young Democrats Alliance increased significantly, reaching its peak level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of safe party voters - due to the greater firmness of opposition voters - would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) support versus a fifth of support for socialists (20 percent).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary scandal: their support within the entire population is 2%.
Among safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous low - it has never been higher, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is pretty bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population is deteriorating and only one-tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the President of the Government is performing poorly rather than well.
13 percent of respondents trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of respondents.
54 percent of the population does not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent does not trust the president of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the shaping of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced with the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 percent estimated that it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, today this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation answered that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said it is likely to participate.
By way of comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" only 55 percent of the population would participate and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of paying school fees, 79 percent would disapprove of the medical consultation service, and 84 percent would disapprove of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of education fees, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has fivefold its prices
The average rise in the price level of 16 percent was maintained by the hypermarkets of the Budaörs golden trade triangle, with the difference that VAT has not been raised this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs golden trade triangle the Napi newspaper’s usual Christmas basket, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth well above 1,000 HUF.
Since prices in food supermarkets had already “shot” in December last year, there was no dramatic percentage increase in price compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below nine thousand HUF, today they can not do it for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost HUF 6,800.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with redeemable bottle of two liters cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan’s basket it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora rose by 15, while Tesco and Auchan rose by about 18 percent the prices listed in the Napi basket.
Comparing last year’s most expensive basket values with this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while growth between last year’s cheapest basket and this year’s most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during Christmas last year in prices you felt the increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that shattered trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of circulation of a product, you may lose a significant profit on the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF than the value recorded in 2006, while the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year such extremes did not occur, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of basic consumer goods grew by more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some staple foods, recorded over the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30 percent.
So for example, besides wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was registered, in the worst case only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose the drastic price increase even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the golden trade triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our collected experiences, most of the consumers of the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, the preserved foods being carried by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, big queues were formed in front of the boxes in all three stores because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that within the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because income falls below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, primarily caused by the misuse of antibiotics.
The hygienic circumstances in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overload of staff do not favor infection control, says the doctor-head of the department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, an MRSA contagion was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
An injured person in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital shortly after as a result of the infection with MRSA and since then has not been able to perform an important surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, medical department head of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents has certainly been recorded, of the rest there is no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
A third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is exaggerated or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics turn into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and quickly spread under inappropriate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or sepsis in the first place in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with weakened organisms, in the elderly or in people with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about the infection of MRSA, these infections are everyday in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - Tibor Nyulasi said - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
“These patients are isolated, nursing staff are caring for them in rubber gloves and mask and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment,” Tibor Nyulasi said.
Hospitalized patients are screened for the presence of MRSA in their body, but even so, infection cannot be avoided in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital MRSA infections in most cases, however current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of formation and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not fashionable.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when the visible MRSA infections in the patient already occur, said the head of the medical department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict entrustments for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and national directives also exist to treat infections and pathological conditions.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of ambulant patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
Save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is contagious from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, however also in this sense considerable shortcomings are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is contagious through droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
What’s more, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favourable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where adequate preventive measures are followed, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the contagion of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is fought in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the district police commander of XXII has been made.
The possibility that drove drunk or in a stunned state can be excluded the since resigned commander of the police of district XXII, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passerby - said Friday Attila Morvai, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary blood alcohol control that had already found that the former police commander did not drink alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then-Chief of the XXII District Police Station, on Tuesday in his private vehicle as he folded into Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII District, hit a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(This latter fact, i.e. that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The passer-by lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police chief resigned and requested retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Prosecutor’s Office of Investigation.
Attila Morvai also said the former police commander initially collaborated with prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
€400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of 400 million euros to finance infrastructure in education, transport and the environment, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of 300 million euros to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, which will be realized from the subsidies of the Cohesion Funds, of which the parties had previously signed a loan contract worth 100 million, the contract they have just signed refers to the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective of Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million the decision will be taken later, by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a €50 million contract for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the topic of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalized the details of Metro funding with the EU, they will re-discuss the issue of whether or not to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest rate of the loans is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period, with no fee to keep the loan available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
It is admirable the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who buy in the EU’s even cheaper market, which will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on the ski slopes and villas on the beaches.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches of Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Coast of the Sun", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Likewise, the capital Sofia can be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is on its best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a highlight destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the surroundings of Bansko.
According to analysts, those who buy property in Bulgaria are also striving to change their life and way of living.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot developers are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in skiing paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, in addition to them the proximity of a big city, shops and usually a local doctor is important.
In the second category are buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in the month of December was included in the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group is real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital property is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate considerably outweighs the growth of wages.
Fodor and the Six by Hundred Hungarians
As reported by the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor the meetings at the expert level will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue the negotiations at the ministerial level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are deliberating on the Ballistic Roadmap, which provides for post-emissions reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in effect until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the subject between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on precise figures at the moment, although it tends to come to an agreement that compared to the 1990 situation, until 2020 the emissions of greenhouse gases responsible for the effect will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing or unwilling to offer material and technological aid to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on the assistance to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
The Six by Hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU pledges to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020, from the 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed and is willing to commit to a reduction of even 30 percent if the world's other major developed regions and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol pledged to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states pledged to meet an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary’s commitment is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 6 percent over the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply with - says the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
There is much that is at stake in Bali, since in two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because otherwise, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed to after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new scientific international emission reduction system, whose need was warned in its most recent IPCC report.
As a result, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2oC in Earth’s average temperature could not be prevented, a fact that scientists say would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army Recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor post recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
The British Air Force (RAD) first took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar’s general operating corps, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been uploaded to the Internet and their "channel" has already been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defense headquarters" and publishes videos of actions perpetrated in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operations in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to introduce the public to the true purpose of the British army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional television recruitment spots - said defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'être of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made a video game.
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, there are also amateur videos on the distributor, for example on the death of the soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, without presenting however the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet, but the British military is only recently seizing this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with free downloadable shooter video games, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can be put directly in place of the soldiers.
Salty tombola and cake at ministries Christmas party
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so power is fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defense, but not for the workers of the Ministry.
On Orphans Christmas the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for Missionary Christmas the relatives of the soldiers who are currently carrying out missions abroad are invited. A reception for the press will also be offered.
This portfolio will allocate $25 million for the festive atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party regarding the parties of the other portfolios
The MET festival will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and the ministry’s six hundred workers are expected to be around three hundred and fifty.
At the wallet party there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also be performing and there will be a draw of tombola.
The ANF Christmas cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theater.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a costume
The CNAJ building hosted not only the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated Lucia’s day dance on December 7.
The CNAJ did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s greetings and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
The health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
Instead, Labour Minister Monica Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty guests are invited to drink only coffee and salty cake, as reported by the press department, so the party will not cost more than 350,000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai instead will simply toast with his colleagues in the Ministry of Local Governments and Territorial Development classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own hall of events with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the reception with buffet and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20, at the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and as reported by the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are celebrated every year, begin with a brief greeting speech by the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments communicated to [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry ' s Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held in the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will form a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will take place on Saturday, while Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will take place - will begin unemployment.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since rail traffic will be completely stopped and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Public Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike to be held jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Engineers will also be formed, which will coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protest rally will take place on Saturday, while participating unions will strike indefinitely on Monday if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law, they did not report the date of the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call to strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only the public health law will be voted on in the very early hours of the night, or perhaps near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways will be stopped work indefinitely, in the morning some of the Budapest public transport and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the Volán companies may be stopped.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League website.
Some unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Rail Workers (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on minimum services, although as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the start of the day until 1 p.m., the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, the Budapest Airports will be on strike from 7 to 9 a.m., a four-hour strike will be held by the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical and Thermal Energy Industry, the Educators' Trade Unions called the Educators' 2 hours strike.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will strike at alternate hours and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) which are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is for the government to withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will come into effect next year.
The third is to ensure that, even before 2010, in the case of advance pensions, occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the rail sidelines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
The company’s “risk warning” states: “In relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is the fact that with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur.”
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the provocation of an event of this character," added the representative of the research institute.
They affirmed that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the gypsies problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the differences between gypsies and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country".
They remind us that: since autumn 2006 the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups in Hungary has received increasing publicity and momentum, and that since summer 2007 numerous self-defining organisations have been established in the country as "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civilian organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, i.e. the state," they add.
They affirmed: all this occurs in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
For highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but at the same time is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
In recent months, many neighboring states have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a manner similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the mass Roma riots that took place in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent in the face of the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that some Gypsy organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will form their own guard.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard until now has shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also the Gypsies of Hungary react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, told the news agency: “Risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence risk change, they inform public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their risk warning.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around holidays - which next year will be less - workdays are reorganized.
Even in the EU or in North America the holidays are not unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holidays, state holidays and public holidays.
The festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical ephemeris.
We celebrate the New Year also: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is a holiday - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15, commemorating the revolution of 1848, and on October 23, commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August we celebrate the foundation of the State, on the 1st of May the feast of labor, on the 1st and 2nd of November we remember our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country are two-day feasts the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for such extended weekends, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the labor minister who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 practically stops life in the country, since according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with mid or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda around the Labor Day will be modified so that the workers can rest for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26 will be working day, so in return Friday, May 2 is a holiday.
The other change relates to the feast of October 23: Saturday, October 18, will have to work instead of Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, the coming year during the holiday of the end of the year will be able to rest, since from the 24th of December almost nowhere will be worked, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six small deterrents to make your colleagues’ lives bitter
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that pass us without realizing: they are all part of our everyday folklore at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to the small discomforts or consciously avoid the confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
Sorry, I forgot to let you know that you’ve been searched for from the marketing department,” says one of your colleagues.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to fix the matter, he may call the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to give you the message (this is the less usual solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to shameful explanations, it is worthwhile to meditate on the things with which you can bitteren the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, an office utility, or your phone and you can’t find them.
Do you remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your missing pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly get angry with you for stealing their stuff.
Do not take envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out early.
Gossip about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what is he doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t pass on to everyone the information you have about the private lives of your colleagues!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even though others also know the things about him.
Are you going on sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or well, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others must do your work, your imposterable tasks, your work in the end.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen, so you will have to stay home, tell them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront your absence the next day.
Tarareos, laughs, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but are you suddenly getting ridiculed by your colleagues?
Have you involuntarily heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to hear it?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your humming, singing, conversations out loud (less when you do them above their head), kicking, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not delving into a project at this time (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something in time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
Don’t allude to the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that hurts others and you must repair the mistake!
Ask how you can fix your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and sneakers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be messed up, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, stylish and beautiful clothes when your occupation requires it!
Lose interest if you want to meet audience expectations
The car moves slowly in the usual morning jam.
It sounds a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I turn up the volume.
Change the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a real jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
National music life didn’t spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam seems totally different when you're listening to Zagar's new album.
Some interesting new songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and although the garage style rock, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has proven: there are novelties under the sun.
Balázs Zsager began his career in the city of Pécs, played in the ensemble of Yonderboi until he began his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the set that initially only performed in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trendsetter, able to be sold also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his outfit are in fashion, but no one has asked them if they wear this label or not.
The ensemble reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the early years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient ensemble of Balázs Zsager.
It's okay the reference about the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airyness of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds loudest, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album on the Millenaris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a real hit from the mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi channel, which lately broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station carried to the ears of the radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zsager.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are performing, to what extent is it a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called subterranean alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, making it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the West, light music has greater traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years frequent concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course, I feel good to see more and more people attend our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the audience, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career rather to the West of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our works to Yonderboi’s music, as many of us started our career in their group and from there we embarked on another path.
hvg.hu: In the mr2 hit list Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people heard Zagar’s name for the first time in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great hits and sell our record with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it at the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the album and the heavier tracks.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a choir in the gospel style.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of good-voiced soloists from our own national musical stage.
That choir of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - was created and later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you make the song exactly that way or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in an instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came practically at the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I needed the Divas as well.
With my voice it wouldn’t have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the record it seems like the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay’s short solo), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and not more strongly than music, so the music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on the stage they are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical issues.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song is also about it, about forgetting our ego for a while, that who came from and where it goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted to make others feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What did you do the most work for?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition there were actually none, rather when it came to mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time the groove didn't want to work and then, little by little, everything was put in place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already "released" the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A misleading disloyal.
This is what he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Commercial Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
It has long since, unlike all the major Czech banks, perceived the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s responses to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, reveal, is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he said in his replies.
In the summer, he managed to earn 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity already saw it coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had trouble with payments and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, its profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I already won my first $500 million I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, that nothing has been left to himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery would not be reached.
He even deceived the bosses, even when the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
The risk became a benefit
Was he afraid it would be discovered?
Rather, no.
“I thought I had made $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.”
Where did you get so much willpower to take that risk?
In my position I had to work gradually.
He went to work at Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary ranged from $51,000.
Two years later he was an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I was never going to win as much as everyone else.
“In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that I was being watched with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company, the first great success came.
Thanks to the shares of Allianz he won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a startup mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
“This is like a snowball,” police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew all of this or rather suspected it.
"While I was making money, they closed their eyes."
Only then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase every footprint.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they find him?
He became suspicious after his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a vacation is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his file,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of obtaining 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Republic government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kronor).
This is almost half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will come out of seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund which next year will have an amount of 90.8 billion kronor.
The Business and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies for obtaining resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
Regarding the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly entered countries that use them least.
Twenty-year sentence for former president of Nicaragua, court ordered
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday decreed the 20-year sentence for the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 for the misappropriation of 100 billion dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest at his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is again in jail.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, will rather depend on the prison officers if they let Alemán finish his sentence at home or if they get him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated that German was constantly transferring government money to a company account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Some of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to fund his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The state budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the government’s vote of confidence, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional yet most influential view, calmly passed the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Every government begins and ends with every chapter and every budget item, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the Social Democrats' last governments suffered from three shortcomings that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of the presidents who are not only pensions but also social benefits that were already approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit in public funding, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the state budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, besides the money from the taxes, fees and credits of the banks, often emitted, senselessly, bonds with which they indebted disproportionately to their municipalities.
In recent years, they managed to pay off these debts through the mass sale of energy stocks and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
Currently they do not have this resource.
If we stick only to official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, which <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put order to the finances of the state.
Instead, however, the state continued to indebted.
Other countries, except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, on the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for mass social programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years have been vainly swollen with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if it doesn’t soon change the retirement age and pension reform then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, governing whoever governs will only be a mere bureaucracy.
By exaggerating it a little, we can say that the politicians who govern will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure from the normal expenses of the presidents’ expenses.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, had the past government not wasted what it could in the last ten years.
We would not want the politicians who govern to become only officials, so we must be patient and grant to this weak government coalition, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and fees, tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.
Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Krej<0xC4><0x8D>í
The banks want to solve the crisis.
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the Monetary Marking, more than one hundred billion dollars will be received through tenders.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars to bid, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest economic problem, namely the continued growth in the shortage of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his client report.
“This coordinated action by central banks is likely to decrease the recession in the United States by 65 percent to fifty percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks should really be afraid of what lies ahead when they decided to take this step,” said ABN Amro’s senior economist Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems in accessing loans and that they will therefore have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate that is used for lending money on the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid of borrowing money even when the central banks of the U.S., Canada and Britain lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," Tempus Consulting's Greg Salvaggio told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus reiterated the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now emerged with the closure of the U.N. international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
“The debates there are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to today’s problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this topic is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "many times I find only the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now learn about their various opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
She is academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that climate change is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
In addition, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained to the questions of those present that he is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the cost-benefit relationship".
Klaus talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed the date and therefore did not manage to change their old driver's license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change for officials to give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid card will be found on the roads.
According to traffic, the card has not changed mainly those who do not even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of cards, the offices of the metropolis are filled with applications and interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates about 2,000 customers daily.
In the queues wait a half hour.
Around 140,000 drivers have not yet taken out the new card in Prague.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who are obliged to change their card and do not reach the end of the year, but will go on the roads without a valid card will risk a fine starting in January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police officer can fix the offence with a warning.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine will be 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a person who does not go anywhere could be fined.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to moderately enter fines of a maximum of 1,000 crowns.
According to the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, fines of 1,000 crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver’s license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should hand over their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will gradually have to change the other types of driver’s licenses.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
Court Reduced Sentence for Berdych's Complicit Detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych are going to spend thirteen to ten years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided as a definitive expiry the reduction of the penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives in the Prague Department of Organized Crime were originally going to be between 14 and 12 years old.
Today’s decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is waiting in the first place for the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this, in other cases he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement in the robbery of 19 people and the High Court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants’ accusations were rejected by the investigation because they were fabricated cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped members of the criminal group avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their robbery to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The indictment relates to criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
Regarding the theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts but are also charged with abuse of power as public agents and without gun permits.
In the home registry, police found guns, ammunition with a steel core, a laser guide and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this case, the court has already convicted Berdych and other defendants.
Other men related to Berdych's case are still declaring other processes, and in some causes have not yet appeared.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change a few children: 12 million
For changing children in the maternity home, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, does not agree in principle with Veleba's proposal.
“Such a demand we don’t approve, it’s too high,” Dostál said after today’s meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty had investigated.
We'll find out if it has rescissory value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for everyone,” Dostal said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>’s family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist’s report, except that it was prepared at the hospital of the Motol faculty in Prague.
The parents of the girls, according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry, suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depths.
The stressful situation was best endured by the men although they fought with recriminations for the change of the girls.
Women are getting worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, said Veleba.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by the nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> Maternity House last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermákový to P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
The governor of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, gave each family 100,000 crowns at the end of October as compensation for the mistake made in the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily ask for help from the administrator.
The court to date has recognized them with a proportionately low compensation, the amounts that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polivka lost the lawsuit over the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with whom the actor collaborated.
Polivka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polivka," Polivka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, faced with the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone comes to the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We’ve had about 10 years of work behind us.
Searching for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that I could therefore also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the brand Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Polivka in his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about guiding him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comedic origin it became a business and a profitable business activity from which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> later created the company Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also ruled that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used a simple idea that Polivka made public on the stage for her own business benefit.
“It is clear that Bolek Polivka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia,” the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves entirely to it.
The collaboration, between the now decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Polivka the official coronation in Vsetin.
From that moment conflicts began to arise between Polivka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> whose culmination came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the forever elected".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, resulted in the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed an indictment against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his society, which to this day has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with his princesses, which is already preparing Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The new king should come out of him.
You didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
“We have no rush.
It would have to be something like the king's road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polivka can present himself," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its gear characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuvering and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just have to think better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I complained, for example, of the headboard space in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer from the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I walk through the interior quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more the invention of design although already the car looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the model 206, the lateral steering has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the body measures have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned shortage of space in the header disappears.
Suitcases to the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
This should be rated as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear door) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps which are an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in the basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot is behind with its noticeable 52 liters.
On holidays abroad or when placing the stroller of the child its value is critical.
But if I have to comment on something positive then I must quote the floor that is quite flat after pulling down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition on a capacity of 1.6 l and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's what a 1600 that despised the familiar five doors should look like.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the <0xC5><0xA1>koda back then which seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a cloth, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition from 1400 for 329,900 crowns, you can still.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the headboards, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, it costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but have the team's add-ons in Fabia and you'll reach a pretty similar number.
Now it remains to be decided which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend and for this reason, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between emigrants and children of natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and anger among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that police in Chatmam arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with insults of a racist tone.
Police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls teased him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
“When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to quit, he made a move to throw us apples and pears, and then he pulled down his pants and showed us his butt,” he described another nasty incident for The Times, the Slovak student’s mother.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with emigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools starts to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can come true, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the whole included with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island you can find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the stronghold of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of cargo for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He was ordered to build one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the US (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings emerged, on wide avenues ran cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the show world and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita Abanense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you are mixed cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already cult of the 1950s, until today continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rusted between these humid and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surrounding area as there.
Other places metamorphose in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money needed, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and is highly valued by railroad lovers.
Sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow tracks in steam or electric machines.
Their carriages for tens of years were not discovered and are now there, machines that work and whose sister models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
There is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway estate there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not fail to visit it.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing in limestone rock lands.
Mogotes, limestone piles and rocks of high steep in the falls of the valley, and in their caves are acclimatized fertile lands thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the Havana cigar factories you can find your final product.
Perhaps someone finds it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
Old abolengo town that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought it fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is such a remote place that still in the 50s of the last century there was no road to connect it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth visiting interesting places in the nearby area such as Ancón Beach or the valley of the sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which with its music animates the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
This view is surely already confirmed by the very way.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and which now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of Copper, the Santeria, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, could be filled with many pages.
However, as they say, it’s better to see him ever.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment is what is influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defense Minister Robert Gates, should devise a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it was thought, agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland) representatives of countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to step up, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the Afghan government’s authority and share development aid.
“Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next step is to enable the population to start economic and security development on their own,” Defense Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
According to U.S. military data, the activity of the Afghan rebels is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew by 27 percent compared to last year, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
Exactly they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to seriously think about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months is the controversy over whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For passive was criticized, for example, Germany.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands for fighting there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist Sun newspaper this week called the German soldiers vague.
“The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are engaged in playing while our boys are fighting,” Sun wrote in an accompanying footage of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops played a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will reach a trillion in 2009
For each Czech the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt in September amounted to 842.7 billion crowns.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement in the evolution of the economy of the state budget.
The Czech Republic’s state debt grew to 842.7 billion kronor at the end of September.
In nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the state in early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state borrowed more than 111 million crowns.
“For now it seems that thanks to next year’s low deficit we could cross the trillion-corona border until 2009.
Next year the debt is expected to move between 900 billion and a trillion crowns,” said iHNed.cz, the economist at Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, Next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora said: “We could spend the trillion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don’t yet know.
If the situation on the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to the year 2010.
But I don’t see such a change,” he added.
The doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The debt of the state is paid by means of treasury bonds, government bonds, direct credits or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s internal debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kronor.
The foreign debt for now has grown from 1.7 billion kronor to 123.3 billion kronor.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z kroner since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of state debt increased by 6.5 years.
“The total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand shows that it will be negotiated until there is a reform of the pensions," said Pikora.
Better than expected
From the state’s debt management and payments strategy for 2007 it is extracted that the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kronor this year.
At the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to improved developments in the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the planned 91.3 billion crowns.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about 13.3 billion kronor, the reserve of 10 billion kronor for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kronor to finance state obligations and 1.8 billion kronor in payments of loans from the European Investment Bank.
He was comparing Khartum today in court for giving a name to a teddy bear.
The British professor tried in Sudan for insulting Islam has been sentenced Thursday afternoon by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting pupils aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is illicit.
He was subject to a whiplash penalty.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with attacking Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints by parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 out of 23 children have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself did not wear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, “I’m just sorry that I asked the children to vote for a name,” it was only an “innocent mistake.”
Opinion divided by numerous pupils of the school teacher who describe her as " very attentive to her pupils " and " who never speaks of religion in class " ..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child in a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the statute," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was “at stake,” his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “clear tensions exist”.
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated by 90% Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on a pursuit of negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, the Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in her favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," announced the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where these "last chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has expressed some of his grief.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations.”
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered a compromise to be always feasible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade said it particularly feared a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be made exclusively by the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto.
" Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush opens deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he met Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally reached agreement on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old litigation point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” by the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both parties to their obligations regarding the peace itinerary they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority presided over by Abbas would attempt "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues " .
This denomination covers the three main problems of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “global and deepened” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
On his return to the platform, Olmert pledged that the upcoming negotiations would be "direct and continuous" and that he would make "an effort to conclude them over the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the end of the implementation of his " vision of two coexisting Palestinian and Israeli States " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment in this regard on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in return for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks “a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” said Prince Saud in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As always in these kinds of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspection of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17, Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and it was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating light," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not homologated, or not authorized to drive on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " on all gas " .
"He struck the police car on the left side, after a breach of the yield the step to the right," police said.
Alcohol control practiced on the occupants of the vehicle was shown to be negative.
The state of the car (the front unfounded, windshield cracked, bumper torn off) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into " acts of involuntary homicide and denial of assistance " to the IGPN, colluded with the departmental directorate of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor pointed out that the IGPN investigation at this stadium ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the police, namely that this mini motorcycle arrived relatively quickly to his left " .
Yesterday, a type of groove, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the footwear on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been recessed by the time for the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical examination.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, not thus providing relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also remove " any serious fault " in this regard.
"It's the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs further investigations, about which you have to be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of its windows that precisely overlooks the scene.
"We immediately went down to the hospital with my cousin, who is a nurse, to try to revive them," said this witness.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw "a completely frightened cop, limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the youngsters, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen have been driven by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, relief arrived "about twenty minutes after the police march".
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first demonstrations since the imposition of a state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stones, wounding policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen loaded and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers demanded a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent clustering.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday picked up the support of the religious parties regrouped into the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "exhorted the population to send flowers to judges who ruled against the state of emergency and the waste to whom they swore oath before Musharraf."
“Musharraf’s promise no longer fulfills”
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential election, on 6 October, by indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
“Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's pledge to leave the head of the army and to become a civilian president "values no more" after the establishment of the state of emergency, said the assistant minister of information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant minister of information also confirmed that the elections in January could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of armies.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not predicted, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better " mastery of fertility " , according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has fallen from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less per month for a couple in five and if possible for the spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) will have needed more than seven hours of space work to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel that is indispensable for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "capped" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts had released from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece in charge of soon hosting European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see framed).
This module is a type of landing platform for modules-laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to displace a 17.5-ton solar panel power module already on the ISS in order to put it in its final position.
After having displaced it, the crew began the reorganization of the module’s solar panels that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that’s where one of the panels, which are deployed as accordions, has been damaged by a little more or less than a meter by a cable that pulled off.
Deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to perform a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snail at the end of the 30-metre length of the shuttle's remote-controlled arm added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Tall, sturdy, very skillful, has very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained doctor has been tasked with "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After accurately inspecting the damage, he sectioned the fallible cable and installed types of "boards" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second "spacewalker" who had stayed near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in an insulator to prevent electrocution in solar panels producing several hundred volts, has been conceived and "captured" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making an inventory of his instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for their return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS stock is currently down sharply to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group has announced that it will tend to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been obliged to revise its operational outcome forecast for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditiones the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the mother house of the European builder EADS.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new operating earnings targets (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly earnings next Thursday, adds without any more encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new burdens is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be remembered that the operational result of EADS failed by 86 per cent in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to the delays of another programme, that of the very thick A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, on the way out of the polls: the Russians are going to massively opt for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming its aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message about public networks, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not allow anything to be transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident,” he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Zjouganov says there has never been such a dirty election, until in the time of Eltsin.
After the crackdown on last weekend’s demonstrations, former world champion jack Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, visits are banned, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, to the legislative elections as well as the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians guarded the homo soviticus mentality, they don’t feel they own their destiny,” says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putine re-established the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved it after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old teacher: " Why reflect?
Those in power aren’t too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now openly accessible.
The 47 million archive documents, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were thus far not available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his rightful holders.
The eleven states in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to searchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow searches "particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced labourers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, objected to the opening to the public of these personal documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, eventually, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches around 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union's foreign ministers had approved last April the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will dope both economies" and "India would improve its entry to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services ", had declared this week Barièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that the European Union's bilateral trade " has not yet reached the L-

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was worried about easing the current return of concerns over credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer at the base index of 5.75% in five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
“To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the holding period beginning on December 6th in the form of an open market operation for five weeks,” it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It’s the first time it seems that Bank England BoE puts liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market trade.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is "prepared to take further steps to keep the interbank lending indices " up to date with its baseline index.
The daily interbank index was 5,829 per cent on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny examination of PS party propositions on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the increase of 50% of the bonus for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP (international rate for oil products), a check-transport or restrictions on rents.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that resulted in exchanges, sometimes live, between majority and opposition a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the bill of rectifying finance discussed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more and no less, the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place August 8-10 on a private 500-acre farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now host up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a marketplace and worked with perseverance with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we stagnate in low-level policies because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival at an exceptional venue that lately will take place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 in Chicago’s Grant Park, after having debarked in the festival scenery in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are mostly held in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of country festival in the European way and urban in the American way. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but affirms " that they are quite interesting to allow investing in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life " .
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer at this festival is "very big", like 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It’s not easy to lure Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to compete with the governor?
“We have to be careful, it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that will judge the best,” he says.
The Race to Festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nonetheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskars has begun.
All West Coast festivals, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, give them value, and make sure the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness made a good impression at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a rally at the end of the year on the stock market? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December on the stock market usually performs positively.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, especially since, in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favour of the stock market catching up in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect fleeing towards quality values in both long and short tranches".
For this reason, they believe that the stock market will be more lateral, not free of volatility “especially because the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions.”
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
“It’s not the thing for many joys,” the expert says.
The Ibex has lost nearly 4% from the peaks set on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Still, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, said: “We are close to technical levels and therefore we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on news coming from the U.S. regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market.”
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be responsible for bringing the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that “this year it’s up to big values.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, says that the increases will come from the banking and industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case of eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual eventual
“ACS has been regaining positions for several months and we expect other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow the same path,” explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a bearish month.
The real end-of-year rally was held in 2003, when the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 rebounded by 28.17%, December posted a rebound of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and if it can count on its rally at the end of the year.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate much of its offices.
In total 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be decisive for other entities to adhere or not to this initiative that follows the opening hours of the stores.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, freelancers and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open all over Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling of the already existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the space of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, says that this restructuring does not imply a large investment, although a greater recruitment of staff, since it moves from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have space for SMEs to gather there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, explains <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of Madrid’s Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran Vía streets have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 operating under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very long hours, which are even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises PopularMax will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles its rival's stock exchange value for the first time Antena 3
We've made it.'
With that phrase yesterday, Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain that runs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: “It’s what hurts me, not because we’ve grown more, but because we’ve come down less,” he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, “we’ve fallen less.”
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That profit puts its loss at what we have been doing in the year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antenna 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulates a 40.5% decline since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (editor of Five Days) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we profit from it in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first TV channel this year to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this announced data becomes true, the television network would record this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising revenue compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, net turnover for Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (to reach 734.4 million) while net TV revenue grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría shared 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in partnership with its parent company Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, whom we have already valued with 33% of Endemol’.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and by 7% in 2009.
It is explained that the projected revenue growth has been reduced from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3’s earnings forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel to its parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial advisory services to specialized firms as well as to natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (FIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and holding companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with existing exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment firms to disclose information on the market on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they perform, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Economics Commission, several modifications were incorporated, including that securitized debts are considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high danger to the investor, which has been proven with what happened with the U.S. high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that can be carried out by graduates in Economics and Business 30 years after the passing of the Royal Decree in 1977 delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work for another person, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its products marketing and customer acquisition services to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The forward indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modeling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the forward indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Vice-President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the 4.1% increase in CPI in November was a "temporary figure", but at the same time he said the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not count on such a high rise.
“We expected a figure of around 4%,” the economy minister acknowledged regarding the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise $42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time he was hoarding a record deposits above 25 billion pounds, a figure that has progressively fallen in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money that the government offered and that will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the company with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to raise about a quarter of the revenues from British banks deposited over the next three years to achieve that remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, involving three other companies, as its favorite to rescue it from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then governor of the municipality, and that according to sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Officers continue to register the municipal units and the council of Urbanism and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore aforado, was arrested leaving the home of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are being detained.
Bono agrees to lead PSOE’s candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to top the list of the PSOE for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE Organization Secretary, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting held this noon in the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if the socialists win in the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of Congress, who made public last November 15 his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to devote himself to fighting climate change in the university sphere.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he succeeds, Bono hopes to turn the House into “the house of respect and not of insult or scream” and “make it more and more resemble the citizens.”
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only local in Madrid where you can not talk quietly and quietly is the Congress, the president of the Government on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
Likewise, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, he pointed out, his adversaries could see as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
Given that the climate change movement subjects both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles to harmless persecution, it is bound to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach forces him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the breach, in which sectors it has occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it demands that he explain with the utmost clarity to the Spaniards what measures he will take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected, what citizen habits will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to make, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there have not been and will not be any such explanations.
It’s because it’s about sacrifice and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individuals accounts.
Even the cent of the gas suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he hastily denied it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothingness, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of every real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new offices.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a merely virtual contracting party and does not mean that we travel by bike or cool off with the fan.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a hotel businessman for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation reported today.
The mayor was arrested in his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose offices he is currently together with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Department of Urbanism and the municipal company of management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which is instructed by Totana Court No. 1.
The first six detainees have gone to court today.
According to sources, the former governor of Totana and now autonomous parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former wife, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former governor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of Grupo Nuaria, the Vigo lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Soil of Inmonuar, an agency integrated in the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes were carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Civil Guard’s Central Operational Unit (UCO) Group of Urban Crimes, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the car parks in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Advocates, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way at the head of the PISA report on education level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn’s book appeared there:
"The content of the Philosophy signature has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Counselor in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague passes information on the introduction of Internet download offences into the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a criminal offence with a penalty of six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs worth less than 400 euros from the store, it is simply considered to be missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal from the store up to 1,000 euros, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty remains lower than the penalty imposed on unloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of unloading (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous quarrel is punishable by a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would be punishable by a penalty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. Distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's hand is going away, a very long hand.

My GP gives me one of his rare research articles titled, ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less.’
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depends on what the peers earn.
The study has been conducted using MRI scans at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging Group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if they both got the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received twice as much, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if so much science required this conclusion.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the massacre of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are in that list from which takes its title the documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, not premiered in Spain) that, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the escaped criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance does it suit me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver against possible claims, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which states that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being held liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the insurance price, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is given to it, among others.
The insurance companies set their prices based on the statistics, so that the more likely you are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
That is why both women over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower rate of injury due to their prudence.
Also, by taking advantage of the counts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the likelihood of having some kind of mishap.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will explain the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that the latter, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various disadvantages when it comes to taking out insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well insured is full-risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
More cautious drivers can opt for a full-risk franchise, so they get full-risk insurance coverage but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would require the client to pay a portion of the amount of the claim.
"The portion of the amount of the claim contributed by the customer will be pre-established based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, chief executive officer in Spain at First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the customer insures protection against damage caused to third parties, but not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid the claims as much as possible, as this will impact on the bonus, and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses," Noguera explains.
After the age of 25, it is easier for drivers to take out insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is most advisable to hire an all-risk franchise.
"Normally young people cannot make use of the experience previously gained when dealing with an accident, and even at the time of driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children it is preferable that they negotiate insurance at full risk, as long as their economic situation allows it, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest incident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at full risk with a deductible (this can be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They drive more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchise,” said Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is advisable to have a full-risk insurance with a franchise (which is 150 euros), or an extended one to third parties when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver against possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
Celtic seeks a point worth the eighths in Milan
Milan and Celtic will meet on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the league of the 'Champions', as the Italians serves to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians scored ten points and already certified their pass with a draw in Portugal on the fifth day, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that Shakhtar, with six, and that he receives Benfica, which has four, not ahead of him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the entire sixth day, as Milan has to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where they debut on the 13th in semifinals in search of a place for the 16th final.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw at Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go for a win, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would be first and ensure a better crossing in octaves.
Gordon Strachan's ensemble could even serve a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but it can't be trusted because the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the milanists will try to bitter the night to the Scots, who rely on getting in eighths for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a goal of Kaka in the overtime (1-0) after the 0-0 of the one-way.
Waiting for the rossoneri’s victory will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the win, in case he loses Celtic, both to get into the octaves and to remain in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being the last and with no choice to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have begun in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out tickets to witness the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that made furor in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects his main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five Spice Girls came out on stage wearing bracelets from Posh Spice’s husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowded audience at GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had banned him days before.
In the run-up to the show’s start, Victoria Beckham said the British star “hasn’t seen our wardrobe at all, so I’m nervous about what she’s going to think of the show.”
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the show began.
“I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I’m glad I made the decision,” Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “things have been fixed and we love each other very much.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies awaited them.
Among the five, there are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will be playing in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia’s export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine was to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge Ukraine more, as it has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be Ukraine paying 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about transit rates levels [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian nations.
NHS 'must test foreign workers'
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal record records of employees from outside Europe, a vigilante said.
Auditor General Robert Black’s recommendation came after it was found that a foreign doctor was linked to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of how much foreign staff it has.
However, her report pointed to other checks that are being carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European Economic Area in the wake of the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep crashed into the doors of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in the UK.
NHS expects to conduct pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses “Disclosure Scotland” to conduct criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside of Britain.
“Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: “our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff.”
BMA Scotland President Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment checkups work at NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor cautioned that the number may be higher, partly because boards have trouble identifying employees with indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely followed.
This includes passport checks, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the pre-employment policy and guidance of foreigners at the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I had a great interest in this work being carried out in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups - including foreigners - what they planned to release next month.
Joy Division dominates at film awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division’s late vocalist, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the Best Picture Award.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond protagonist Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until her suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film featuring soundtracks from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order was produced for just <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
But Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards – Best Director and Best Debut Director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning at the ceremony – such as Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, which won the award for Best Documentary.
The Best Actor award was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in the David Cronenberg film Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently film the sequel to Indiana Jones' "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named after Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
"I was fortunate to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, he’s really an honor.”
The Independent Film Awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and sponsors of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning the smuggling of missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have campaigned against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the TV report said.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 to protect the Abqaiq facility, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned the smuggling of eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active to stop Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining as militants in al-Qaeda to fight Allied forces and back the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heresy by the more extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants — recruited by calls from Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden to harass the country’s pro-Western government — targeted government-associated foreign residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, from five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
The arrested also include a 16-person “media cell” in Medina, whose objective was to promote “takfiri thought” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims deemed infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus's climate may give you an idea of Earth's future
Venus may once have been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a twin Earth than previously observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion from solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provides an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: “It is becoming clearer why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
“Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus started as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police confiscate "enriched uranium"
One kilogram of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
It still remains open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and send them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey that asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican Party debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party ahead of next year’s elections.
It is not known exactly how the CNN producers, who co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to showcase candidates for candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to raise the dial when they heard ideas they liked: Issuers noticed peaks of approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The night’s toughest exchanges of words took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a leader in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation as he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidates could support an “amnesty” (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the chance to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
None have the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, coupled with fear of China’s toxic toys and other concerns overseas, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other topics came up.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether diving in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble toward the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now, against all expectations, first in the latest Iowa poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is rising in Iowa, coincidentally with liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns, and his heated statements from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate united the early party and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the game is divided and the result is far from clear.
Dolores Laborista
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink in; but it still emerges.
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
No influences appear to have been sold, no exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, no extramarital finger sucking.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour government party, worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million), for nearly four years using fake names, and that the party has not denounced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister eluded calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by stating that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing wit, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The bailout of a troubled bank, Northern Rock, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative chaos.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably walking towards the exit.
Governments may reach a turning point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it’s clear that the prime minister can’t make things better, that he doesn’t have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials start to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is defensive and not focused.
On one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
The Northern Rock issues and the authority registration tax, are related to Brown’s decisions as the treasury’s chancellor.
And even when it’s not directly involved in Blairish’s setbacks — or “partner cash,” research into political party funding — voters can assume it is.
However, Mr. Brown’s situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been directly scammed.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The anti-anonymity laws for big political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's deal, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraiser's head who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but he is diluted in decision-making on a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter – led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Public Life Standards Commission, since he has not had one in six months, and he must also push for genuine party finance reform.
This will require an arduous cooperative work by Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions -- bitter measures for a partisan like Mr. Brown.
But he has to deal with some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable honesty and strong competition.
Sharks Cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there’s blood in the water, it’s natural for thrilled dorsal fins to swim around.
Now that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million charges in its U.S. consumer finance business, in part due to weak card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delinquency and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, the third quarter’s 3.89% crime rate was nearly a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American People’s Bankruptcy Act (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a huge loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of delinquency) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection channels of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at cash flow than active securities, so falling prices don’t necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ creditworthiness.
They can even work to outperform the issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decline if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card’s debt rises on the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to difficult conditions than mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering creditor balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid asset rebalancing.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief finance officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a contraction of credit pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
We have to keep watching those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for fraud with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of fraudulent collusion.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC at the Royal Bank, became a famous cause in Britain for the extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were for having warned Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The accusation against the bankers -- doubled the "NatWest Three" -- alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of Enron frauds, which helped its spiral of collapse in bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interests at zero, but the three British knew it would value upwards.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in interest in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers collected $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was taking place.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, couldn’t hide the debt of millions or make his failing businesses look successful.
The collapse caused thousands of jobs to be lost, more than 60 million in market securities and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were charged over the past few years for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
“It can accommodate up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
“But none asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for family private flights or for presidents of a company.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury vendors had installed their display stands, hoping to attract wealthy new Russians to all kinds of products, from crafted mahogany yachts to diamond-encrusted car grilles worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche at the booth next to his."
“It’s a beautiful car, but it’s nickel and cauldron compared to us,” he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fuel-supplied by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to gather in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis of the 70s and the Japanese of the 90s, the Russians are emerging as the biggest consumers and spenders in the world.”
The world’s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the rich second-degree include 103,000 Russian billionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of personal wealth developments in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time alongside the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in an afternoon suit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit he wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum pen cutters, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who was sitting patriotically at a stand of Dutch Royal Delft porcelain, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, salespeople said the wealthiest Russians (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from eye-catching logos to limited-edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people – cash millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists – fill the halls every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, managing director of the King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress sets each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grilles, for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded with Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,” says Mr. Karapetian.
“He’s going to keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars.”
Even if many of his Russian customers are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian billionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if you’re not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone booths (British style) filled with stacks of counterfeit $1 million bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire’s Fair.
Visitors stopped by shaking piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobiles while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev says.
"Chap" Surgery Could Be Cause of Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the “A little healthier” restaurant and saw an ambulance climb up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance come in," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant's supervisor, that day Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Investigators are now trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue house.
Authorities still don't know what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but they're waiting for the toxicology test even though the results won't be available for a few weeks, helping to resolve the mysterious death that grieved the top ranks of Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” McCarthy said of Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that he left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for the County Union prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead at the scene.
It has been more than a week and authorities have said little about his investigation or about the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door at Mrs. Castro’s home, where a withered rosewood is located at the front of the house, and a Dalmatian bark at the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainillina ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this one or that one,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
Federal Reserve Is Expected to Cut Rates to Raise the Stock Exchange
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were ramped up with tranquilizing comments from the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
The stock exchanges loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that policymakers should be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to the continued tensions in financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turmoil was “partly reversed by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October.”
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that hit the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in an overall cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at close to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at close to 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of Britain’s top-tier companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Previously, the recurrence of credit tension in the markets was highlighted after strong demand in a three-month auction of funds by the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained credit and rates of three-month "Libor" loans among British banks, meant the biggest increase since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England takes the lawsuits of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the team that is on loan - with that particular title at least - is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, England's director, is starting to fill up with offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part time.
Those who don’t get the sixth place bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than for ability.
Not only in cricket is choice difficult, as judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, had been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level is for a cricket player, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so too do they have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to grab the captain's eye while taking a wicket and a batter to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the coaches is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who plays surely in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for "fit and bowls" as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of these.
The Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium may only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every race and did well in the first few, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a player of importance, and despite scoring a double-hundred against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion in today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah’s favor is his brilliant and valuable early-88 debut test in Bombay, 32-hundred first-class versus only 6 of Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent background against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two turns in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, he seemed to have taken from his batting some momentum than in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has joy of living on swords.
He got caught up in nothing on the cricket field and his attitude was summarized as when he dumped his vehicle at an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at the distance, to tell him excitedly, “Did you see that?”
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he hits with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work - and Fight Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles who ran out of cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that it’s safe now.”
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to temporarily cease.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped drive al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been driven from their home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to stand up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my and my comrades’ support.”
“That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were drawn to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops secured groups of “concerned citizens,” armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many claimed to have returned for visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, called on the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees’ visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death rows.
“We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them back to Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and start the struggle.
The little Saar, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines for the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, Sardinians lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftyth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French" - that was the ironic bike about themselves from the smallest federal state for his fiftieth birthday.
At the same time France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system which in a study by the Institute of German Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" ranked fifth.
In this way, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, from 15.6 per hundred.
However, the number of students from the Saar is above average in higher schools, many of whom do not have a bacillerate.
"In the Saarland the vocational education system is taken advantage of," says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than one in five young people completes their high school at the Vocational School, so it turns out that Saarland is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of engineering science graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced higher schools to advertise more for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in general education schools,” said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative evidence across the country.
In order for the children to start studying the final year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", this is at no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show if the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of backward students in school development declined from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But overall, the Saar did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the displeasure of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chavez changed the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets change the time in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Currently Chávez is staying as a comic in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will be less than four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would impose the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the rupture of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship either with the head of state or with the Colombian government until conservative Alvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
“My dignity does not allow me to do it,” says Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, their power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which it was about the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said criticizing that Uribe’s decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chávez in Spain.
A new ringtone makes a sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?", is the phrase that half a million people have already downloaded.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was upset by the continued interruptions by the leftist populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decline in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to calculations by the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real wage account in 2007 than the previous year.
"The fault for that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the strain of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research in Economic Cycles told Bild newspaper.
New unemployment insurance charges may also apply to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from one year to the next is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the labor office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for loans and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician from the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday, it was made public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food and petroleum derivatives sector reached its highest level for 13 years.
Compared to last year, prices are rising by 3%.
Venus: Earth's twin brother.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that hasn't been raised so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
Three decades ago, researchers suspected that there could be rays on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays call from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, tells Cris Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to Urey-Miller’s famous model of the origin of life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms may have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, gave rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it’s not like that: if there were life there someday, that would have to be in one of the earliest states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface temperatures of 500°C reign, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
"Possibly, Venus is a 'diabolic' twin of Earth, but it's still a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest research findings to be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to the researchers, underscore not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with Earth than we had assumed," ESA reports.
Despite the well-known stormy winds at the North Pole, researchers also discovered in the southern polar region a swirling cloud vortex.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of Giuseppe Piccioni researchers from the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet also called Dawn Star or Evening Star orbits the Sun for almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bar does not resemble Earth much, scientists assume that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
The two planets had agglomerated water that remained on Earth in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties over the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Foreign Ministry.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the September rally.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany’s reputation and therefore demanded that the grand coalition end that fight over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the "Handelsblatt" newspaper.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
“Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy metering, the Federal President stresses, defending Merkel for the reproach she received in carrying out a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not take the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Foreign Ministry caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the German Finance Minister, but also, according to information sources in the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded that Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians to receive the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama demonstrated that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that riots like those in France will occur.
Battles with police in the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will take place as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
Barricades were made, vandals shot the police with rifles: after serious riots starring young people in France, Federal Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We must also ensure that our country’s social problems do not take the violent form.”
"That we have to take seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all young people are involved in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits.”
It is still early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same edifying and sociological problems as they do in France.
The youngsters starred in serious street riots with police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolouse.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany, demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of all, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above the average.
There must be more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: "We need to give young people a perspective."
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is a great social control in the families", greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, “But in spite of everything, we have to be careful.”
It is necessary to "give young people the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training sooner".
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel went peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses flew over the territory.
Responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and cars burned.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that police will take strict action until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, about 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot began in a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the deaths of the young people were not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more is to be expected from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate, indifferent performance and without much content in the general debate in the lower house, it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach she was given for having repeatedly devoted herself to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the lower house, it was made very clear to all that this reproach was appropriate.
You couldn’t feel any interest or any feeling about the country’s problems.
But instead, <0xC3><0x81>ngela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away in foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything concrete.
An example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself greatly for the decisions made at Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself – for the past two years the head of the Party of the Christian Democratic Union has not been able to afford such modesty.
Well, he endeavors in expressions to get an impulse to the people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without leaving the branches.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke the inner problems are appearances of little value.
The poverty of children and concerns for low-wage workers?
The only thing he devotes is to talk about this subject using subordinate sentences.
It’s amazing how often you get it wrong when it comes to the supplement for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble “as if it were in an unknown territory,” when it comes to more specific information.
The Attacks section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a standoff in a heated debate over YouTube’s Republican presidential pre-candidates and must now fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between the candidates are already evident from the outset.
Mitt Romney blamed his adversary Rudy Giuliani for making New York “a refuge for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani replied: "I would like to say that his own home was a 'port' for the illegals." Giuliani responded to the former Massachusetts governor by saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans has no clear favorite, the eight pre-presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were uploaded to Youtube, also do not have much content.
“With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” was John McCain’s rebuke of his adversary Ron Paul, the only one of the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from veterans of the war in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown his death.
Reactions from the public in the room in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that meanwhile the campaign’s most important topics are other, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied raising taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At that time I was wrong," Romney explains, grieving, and apologises to the people and television audience for being an abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf ruled without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is how the eight years of military rule in Pakistan ended.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his term as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he came to power with a blatant military coup, the former general ruled the state for the first time as a civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the oath Musharraf will very soon annul the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the West.
Musharraf’s lawyers have been in a state of emergency since the Supreme Court proclaimed it, and last week the Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new election of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continues its activity: three members of "Harmony" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release, a copy of "Live 1974" was made that was written at the band's best time.
In those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has before them their box, their cables and above all their buttons.
In the middle sits 63-year-old Dieter Moebius in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking out of the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the band Harmonia made music again.
What we have to rebel about here is this: the accurate questions have shown that the name of the band rumbled in the minds of people, but it was not something so special that after 32 years the audience missed it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the seventies?
Especially because the Krautrock misconception was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a music award "Echo" to members of Cologne's Can 2003 band for their life work, in the room you could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths with amazement.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio existed only two years and in those times did not achieve a great effect in the audience, however, it got it later thanks to the others.
A while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Later, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was rather an artist’s life full of surprises.
One day, they say, a Harmonia singing association banner from Ottenstein appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second was called "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording, almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up getting involved in esoteric issues and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and since then has been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set itself the goal of cultivating this own German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius’s work, the band Neu! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the following pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno’s quote, accompanied by special music, fills the room: “This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are photos where Harmonia with producers appears on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the black and white photo projections, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but attach the microphones to the organ and the drums so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Nowadays, electronic music is what it had to be.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical setting he coughs, whispers and at a good time of emphasis sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever screams here "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
On the stage he reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music begin and end?
That can break one’s nerves or give away a few quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to the war in the Balkans.
But the two had not much conviction.
Either the concepts focus a lot on actions and shootings or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help either in this case.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasurable and insignificant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is perhaps the most important plot to watch the movie "The Hunting Party - When a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and silly today?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the eye: in the background, his role as a reporter in war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could have done, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have already passed, who as a monument to the ruin of his decadence retained so far most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the Balkan war.
You can narrate the film "Moerderischer Frieden" in a nutshell: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very fast and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost to actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not once again presented as the sole culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a situation of war.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard on two charges), the story about American reporters in the war going to spot a war criminal Serb called “fox,” could probably be a new “Apocalypse Now.”
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to do something the army can’t do and each time it turns out to be a crazy journey.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at the beginning we are introduced to Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also envisions a love affair with a Muslim Bosnian woman who they are going to kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with impressive speed accomplish what NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters in the world could not achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave them to the Bosnian Muslims to avenge themselves fairly.
It is so bad, that they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against kinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is actually a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and stresses that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about persecuting them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not only the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or into minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Across All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bloody Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It has to be at least decades before Hollywood makes a good movie about the Holocaust with the film Schindler's List as an example.
Classics such as the Vietnam War Works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their days were not unanimously celebrated as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because script writers don’t have the slightest resentment (which is necessary to be able to) in telling good stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Great Dictator” turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn’t know how bad the Nazi regime was actually.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look at an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change."
The big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly murdered and in Yugoslavia war will always reign.
Von Beust received negative criticism of the Olympics.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and the economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, managing director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday this resignation was "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
“Without this goal, we could not maintain the political, sporting momentum at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg’s ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least the year 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but it is decided by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," von Beust says in WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) which is expected in early December, on Munich’s application for the Winter Olympics of 2028.
“This preference means to us that in this period of time, which we previously thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view, we will have no opportunity.”
Despite everything, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sport Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut’s statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics.
"It's too soon to let go of the opportunity, if at this point the plans are ruined," HSB director Günter Ploß said Wednesday.
A waiver of the application contradicts the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Federation of Sport of Higher Schools (ADH).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's 2015 application for universities not as a "substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sport Federation of Higher Schools named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) blamed the Senate for not taking advantage of such valuable time for building houses in Hamburg.
“For many years the Senate was delaying the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses,” said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for the little Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU underscored the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg’s application for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who links the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Today the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Brightness-Boxes on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Bright-Boxes, the Moderna Museum in Stockholm conducted internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Bright-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén museum gave to the other ones in the Moderna Museum.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Bright-Boxes" in New York, painted the wooden boxes in red, blue and white, with the same sample that had "Bright" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his works from 1968 at the Modern Museum were exposed hundreds of Bright cardboard boxes. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Bright" cardboard factory.
They were not works of art, but specimens (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden some Bright wooden boxes, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museet.
Witnesses of that time now speak of nearly fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Bright-Boxes" of the "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden almost one hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him were produced and exposed.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservators of the Modern Museum, investigated six Bright Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of 1990 shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the tightened silvers. Besides it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol’s Bright Boxes,” says Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern Museum and adds that if the Authentication Commission “Andy Warhol Art” in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify these six boxes as the copies/objects of the exhibition.
As early as July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious allegations" that they are boxes of soap dust.
But from that moment on everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for bloodshed.
Government-faithful soldiers had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been entrenched in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had trial on Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, in order to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Evidently, the military police officers who were to watch him had passed into his ranks and followed his mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Hotel Noble.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
“People are fed up,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to come into our ranks.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously headed the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that soon the other military troops wanted to continue the march.
Big government critics called Thursday for a big rally against the president.
For months, his government has been accused of corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be Versatel’s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for a share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company’s uptake.
There are also options to further increase the financial share at Versatel.
United Internet said it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday, the assumptions were already made about entering the business, after the bank Brendenberg increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, that means that the financial institution keeps the equity securities for a third-party partner.
United Internet already the day before involved with almost 10 percent of the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital increase measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares with a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares of them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on marketing cooperation for DSL-products.
“We are strengthening our collaboration,” the United Internet spokesman said.
The two companies founded a company together MSP, to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not use its right, that is, they participate to 18.49 per hundreds of Freenet.
That meant that both companies retained all the options, especially the shareholding in the Freenet public limited company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch is going to make the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
