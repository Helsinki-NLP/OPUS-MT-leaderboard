Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the doors to the release of the former minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic offences in second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia disadvantageous to Ukraine over the purchase of natural gas.
The ruling is not yet final and the appeals court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365 of the Penal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
The victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to be determined who is the winner.
As is already customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is about clarifying whether they are moderate or radical
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in some ways.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves’ hands will be cut off.
Women may already forget to emancipate and apostates awaiting their execution and so on.
Instead of by the person of the dictator, society, composed of warring tribes, will be united by the Qur’an.
In Libya an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably not suited, on the other hand, to the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it does not cease to surprise that the Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of the unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, the NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When victors are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we did not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will oil companies be able to get Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible not, but it may be that finally the West can boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of the Sharia do not cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are on the hunt for investors
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the quarter-to-quarter period, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors no longer focus only on Italy, but also on Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data for the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the forecast 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the quarter-to-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and, according to the <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A>, the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic development growth is conformed.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main Events:
The Czech economy grew year-on-year in the third quarter of this year by 1.5%, but has stagnated quarterly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen year-on-year by 5.2%.
The interest on its ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest in Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on Czech 10-year bonds remains at 4%, although the situation in the area is getting worse.
In Germany there are voices saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the European Cup.
They won 1:0 and celebrated the qualifying with a premium of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended themselves fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so it will not miss the appointment of the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in detail in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also the excellent game of <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the heroic Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not push until the second half.
The two injured in the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who missed two major occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup appointment, so the chests of national football will reach an approximate gratification of 200 million crowns.
Already from the first few minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams were just trying to keep the lines and played just around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicking the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred college students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying Tuesday at noon in front of the facility and then chanted death slogans to the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan around the nuclear technology center where uranium is being worked.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is striving to obtain nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon at the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then threw death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, Israeli sources say not only the Isfahan plant, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than one-third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with overweight, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It is again demonstrated the importance of the environment where it is grown for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference.
At the table, obsessed children feed, for example, on sausages at least twice as often as children from normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had chips the day before the analysis, which is linked to the “Obesity is not a coincidence” prevention program.
In families of overweight children there is no habit of playing sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved nearly 900 basic education children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program of "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th grade.
A proper diet and enough exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly decrease the number of overweight and even obese children.
“Only half of the children surveyed have answered that they have five meals a day according to the regimen: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” one of the survey results said.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, the details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed time for breakfast with the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households they don’t have breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, insane chips are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet soft drinks on a daily basis (70%).
As a rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sport, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make Your Diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
“The dietary preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal.”
Among your favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
“It is above all alarming the popularity of sweet sodas,” the study’s final report warns.
As the main meal, take the palm pasta and follow closely the bird meat.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
“In the control group of study participants, who completed the questionnaire after completing the prevention program ‘Obesity is not a coincidence’, there was in many cases a significant change in favor of the principles of healthy eating,” the study’s findings point out.
Attention is drawn, for example, to sweet sodas, where many children would begin to prefer normal running water.
Children would also more often choose poultry meat and fish for the main meal in the questionnaire and would restrict consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals of the industry, how to dress problem characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of entertainment.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is cuellicort, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone suffers from overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften a wide shoulder, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given some tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress it too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth sewing at least one extra piece of tailor-made fabric.
They will certainly not regret it, because the clothes that feel perfectly are priceless.
With a bespoke skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing on the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapery.
There are certainly many different kinds of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have all the week to put order in my head all this information.
And even so, I am afraid that with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom he must design two costumes: one for the day and one for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
It was up to me to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
The dresses have to be cut from the magazines or search for them on the internet and print them, then graphically elaborate them.
The moodboard, which is called the full result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist, therefore, does not only physically dress, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (on specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník spoke to us about all this.
But all this is left for Sunday.
The designer must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests cheered up Saturday’s conference with information about all types of bodies.
Fashion designer Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardina (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed classically with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just roll it up and up the neck to get a totally different image.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
“Then you can break them,” Jakub said.
It finally becomes clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (thus ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this has to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that image and style alone are, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (my abilities are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate us a size very different from their actual (smaller).
Then it is only left to gougle and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written about the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained weight/weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion, but he has to understand outfit.
During your work, above all, you should communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn’t miss them, he defends their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can't take and throw away everything that was there and say, 'Wow, what a horror.'"
“Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend for someone to put on,” Mario says.
He also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
They are objects such as scissors, scissors, clippers, or must-have. There are also nylon yarn (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as handbags or hats), special clips of hook of garments in front, if it was larger (pins and other type of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a set of
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the sole of shoes.
Even during photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole and much more the exterior could be damaged.
And we did nothing but clothe and clothe.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skillful.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I don’t really have those skills.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I’ve already realized that devoting myself to styling at a professional level is not a pink road, but I don’t care exactly what people say.
Need for Speed: The Run is an all-American game.
Reviewed
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of inappropriate neglects of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To some extent it was possible to meet expectations, but this is of no use if, in reality, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new installment, to which The Run is added, aroused high expectations even before its release.
He promised that he would give new air to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, in the wake of what was shown, appears as a game that should not end up being an action genre once again.
We also felt curious to know how the scenes would look inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total computation points are lost because of absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In reality, they cannot even be called errors, but rather it is the incomprehensible misconception of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race all over America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place by a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely feel that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graphic is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing from the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that diminishes visibility.
But in the mountains you must be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then try to win time (timed classic duel) and then a duel against a single opponent awaits you.
In the middle of all this sometimes appears the police, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you would expect (in particular there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can already search elsewhere.
But a race conceived with a lot of action suits quite this driving style, although we will be able to find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, all in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer true for collisions.
From games of this type it is not expected to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, with which everything is not in order.
It is typical that, when making a very tight overtaking or circulating the car with normal traffic, there are only slight rubbing, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or it even ends up totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no big problems, but it can get you in a bad mood.
Resets are programmed in such a way that when you crash or leave the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five resets are available.
If you consume all of them, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something goes wrong, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, even reset does not help, it only helps to learn the given stage from memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you will find somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrived five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see that two cars that meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It’s the same when you arrive, because it’s programmed because the “surprise” will always happen in front of your noses.
The opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always be ahead of you in the same place.
This also happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come from the front, so at first you can rub the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it’s a shame, because even if the travel model is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or qualifying in the race so that boredom doesn’t fit, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during races.
You have to be aware of the gasoline supplies next to the road, because precisely there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example on curved mountain roads.
In addition to the main narrative thread, there is also a parallel thread of challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know through the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and finishing with funds for the profile.
At the same time, there is an online Autolog feature, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community features.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the tunnel of the metro (pass), where you run in the dark through the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km / h (pass) and suddenly, from behind you the metro convoy arrives and takes you ahead without further ado.
In the editorial we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game none even thought a little or if the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual effects are in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
What a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This affects especially accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for their music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It feels like the game is not over.
The fun is assured, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of airport reflectors.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
“I didn’t expect a war without a barracks to be set up.”
"It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," began her lecture at the Law School with conviction the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How not to take seriously his slogan "clear and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers at the Law School of U. Carolina.
Vicenová also considered the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing is the criticism, that if he is insulous, a gray official, able to take on any role, but I must say that he left everyone bewildered, because he assumes his roles perfectly."
“He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.”
The new post of Foreign and Security Policy representative is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union with regard to states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda followed, continues and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good riot", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget has to be approved, caused by the current much more complicated economic situation.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will take priority, which countries will receive the most support and which countries will receive the least, which will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly".
“The truth is, I don’t like ugly abbreviations, foreigners, or jargons that people don’t understand.”
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes, or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to take greater advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative rather than the positive.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is on a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the poor support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approach me, a Frenchman next to me says, 'What, you've already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?'
In the future, according to Vicenová, the EU is awaiting very tough new budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe than the new "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure.”
“It was said for the first time that only those countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, stay out.”
“These procedures will increasingly strengthen the two-speed Europe,” Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of Czechia and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the entire EU should be discussed among member states, not only among members of the Eurozone.
- Brand story:
Innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were to look for a term that very accurately defined IBM’s strategy, the most approximate would be “long term.”
To the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet has already passed a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation of this long-term character was laid by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his stamp, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully raised company culture.
“For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous move towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around.
That has enabled us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We look forward to further prosperity in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company.
A sophisticated system
As early as the 1930s, Watson cared for his employees as the employer of Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a in Czechia (IBM employees were among the first American operators to enjoy paid vacation, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in its relationship with the customer.
Already from the beginning the company knew how to discover talent (being one of the first global companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM’s current plan, which will replace Palmisano next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
In recent years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which arise infinite future strategies and innovations.
It’s no surprise that there are more than half a million people working in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM has maintained a concept of an institution rather than a technology company,” says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or "Great Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become over the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructures and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the largest number of patents of all U.S. tech companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are ATMs, payment cards, financial exchanges, barcodes and floppy disks.
This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on advancing, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past,” Palmisano said.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on other platforms (and also, if they don’t work, abandons them).
And that’s the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one-fifth are programs and one-fifth are equipment.
However, even in 1990, teams accounted for more than half of the share of suppliers.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for a total value of $15 billion, and over the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have followed since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM operates on the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of the year 29 increased investments.
It seems that until now IBM has managed to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratosphericly to 120%, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
We can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From the Cheese Cutter to Spaceflight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York one hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 – it was originally a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave rise to the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
It owned inventions such as the famous "signer clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over its supervisory board.
Flint signed the head of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The new leader overshadowed IBM’s founder (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are built).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson ran the company, turnover doubled by $9 million and the company’s great expansion began across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly forty years in the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM personnel and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the computer standard of that time, came on the market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer comprehensive advice and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, “a smarter planet.”
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not improved, for example, with regard to transport and city administration.
For the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 it opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) became the sole protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but no longer like my partner," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová explained.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová welcomed Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ové into her house during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the petition, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>any and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even declared publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
If one day Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him away.”
"But here I would live no longer as my beloved old bugger who was wrong, but as a man with whom I have certain bonds," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová said, adding that he had already detached himself from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
So far, Josef does not care that his wife has closed her back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible."
“My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
"The company is still in place, I make the home arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I talked normally, the only thing is that we don't share bed," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová found a new love, he would not oppose it.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” Josef concluded.
Women’s worst vices: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some of the typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that manage to boil the blood of men?
Going shopping
Do you blame your half-orange for being dependent on shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one dish a week?
Do you like to shop often at sales?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to stroll around the clothing stores, look for tight-fitting garments and then test them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can practically become a hell.
Just remember how many times you have already told your partner to wait for you in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I'd need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
“Do you really like me?”
Don't you hear these phrases?
What do you mean?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her look.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite tiovive.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, dust off, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children who have dirty a freshly cleaned washbasin and a shelf with glass doors that you had so hard to clean?
In case you suffer from this “deviation,” try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"The used panties are left with the dirty laundry."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too."
"The wet cloth is not left on the floor!"
If you do these cometaries to your partner more times a day, know that this will get you out of your boxes.
Of course, you don't want to say anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, wouldn’t make as many comments.
slander and gossip
Some women also get slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, which is why they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe every one of us sometimes misses a little harmless gossip.
With your hand on your heart, this is true of almost every woman.
On the other hand, there are gossip women of those who are not controlled, who love to gossip and often do so, they despise everyone and they are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female workforce.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jágr participated in the NHL match on Monday with two assists that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and put the Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the play of the 39-year-old star, and took a step further and was declared best player of the game.
Two assists were awarded in the match and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the meeting, Jágr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
“Before the match, I told him I would triple.”
"I presented it."
"Sometimes they seem like ambushes," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first hit.
A little later also the second intervention of the team had a Czech trail.
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek took the disc behind the Hurricanes' goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was kicked out, but from the beginning of the second half already dominated the Flyers.
Especially by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr, he scored the third goal, after his shot snatched through Wayne Simmonds' goal room.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say that he's the best player on the court, but he's definitely among the top three," Jágr said.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I was going to play with a athlete like him."
"I'm very pleased with that."
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my teammates were playing for me, and that now produces results,” Jágr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then again Dwyer's, penalty, to get a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any further complications, although they ended up beaten in number two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the disc, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to tie him to the record and I'm happy because I got it," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech Montreal defender, Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an injury to the upper body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of defensive experience, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec did not know how to take one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and playing the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
“We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels.”
“In short, but it’s that you can’t do anything about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
“We had to simplify the game even more, take the record out of our field.”
“And so we left gaps,” one of the defenses, P. K. Subban, explained.
Goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed with thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were scored by five players who thus ended a series of losses that had already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five state-authorized travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time sold in most cases trips only to the socialist bloc, because travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, afterwards the Yugoslav regime leaned westwards and the travels of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (that is, also the Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies in those times also offered trips to the West, but one had to stand in line with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired.
The Czech way of travel has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that the currently favorite destination, Croatia, could not travel freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s, the visa waiver for travel to neighbouring states in Western Europe was imposed, leading to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovakia, for a long time, were not tired of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in parks in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was to take food with them (conserves, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was rising and with it also average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in demand for travel.
With increasing demand for travel agencies began, starting in 1997, to regularly prepare trips using charter flight connections, which caused travel prices to drop incredibly compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining passenger volume discounts.
By the late 1990s, Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost every developed country except the US, which further simplified our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists depart every year to distant and hot countries. This winter will already be flying directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. abolished visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they have spent more than 15,000 CZK per head on travel abroad, including on-site expenses.
The Ordinary General Assembly was convened to elect the president, who could end up again in impasse.
For almost five months Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to follow.
Without the same, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June not without first summoning his colleagues in order to find a strong person who knows how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the end of the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, a controversy broke out between the two association federations unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16, when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní d<0xC5><0xAF>m), located in the Prague neighbourhood of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or even delegates with full powers.
From that point onwards and due to this single point, a partial agreement was reached, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
Even the Executive Committee could no longer shed more light on the situation, which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round, the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy will win.
The Moravian Region is willing to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of the bicameral system," that is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Morava side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Surprisingly, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík also agrees with this, although the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to suit Pelta more.
"I would like to have the maximum vote in accordance with the statutes."
“So that no nonsense about representatives is invented as at the last General Assembly,” says Victoria Plzen’s owner, who runs for the first time as a candidate and directs his observations mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be appeased with today's match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will again be a protagonist, and so it will cooperate more at ease," says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
“It’s not about the conflict between Bohemian and Moravian, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
“This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.”
“Anyway, I hope common sense will prevail,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special aircraft, which had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which they say will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the country’s most powerful sports organization to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sport (<0xC4><0x8C>STV), which will try to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the lottery house Sazka.
Paclík will fight to win the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), neither would present himself as a candidate for such a relevant position.
“If there were a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and not running for election.”
"But to this day such a person has not been found," Paclík told the Czech News Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>TK).
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged election winner, which paves the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly would come.
In that role he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to a few people I could consider.”
"For me it was crazy to hear some people say that they don't even want to identify with Czech football right now."
“I would like to change that view,” he adds.
What allegedly upsets Paclík at the moment is Pelta’s relationship with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to see Pelta sitting in the presidential armchair.
"In case he wins, the current status will remain and nothing in football will change."
“With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will take even less advantage,” Paclik said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name Pelta was associated with a telephone wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta emerged unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
“And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us,” said Paclik, who also takes his previous statement with some caution that “I would sell Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president.”
In the event of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Of the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"It's very capable."
“I could imagine him, for example, as the head of the representation.”
"but not as an association manager."
"I also don't get my noses where I don't feel capable," added Paclik, who in September drew a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitrators' Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He makes use of his management capabilities of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated the victory in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations," Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta president Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>etínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of the lottery taxes.
“It’s one of the key issues that the new president should be devoted to.”
“If they raise taxes on gambling, as political parties announce, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to go,” he says.
Moreover, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in hypocritically giving up my Pilsen Club actions to someone else and then returning there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes that would end the election stalemate.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R had new statutes that would definitively serve to settle, in the future, the controversies regarding the electoral rules.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could be good for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
“People of all levels have been dealing with football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new President on Thursday.”
“They feel it’s time for someone to manage the association,” thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and the Association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections lies the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly the statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought.”
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta said.
Exactly the re-adaptation of the Civic Association’s most important document was used as a lure to win the delegates.
“If I’m elected president, I’ll take it as a personal challenge and I’m willing to respond in case this fails.”
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we can’t exist,” Pelta says.
Also, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
In the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave him a puppet with his head.
“He’s been in the world of football for more than a year, and he’s already achieved some successes.”
"Their attacks were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the top competitions.
The latter should be a football promotion showcase.
“I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose from the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“Immediately afterwards I would be involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football,” the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal changes to the squad.
"He would have to know the tasks of each employee first," he said, referring to Strahov, where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios foretold before the next general assembly, he believes delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburk on Thursday.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
“Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before the most decisive day in his representative career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working eagerly.
If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new President of the Czech Football Association at the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that if he were elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement systematic change and make the members of the executive committee accountable for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to resolving the Bohemian case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I would like to devote myself entirely to football.”
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, to professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
“With this I don’t mean that I would do it all alone,” Rajchl said in an interview for <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide the executive committee’s competencies in such a way that each member can devote themselves to a specific area.”
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
"A lot of people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that he has considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
“Everyone knows that I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me every step of the way," he said.
“A lot of people have told me I shouldn’t give up, because then the others would give up too.”
“It’s about having faith so you don’t give up like that, no more,” he said.
They say it also motivates him to continue the work he already started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work that I don’t want to miss now was done.”
"There are processes that had begun and that will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them," he said, worried that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be back as it was before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek's time.
“I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
“Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it was just a privilege for a few chosen.”
“I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not for the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
"I try to be objective."
“I want to make a football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another Morava, whose winners would go to the first division."
"It would not be the current situation where we have only three Moravian teams, which represents a problem for the young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Pilsner Club president Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík joined the presidential election, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
“I’m still sorry to have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me,” said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns from disadvantageous contracts, television contract negotiations and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his share of guilt in the fact that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is “disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football,” he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
“No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year.”
"In case he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
“I don’t want to use that in my favor,” Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Anyone who visits Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn’t miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Lie on her back on the water, staring at the artistic dome above, swimming towards the marble angels, waiting for her on the edge of the pool, and astonishing at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, taking note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "BadeFreuden": the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sport, Meder says, just water is different.
It only bothers you that bathing enthusiasts have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine smell, while running enthusiasts can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the cheerful bird trinos in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The spawning in the pool and the ethereal sauna oils. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are taken care of, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, indoor pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of floor, in the bathrooms you have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically folded: high vaults, colorful tiles, trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "BadeFreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting facts about architecture and the history of art in the historical oases of well-being, but, above all, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, there are waters with nitrates in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Term).
Many open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city looks at the roofed pool of Zurich, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberb from the outdoor swimming pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe practice on the ski slopes.
The perhaps most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: The Ötztal water cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steams up in winter, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary toilet.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legacy sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of wellness in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for nice places to bathe, when she wanted to visit uncovered swimming pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she encountered a blocked terrain.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weed grow among the tiles.
Decay rested in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can you discover neo-Roman elements from the time of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall in Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its meticulous modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of pool collector Iris Meder, and not only because it is native to the Black Forest.
“It has great merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” Meder says.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses commodity business
by Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural commodity business?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are withdrawing from the business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives prices up, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer advocacy campaign is aimed specifically at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in a similar way.
Originally, commodity betting was thought to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have disengaged from offers and demands, and make profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business “deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank’s good reputation.”
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank’s management, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “Betting on rising food prices particularly dramatically shows how ruthless banks are currently harming public welfare.”
Ackermann is found as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in bonds.
“Deutsche Bank must void all investments in its portfolio in which it puts the money at stake for food price betting,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the subject of hungry people or the fame of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before he leaves his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different than unplanned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agrarian speculation he can perfect his image.
And you need to care about possible losses, that's what your successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in commodities
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode released the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were bet.
Many of the bank’s clients showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would override all investments from which money comes out of agrarian speculation.
43 percent would discourage a bank like this to their acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The Relocated Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, left empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern post-gerra architecture is passionate, clear shapes, glass halls, brave curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The building is considered to this day a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian Pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was erected after the universal exhibition in the Schweizer Garten next to the southern station of Vienna, was renovated in 1962 and a 20th-century museum was inaugurated inside, called the "20th-century house".
The building was suitable but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is decaying more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calling it "House 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opened with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in some way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the same name foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he sensibly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he extended it and was awarded the contest, but also because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy devourer," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light descending between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in antique mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," Krischanitz says and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The pavilion "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that’s why I wanted to “awaken the right consciousness.”
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been an urbanistic stroke of luck. The completely new and planned "central station neighborhood", with houses and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck happens: House 21 could receive reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary Berlin art room and, as one hears, negotiates with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train outages in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against train outages and delays caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of the planned investments until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
In order to achieve this, better availability of vehicles and of the rail network must be achieved even in extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean the platforms of snow and ice for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation in the term of four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train failures and delays also this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years on checking the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the breaking of an axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the U.S.
After the tumult over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem arises, the Deutsche Bank must pay there a million dollar fine.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in a deal, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
Financial market regulator NCUA blames many large banks for inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank admits no guilt with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a $20.5 million payment.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
The NCUA seeks to reimburse the losses of millions.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also sought accounts from other large banks and filed summer lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble erupted in 2007, it led to the destruction of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, it currently blows a tricky wind for American banks.
Investors and the inspection have undergone countless processes to receive compensation or sanction faults.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the most demands.
He reproaches the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a claim from the FHFA, which is worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to be held accountable for "substantial losses", without giving an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
Finance guru Buffett is investing heavily in information technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology as the forecasts for the long-term development of companies are negative.
But he has read the IBM business report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM primarily provides services and procures computer systems for information technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technology should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed on CNBC that he has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway of investments has thus raised one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM hasn’t known anything about the compromise so far.
He praised the leadership that dealt with ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long established lucrative information technology services such as the operation of computing centers.
The old computer pioneer of more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett seized the opportunity on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has approximately 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His fast and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM stocks on the stock exchange rose by one percent.
“The Blue Giant,” as IBM is known, has a stock value of more than $220 billion and ranks, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable tech companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he does not want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The Threat Is Concrete
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is revived again.
The murders of eight small Greek and tricky entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that had long been thought dead returns, since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of extreme right-wing violence against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The uncovered far-right network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were far from predictable.
“Is the bloody ideology revived again?”, headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper “Haberturk”.
The newspaper "Sabah" notes, on the contrary, that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant to the Federal Office of the Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be implicated in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, the weekend reminded victims of racist violence with a vigil outside the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act on the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged in cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The news came to some Turkish media as a slap: “The German gift for the 50th anniversary,” says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform “Haber X,” referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says the headline of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He points out that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that German authorities have not searched for suspects in the far-right circle long ago.
Some are the least rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on here you are lost, the immigrants are left with nothing but self-defense and armament."
“This will be the best self-protection.”
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network," writes "Selen".
This means that if Germany’s internal peace is in jeopardy, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memoirs.
No other event more clearly showed the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was then mainly criticized for the deficiency of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the German Turks contributed with taxes.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country has since been.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The bank of the Lake Zurich scandal
Europe’s most risky bank is not found in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
It is now run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit in July, it became known that in 2013 he would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of directors of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber rejoices publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops kind remarks about his future colleagues.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I am happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the security systems of the bank and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the board of directors of the USB since then considered himself equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber is expected to advise the bank in February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors in May, not in early 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and counselor and has had a period of adaptation that is surely necessary.
He suddenly takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven again that it deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it slips from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss property manager, but also handsome, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
At $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s big banks.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "In front of my students, I have always rated USB as a model of a good bank."
“From the current point of view, one asks: How could I be wrong?”
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To charge with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, naturally that some looked with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque Singapore state fund and an Arab state fund, so discreet that its name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, in 2006 in Switzerland’s second highest-paid board of directors, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS was in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought troubled securities from the UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it affirmed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times greater than Switzerland’s economic performance (see chart).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said banking expert Geiger.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over data on wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursing unjustified profits from these businesses with a payment compensation.
With this, UBS confessed more or less to having helped in tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for wealthy customers: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank’s secret is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
Thus, within a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculation and in the administration of assets through aid to tax fraud.
And just as it was getting a little quieter, just as you thought UBS was getting it again, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still does not work well with risk management in investment banking.
“The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also sure: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t master risk controls.”
So came the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had long presented themselves, to be the guardians of the greatest goods in the world: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered in Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry shops like Tiffany<0x60>s among traditional Swiss businesses like Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse palace, to the elite private banks like Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS by means of a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are lined with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bench there is a large sign to indicate "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small private Swiss bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
The UBS has become too big, he thinks, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small seven-million-dollar country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they come up with it?
They talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleeping bank with the center of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could ride a great financial bike.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from learning at the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: The insanity came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Getting off the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the banks’ success.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well for him.
In foreign exchange trading and in stock trading it was at the top.
However, the advisers to commissioned companies highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of banking "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Aid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk U.S. investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine for securitizing U.S. mortgage loans and then selling them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks he sought the downturn for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
The positions at UBS have become projectable seats and are unsafe to this day.
Nowadays, whoever runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a banking expert, has an idea, end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking must decline a lot, it is clear today.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he imposed himself: He must run the business of UBS permanently, the bank of Zurich announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to restore the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Removing 3,500 positions.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is surely asking today.
So far he only says that he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The imminent recession in Europe has scaren American investors earlier this week.
The changes in government in Athens and Rome are still not vigorous.
Industrial production slowed down on the continent stifles the hopes of stabilizing a debt crisis at its origin.
General relief on government changes in Rome and Athens might not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has looked half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of standard values closed down 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.

Companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat’s statistical office.
What created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We are not an island, if not dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
That is why, from their point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws over a decade of old principles and enters the American tech sector.
Its more than $10 billion investment in IBM supports the share price of the traditional consortium and makes it trade against the trend in the market at first just a percentage higher.
The value closed almost unchanged at $187.35.

Smart Grails Spread in Cities
In many places grits are considered "problem birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grasses belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors accumulate over the crap and the noise of the animals.
Although no means have appeared against "problem birds" so far.
Grails no longer leave cities, experts say at the first Grail Symposium in Read, East Friesland.
There specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field of certain protected grails; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end traditional living spaces.
Hunting, growing building and falling trees make life difficult for birds.
The greys are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to mass kill the district’s grails jumped into the negative headlines of the press.
Critics have called hunting animals through bird traps and stick killing especially brutal.
"By expelling them and driving them away in a normal way, nothing can be achieved," said Werner Klöver, urban planner and landscape designer at Leer.
Shooting nests with water or throwing trees are often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
“The animals are diverted, the great colonies are divided and distributed elsewhere.”
Avoiding them is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we don’t catch them anymore.”
Without the surroundings, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals away from sensitive residential areas and baits to resettle elsewhere is possible.
"Informative panels instead of chainsaws" Uta Maria Jürgens, a psychologist and ethnologist, advertises against it in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can stand a spike in the face with a pledge."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on the Ascheberger grails, where signs inform about the life of intelligent birds.
In the meantime, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on criticisms of bird noise: "All are forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grasses not only take advantage of the resources to access shale bits, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge have checked in four grids how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second essay, the cunning grits had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they caught the bucket in the shooter of the tube.
Three of the four greys got it on the first try.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope for the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the latest Euro 2012 banknotes in the play-offs in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal scored for Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the one-way game, made the five European Cup appearances in a row.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs back game with outsider Montenegro, after in the one-way game (2-0) they made things clear.
Croatia did not let them score in 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland won a 1-1 (1-0) loss against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored Portugal’s other goals.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic won a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South African World Cup play-offs.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a direct free from more than 30 meters to get to the top in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his dowry to score from a distance and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not play in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, the English leader of Manchester City sent a header to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek hit right for the Czech Republic
Then, college fellow Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark hit a controversial penalty following an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European runner-up cleared everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished with the last doubt in the 81th minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualifies for the fifth consecutive time for the European Championship.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a reaction second in the initial phase.
In the last minute, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflex a possible goal in Tomas Sivok’s own door (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the lap of the front, very right on Cech's goal.
After the break, the Czechs had to protect the world-famous goalkeeper’s barrage, the FC Seoul striker escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the marvel of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink was to leave his seat at the 2002 World Cup third, the Croatians celebrated their fourth appearance in the Euro Cup final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dreamlike beginning.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan was only able to touch the pole.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow any goals to be scored.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made way for Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the European Cup
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate the first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who won 4-0 in the one-way match prepared for a previous decision, to the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
From the outset, the Estonian defense avoided possible lead goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he pushed it forward.
After a defense from goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, getting 1-0.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story about World War I, “begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one fall one’s soul to one’s feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novelist narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he rightly describes as “an anti-history work.”
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as “a book about how it happened.” It’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods.”
"The beauty and pain of battle" combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go mad, or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mix while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund’s book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a correction to the notion that World War I was only the fatal trench war on the Western front.
"The Beauty and Pain of Battle" expertly moves through other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall over the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
“Lack of facts,” notes Mr. Englund, “has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"The Beauty and Pain of Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the offshore fleet.
His stories have been obtained for the most part from memoirs, letters and other material already published earlier.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and dealing with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says, "Substitute everywhere."
"Succession of coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about the substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into ram fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and dried potato peels; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, he notes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and manifests about war: “You feel that, after all, this is what men are conceived for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starchy and stained breast.”
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will find out or care.
“Once one resigns to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar "to a convict being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass killer in fine-fashioned clothes running his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both ignoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of evading service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and embroider their genitals with in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often gives rise to lifelong blindness.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war has “unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People begin to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's Modern Memory, or novels such as No novelty at the front of Erich María Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
The volume of Mr. Englund joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had come from his book, torn that page of dramatis personae out of your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a previous false step, a planned assault at the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
The night was chosen from Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscored how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
Episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, breaking departmental rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the “occupies.”
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
Agents had prepared by watching how occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye facing Zuccotti.
Agents increased so-called disorder training — counter-terrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park arrived at the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
“To the few cops I know who were called for this, they didn’t tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park,” said the person, who spoke anonymously.
“The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department.”
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park but gave up when hundreds of protesters came up early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from across the city's district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said a lot of people, like those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do it when there were the fewest people in the park,” he said.
Emergency Service Unit trucks with spotlights and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages ranging from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windbreaks, many protesters just picked up their things and left.
No stores were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving the protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said attempts were made to prevent police from seeing action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by officers.
Mr Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved westward through the protesters’ dense swamp of personal belongings, including baggage and garbage bags of paper and plastic stuff stuffed with clothes, Cleaning Department teams followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, images appearing on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took up positions near the camp kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp candid for each other’s arms.
And two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service officers were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for “altering public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the uniformed senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the chief detective of the department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "wasn't directing the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block to the north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block to the south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air off the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalized.
Support Workers Union to sue City for layoffs
The union that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, alleging the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, the 37th municipal district, in its effort to revoke the redundancies.
Sixty-seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s lowest-paid lost their jobs on Oct. 7, in a move that union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal last spring to allow the city access to a health care fund by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that charge.
At a City Hall hearing last month, education adviser Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council counterattacked him by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
37 district officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that he would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as defendants, and counts eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all of whom are black or Latina women, like most assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees as they had been underfunded chronically.
While there were no redundancies on Staten Island and a few redundancies at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendees lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight attendees employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.D. District 36’s budget fell 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" more often describes the act of moving a payroll teacher from a school to a job exchange, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
“Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,” the complaint’s draft says, “and not just in surplus.”
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats at the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi to be captured and murdered, and for America’s involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It’s an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were quarreling with each other and the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it never came to a vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory — with Congress annoyed enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually harvest the grass under his feet.
Then Congress’s indecision was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was assassinated on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee’s resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves” and “praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure gain full support from the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide legislators as did the June bill?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar’s spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
Across the Capitol, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that will actually achieve a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to bring their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced at this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that will "control federal spending."
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but give their sponsors — especially rookie Republicans looking to refine their resumes — the opportunity to boast that they were the “authors” of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can hold, while Rep. José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one banning the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the override of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as the members have been when it comes to proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and submitted 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot her to death at a constituent act in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat for Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing along with the Broadway melody "The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow" and saying she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In her appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41, replied, “Good enough.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special “20/20” program, which aired on the eve of the release of the couple’s new book, “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special program looked at Giffords' recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar traversing her forehead.
She can only hold one or two fingers upright while her husband cheers her up.
Months later, he sees Giffords sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A frown of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast," a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn’t remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to first ask about the six who had died in the incident.
Suspected gunman Jared Lee Loughner is detained in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been beaten.
And you’re going to get out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to come back stronger than ever.”
Troops make you feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines broke into their posts around him.
The label crowd stood up and cheered.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then president of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They showed them as some kind of orphaned child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The strikingly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been seized by the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring American public.
The troops are exalted with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if they are sorry for those uniformed.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most talks about pity take place silently and privately among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an "angry and violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to endure under the pressure of a demanding job from Washington immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling her children.
Military concern arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praises of politicians and the public largely focus on the depth of the suffering of a service member.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a package of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded an alarm signal,” Lyman says.
However, the Texas native left aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman’s room, the man approached him from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he alleges.
This week, Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision at a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether their lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or impart adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the army's flat, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have contacted her, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy — in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the army to modernize, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other lawsuits are underway in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veteran Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on the diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to give them discharge from service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefits claims for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been presented in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense’s Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response.
However, the assaults are notably underreported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, which amount to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial – half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe his attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 different times to a multitude of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her assailant — from a cut in her arm — was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"I was put in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember telling my commanding officer, "That was not his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed from service on less-than-honorable terms, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow lawsuits continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, “In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.”
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn’t have the same incentive and deterrence that poses responsibility.
“The odds are strongly against them ... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go its way, Burke, the plaintiffs’ attorney, will put her other hundreds of plaintiffs in line for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform takes place,” he says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a killing in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to reach them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British study center DEMOS.
Facebook’s stash of personal information is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine its desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy — the way marketers have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million right-wing group fans across Europe and then directed ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
Upon arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s a whole new way to do an investigation,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not at all surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry at immigration.
“Those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems to social trends as expressed in “likes”, messages on walls, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom, pushing the number of academic papers with the site’s name in the title to nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach with a folder on the street.
“Before, when you tried to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You’d have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunkenness feats on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the topic.
Moreno suggests that students’ peers, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student post too many status updates with their drunkenness.
“You can’t treat a problem if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Child Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly “punching” its own population for data.
The Site Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine’s Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed – digital freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make available to others their abundance of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not – the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that carried out with students’ public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know what part of a user’s profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about the social — and a lot of the social still happens offline.”
Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway,” he told a room filled with 500 people.
“I oppose the court because it has received the mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "I did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
They all attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
“I thought it looked cold and inhuman,” one Utoya survivor told Norwegian radio station NRK.
“It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.”
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange notion of being part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
It may comfort some that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically ease the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
“I would like it to look like a monster, but it doesn’t,” said a relative of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it seemed so."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Missing Interview Shown at Theater This Week
Following the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been dusted as a preview of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flowcharts - a man who believed many executives suffered "a disease consisting of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds over the dawn of the personal computer, and sat down for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At the time, it had barely been 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working heavily on his new computer company NeXT, awaiting popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used on Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during its transport.
It was only after Jobs's death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This footage, slightly re-edited, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Missing 68-Minute Interview, which hits Landmark theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and the answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient due to Cringely’s questions, pushing him to go faster toward the most important topics or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic about The Missing Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, it was and it did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Missing Interview:
About how you learned to run a business:
“Throughout the years in the business, I always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers that you invariably get are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs details his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Disconcerted by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made with a good eye, and then adjusted with a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that assured that they could determine commercial costs in detail.
The Joke to the Pope:
Jobs recounts the "Blue Box" he built himself with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and you were screaming through the public phone and coming back a minute later to the public phone next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke he and Wozniak nearly abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the U.S. diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the pope himself was awakened to go and answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling over the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call to him.
Soon after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a summer part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
Improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Soon in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a customer if he could assemble the whole equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments ... I was screaming that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and it was totally reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s revival, Jobs prophetically foresaw how many industry leaders would stumble upon his vision, and lose control of their market share.
“Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, and what?”
You have a monopoly on market share, so the company is no longer successful.
The sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is these kinds of people who end up leading the companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The product genius that led to that monopoly position rots because of people who do not have the notion of good vs. bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
“There’s a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't make the electrons do, the glass does them, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end, it all boils down to taste – it boils down to trying to expose you to the best a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to what you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been embarrassed about stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were accidentally the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law rivals while court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama’s healthcare law, two of his magistrates, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were treated to a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states defying the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a cry of war for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit, and in fact a historic five-and-a-half-hour allegation is expected by March, and the result is likely to further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court’s decision becomes known.
The attorney who will appear in court and argue that the law must be discarded will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, a group that has been devoted to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the law-defying trade associations, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most prominent Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the healthcare law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, they could be said to fall under the Canon Code 4C, which says: “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related and other organizations, although the judge cannot be a speaker, an honorary guest, or feature in the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia and Thomas’ absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This impressive breach of ethics and indifference to the code goes against the lawsuits of several judges that the court adheres to by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were gayed at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say they too easily mix the court’s activity with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’ wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Attorney General of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in upholding the law to now be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that he will.
Boeing Receives Record Order of $18 Billion
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 double-aisle aircraft, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is the aircraft maker Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 aircraft amounts to a record $18 billion.
It is as big as the place from which Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft for its dollar value - 50 Boing 777 double-aisle jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts spectacular fuel savings and passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is more than $1 billion.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,” Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to airlines, because it is one of the highest costs - is not so detrimental, because the country is making money from the rise in the price of oil.
That’s important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates’ order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS’s attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger aircraft at bay.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5 percent to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón says the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor’s contest.
President Felipe Calderón's sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the violent state's elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the Western state to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... They seized the ballot boxes, they installed barricades... and they ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly outpaced Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate for his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates left the local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant Michoacán’s election may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, for next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to prevent a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two fastest-growing major economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that are observing Europe’s difficulties in a “impartial” way and said that Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune.”
“So if China and India can help, let it be by all means.”
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has heightened fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to unite to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any Asian support would be channeled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance — such as the purchase of bonds from the EU’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund — offered greater bargaining power for Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s Commerce Minister, said “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depletion of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility in helping wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India’s one billion two hundred thousand people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss-making such as railroads.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens to have “significant chain effects” across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing “downside risks” due to Europe’s threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warnings about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that the looming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to Afghanistan’s battlefields, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said Congress’ failure to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called “kidnapping,” would result in 23 percent global cuts and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects unable to be executed - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntarily remove many of our civilian officials and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the goal.”
"These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and would seriously damage the willingness."
The cuts would eventually reach combat troops, Panetta said.
"While funding for wartime in overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the abduction, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in core budgets," Panetta said.
“The hiring of personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract that supports the war.”
“Staff on payroll would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a abduction in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are strongly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is not a result with which you can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“Abduction is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the senators’ recent warnings will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, even though she came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing she was facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Secretary painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a boat without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission,” Panetta said in her opening remarks at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries.”
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to her letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how the reductions “generate significant operational risks: delays response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and pre-committed around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could cope with the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
Administrators at Pennsylvania State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired soccer coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “stacked” with an open microphone asserting U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner ridiculed his denials quickly denied by the irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given exam responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and deceiving are acceptable.
How much cheating do we find?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Many of these lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies," is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been refuted.
Liars look into the eyes.
They don’t always stutter, babble, blush or worry.
It cannot be concluded either that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, questioning, and times.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel comfortable, handling their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-oriented lies," while women say more "other-oriented lies" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they usually say tend to be "normal").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called “creating a baseline.”
It helps provide benchmarks to measure changes afterwards.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
It’s best to know if someone normally punches their foot all the time so as not to make unfair accusations when they see their feet punching in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal, and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as warning signs, not as evidence of deception.
Deceiving people can freeze their upper body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a “post-interview relief” — that exaggerated sigh of relief and posture change once all the difficult questions are over.
Often interrogators falsely show that the interview is over only to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up to the bottom and used the past time while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a national search for her.
People who deceive can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... up to what I know... to my mind."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will enhance anyone’s chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial Pipeline Plan Diverted Following Threat of U.S. Delay in Approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating unions, while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true with a different route.
This comes after last week’s announcement by the State Department that they would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until potential new routes are studied to avoid Nebraska’s Sandhills areas and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast groundwater supply.
“This is a true path of progress,” Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decisions until 2013, following next year’s elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as the State Department’s petition, and expressed their full support.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to refineries in Texas.
For this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a boy to vomit in fear
A New York family claims disco diva Patti LaBelle behaved like crazy in the lobby of her Manhattan building, scaring her little daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
"Lady Marmalade" singer Genevieve Monk was so frightened that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when plotter Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk walked down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
“Someone came up from behind and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said, ‘Yes,’ and I went to get her,” she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
“He said in an aggressive tone, ‘I shouldn’t have left her daughter near the door,’” Roseanna Monk said.
“I said, ‘I have no interest in what you say or think.’
He became angry and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J aloud...
He had a bottle of water and started pouring the water out of the bottle on me.”
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,' said the girl's mother.
LaBelle stumbled upon the mother -- who still held Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her surroundings and withdrawn to a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud she vomited, he added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no answer.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it can get to a supportive association for children with cancer.
“The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when addressing a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez’s management in Sinaloa, unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment dropped and the economy contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-described change, which generated high expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity at the beginning of the year, there is no growth, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses to the agricultural sector, limited the chances of the state economy to grow, causing a 3.6 percent contraction in overall economic activity in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic 31.16 percent decline in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost damage, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares of crops were damaged, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops damaged were vegetables, corn and chickpea.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the state's unemployment rate rose from $6.000 to $6.000 in the first three quarters of the year, with an increase of $6.000 from $6.000 to $6.000.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
“What is being seen is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market by the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who grab dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest them and use them for something,” he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties to enter, and secondly because they already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, those people are staying and they are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labor market in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being quoted as a worker at any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state’s job shortfalls are low wages, the entity has the lowest remuneration in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of workers in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was recorded in 2011, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June of the state FDI totaled $630,697, representing a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the $5 million,143,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt (disambiguation)
In the face of the scenario of economic contraction, the state government in July requested the state congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, the same that would be destined for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2.6 billion pesos, and until November have not observed the benefits of the sector in debt nor
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, Mario López Valdés’ first year of government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
“The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, lacked align the effort of all and especially the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo Lopez said events like the frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that it is necessary to cause the state to productive activities of greater dynamism.
“In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is deterred,” he said.
Work to be done
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better guided the Government ' s efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been striving to achieve good results in various areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important that a long-term programme is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
“There are elements to say that the government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done,” he said.
He was convicted of 8 kg of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fine for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General’s Office reported that the sentenced narcomenudist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of Post 80, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomenudist was driving in a pick-up truck, white, where he carried a black bag in the car’s box and in the co-driver’s seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person remains internally in the Center for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Contributions to works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that, although the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk because they have not complied with the State Government ' s contributions, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these becomes in force.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part, "he said, "we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that belonged to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute at that time.
“It has happened to us in the previous six years because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year in order to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the State left pending,” he said.
Although there is the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them arrive as soon as possible.
“It’s almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven’t given us a fifth.”
Corte valida "analogue blackout" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies brought by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree that advances the so-called “analogous blackout” from 2021 to 2015, failing to gather the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to complete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and by admitting the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions therein arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the demand made by the Chamber of Deputies, without going into the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister-president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not think that if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the Federal Executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the state rectory.
The replacement of analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and results in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitisation, which involves a decision in the public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectory of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, has in some way invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress, for the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative is being provided in the administrative sphere, he assured.
The possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP the difference between first and second place of the election of governor is just 27 percent, still not counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the governor's election is just 27 percent, still without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,000 total 74 minutes.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize the local rules with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not homologate his Political Constitution or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their publication within the deadlines provided in the State Official Newspaper Act, with the argument that he had.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislature and called the state president’s vote on constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal,” since he has no right to “sanction or veto them.”
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the EEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may take place in the event that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no act of scrutiny and counting in the file of the box or does not work in the possession of the president of the same; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the election in question and the candidate who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the party representative and/or coalition that nominated the second candidate.
The total vote count may also be made if at the end of the ordinary count it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case electoral packages that have been partially counted are excluded.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is just 0.16 percent, although not counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
Their ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, during Monday reconnaissances and a requiem mass were held.
According to his relatives the last will of the lieutenant colonel was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving a tribute from the other people killed in the accident, Bacio Cortés’ family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attending the ceremony at Campo Mars.
At twelve noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived the veiling chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garza boulevard, where they were arriving family and friends.
At 5:30 p.m., he was recognized at the Saltillo Technological Institute organized by his former colleagues from the high school and the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was a part during his high school preparation.
"His will was to return to Saltillo and his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, he always manifested it to his family and friends," Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister, said.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, considering that he was in the fullness of his life, "was a successful man, extraordinary as a father, as a son, a loving brother and in the care of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Colegio del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he was even dizzying in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "only was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for his family member's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: flying an aircraft.
They give you the last goodbye
With honors was fired the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, in tribute to the governor Jorge Torres Lopez, and that gave him people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, directors and students of the Tecnológico de Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and stood out.
Bacio Cortés died in recent days when the helicopter he piloted collapsed, along with the secretary of the governorate, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of that unit.

Three abandoned corpses found on Cadereyta farm NL
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found gunned down in different parts of the body and shot by grace, on an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find happened on the 1.5 kilometer of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by the place observed that in the fifth, whose bard is beige with coffee, was the gate wide open.
Looking inwards, about three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, so they immediately notified the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow shirt with dark denim pants, without shoes; next to him was another one with white straps.
Just a meter away was the body of another individual wearing a red shirt and blue denim pants.
All three were upside down.
According to data obtained at the site, the three people were reportedly killed elsewhere, as no caps were found at the site.
In the bard of the fifth one can see legends that are directed from one organized crime group to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
Captured 11 in Cadereyta
The Secretariat of National Defence presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are associated with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" and clandestine burials.
According to the information released, in a first fact on November 11 in the colony Los Alveros eight people were arrested and managed to rescue one who remained deprived of their liberty.

When they were stopped and inspected, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested in the ejido La Frauda, who, seeing the military tried to escape.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a mostly technocrat cabinet, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The “framework is now well outlined,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain beaten confidence in Italy.
Underscoring pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets put the yield of Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of the Italian employers' group Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced him to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are meant to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocrat-majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be made up of only technicians, an indication of their dismay at a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of the Spaniards is higher than that of the Ticos
Of the 22 soccer players called from Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 rallies reached the 50 games.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 called by both countries for today’s friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly ranking, have an extensive record of inter-class A games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a as the only one that has all 50 international games.
That figure reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers playing in the All-Star League and in powerful Premier League clubs of England, maintain yearly intense activity in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level clashes in European cups such as Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Tico players, on the other hand, have limited international friction in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish national team is from the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who on Saturday before against England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international encounters.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona’s brain steering wheel, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized by UEFA the previous week along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the ram of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and close to Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a, are left-back Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five beat the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 performances in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't getting close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar owns only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
Spain’s historic scorer is David Villa with 50 targets, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most with nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country on its two-decade-long celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band asserts that for them, too, it will be turning the dream of playing in the country into reality.
This was assured by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its two-decade work celebration tour and will make its only stop in Central America on Sunday 20th.
On that day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside the angel band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is in The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I ask you because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What do they say to their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to his concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the past 21 years happened over the past couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really look forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Watching the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this about?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all they have achieved?
Yeah, absolutely.
“First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined we’d be in a great rock band and having done it for more than 20 years makes it feel like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love creating music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something rare.
Occasionally, a band emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
“Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with them all still and honor us to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we are all fortunate to be still alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance sheet?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you’re not too touring because it’s easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without being incensed for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for nearly three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and most importantly we are still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and soccer and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to his mind.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the bands that came up at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s a wonderful thing because it’s music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the cause of this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that might seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there is some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is admitted again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his GP said.
Fujimori, 72, who serves a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a cancer of the tongue for which he has been operated four times and which remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he is known to be innocent.
He was operated four times on cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos and has been joined by other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in custody since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official entourage, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican peer, Felipe Calderón, the highest point on an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda spread by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "suitable for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations," the South American country's presidency posted on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a declaration that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation of its ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group made up of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the realization of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that have not implemented all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustache plumber passes all three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tirelessly, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before had it done in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which hits stores around the world this month, has been designed from the ground up to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses should work,” Omar Alvarez, Nintendo’s head of specialized press in Spain, said during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support" , as hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth gameplay.
Alvarez has claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most skilled players will be able to make a "second turn" to the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This foray of Super Mario in all three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that did not happen since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo makes nods to the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of success of the previous installments, consisting in that the moustache plumber will have to travel through platforms mined with dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new moves, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has filed for the extradition of former ruler Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This is how the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that was claiming Portillo to try him there ends.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and executive powers, taking into account that a judgment court had already ordered extradition.
He asserted that during his tenure he "did not get his hands" on court decisions and processed all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, they will be extradited Sergio Ruano Marroquín, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What was done by Colom is an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional bodies were exhausted to prosecute the former president from 2000 to 2004.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has settled his legal status in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by the defamation of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process before the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the fall in marginality of untrained children
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the social support institution Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
In addition to this, there are currently 100 jobs for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex, which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradition or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the midst of the electoral period, showed the unity of Trinijove’s work.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former socialist education adviser, Ernest Maragall, and the deputy mayor and current ecosocialist councilor Ricard Gom<0xC3><0xA0>.
The current counselor of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the large hall of the Fabra i Coats.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is nothing new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Evicted an occupying farm where macrofiestas were made
The invaders had seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare of the 51st Street residents of Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday noon the property they were illegally occupying, and where they organized macroparties that were desperate to the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
“From now on there will be an access control,” the administrator said.
The okupas, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowded parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the invaders of the estate made her unfair competition, since they sold the cups for three euros, while in the discotheque they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had had to respond to neighboring complaints for noise, while, he pointed out, the inconvenience is not caused by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupying house and, above all, the attendees to the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The manager of the disco explained that the inconveniences were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that she "forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "immediately evict the property to end the problems of coexistence and civics that produce to the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the past few months the okupas had been entering every floor of the building and almost every floor, and that in some even thefts had occurred.
In this sense, he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivity that has been generated on the farm".
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police headed to 35 de la rue de Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies about fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some Collserola promotional pasches.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What’s more, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that do not orientate on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these it was until, in September, the city hall called a mega competition composed of 16 contests for as many other gateways to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put doors to the field.
The question comes out on its own: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both because of its purely organizational aspect and because of what it means to reflect on the city, is the subject of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme when two members of this former caste of elect recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel M<0xC3><0xB2>dol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to debate about "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerd<0xC3><0xA0>, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"We can start from the basis that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things due to its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "Collserola gates" encloses a "lexical trap": one should not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where one has to act".
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and had in the area of the Forum "your song of the swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of boundaries on where one can build.
“Limiting something is already fixing the next step,” that is, its overtaking.
“We have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters.”
More closely to the question, M<0xC3><0xB2>dol believes that, simplifying, the Collserola valley slope "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", by a purely topographical question.
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronate of Collserola that "must not fall into a broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers his guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a whole success," he points out) that have had to be created: "Architects should only be a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because the basis of the contest lacks a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-country competitions have been convened in the mountain-to-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
This leads, at least where appropriate, to the fact that he has chosen to participate in all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the next door architect.
In his view, yes, the city should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino pardons Jonas Larrazábal and will be released free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal deputy of Casino Red granted pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by him for alleged blackmail.
After being imprisoned for 72 days, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal deputy of Casino Red granted him pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which is prosecuted for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonás demanded the payment of an economic fee for the city council to allow the clandestine operation of the bookmaker.
Following the public denunciation, the State Prosecutor’s Office opened criminal proceedings against the mayor’s brother and on 2 September he was arrested and entrenched for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor’s Office 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to Casa de Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He stayed there for 49 days after a second rooting order was issued after the Public Prosecution Officer dismissed the crimes of robbery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
Authorities allowed him to follow the trial interned in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, said that nearly two months of inquiries proved enough evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
This Monday, the legal deputy of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to the judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the royal mayor; so that in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal due diligence, the Public Prosecutor’s agent attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal and henceforth no claim can be made regarding the process that followed him; in addition to that he will not be required to reparation for damages or punishment.
After the hearing to the legal deputy of the bookmaker, about 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which the secretary of the governorate, Francisco Blake, and seven more people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results thrown over the accident where the secretary of state, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"Elements that appear to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees 25 meters away where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact area do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search they report that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented in a structural way.
“The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements for transporting the passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary said it is a priority to have the results before possible; however, the investigation can last several months, it could even reach a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director general of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Staff operated at cruise speed and that this happened in a soft upward terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations the flight was performed under the visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM placed appropriate conditions for take-off, as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presented layers of cloudiness at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloud conditions the crew has sought a zone of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last radar aircraft record match, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and sideways trajectory.
The aircraft’s debris dispersion pattern allows us to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the accident there is still no evidence revealed in the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the field.
During fieldwork, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above average sea level, the terrain presents a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disjointed along that path.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the cordoned site, around the crash, no dispersed parts of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the presumption that the impact was presented under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security conducts research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity' protocol, which will allow markers associated with overweight to be counted.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, the population is invited to participate, whether or not they are entitled, to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests for minors are carried out, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Mexico State Poniente) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Mexico State East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 children is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and youth to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
At World Diabetes Day on 14 November, he said the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific dietary questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and hereditary family history of diseases, with the purpose of avoiding risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
On Saturdays, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure measurement, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetics (seeking to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity) are applied to all participants.
Cruz Lopez noted that this research owes to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight there was also a dramatic increase," the IMSS specialist said.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others by its genetic history.
On average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indian American, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage, and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive assessment of the children, which allows to detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood that he will suffer from metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors give it in writing to parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV for most of the day, and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high calorie intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (sizes, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics that is analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid bumps
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the pavement were answered, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 bumps each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a full-fledged researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement were to be reduced, they could be removed.
A technological opinion of the bumps, dictated within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory in charge of it develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and thus the formation of bumps.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that on the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is changing during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt binder, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By moving the vehicles and generating efforts, it allows the forces to diffuse very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt binder, abundant, is placed a last layer called rolling binder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt bin and provide friction along the way.
As it is the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the stresses, the rolling pad also requires to have the proper thickness and the material from which it is made should be taken care.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt bin.
When the ground is moistened, the water diffuses inside the folder and it is difficult to come out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
In the process of forming a bump, he said, the first to wear out is the rolling film and only then the asphalt binder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to the first signals with proper maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Investigators explained that vehicle loading is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each of the pavement layers should always be in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is complied with, to prevent bumps forming frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to be researched and worked on the asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair the bumps with ease and without the need to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate of the Valley to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of princess.
Once again the Cauca Valley gets the desire of the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico rose with the crown and the scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the Legion of Vallecaucan women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), María Alva (Gire)
Today the big question that many ask themselves is, What was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation proved that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that won queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision made by the jury to designate her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
At the interrogation the vallecaucan replied:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way of being cultural, I definitely think the book that marked me from childhood is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
Currently I read Crime and Punishment, it is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called The Burning of Blood.
A response that he hardly liked first by the term “to be cultured” and second by not explaining concretely how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise passes what has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses put forward it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotá journalist suggested that being the favorite, the ovated and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomic challenge, vote of the public for the best handmade costume, and Reina Madre), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why it didn't shine on the stage."
And that was noticed in her first swimsuit presentation at the Hilton beach and her two parades at the coronation evening.
Although she looked safe in both, it was noted that she lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for RCN’s “Come At Home” program, said Melina’s appointment as a princess “checks that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest doesn’t stay as a queen.”
In addition, Valle was very elusive to the press, and there he was mistaken.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For some reason, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, that before entering the Competition are already involved in projects,” he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for his defects in the back and fibrosis that was noticed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The queens’ trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, “but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth to me was not very noticeable, dropped her points on the last day.”
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the vallecaucan were the surgical interventions that were practiced.
“The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her stronghold and here she was collected.”
For this prize, which for the first time gives the National Beauty Competition, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel prediction emerged that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contentment that Raymundo granted to Melina not to give the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that from today Melina begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was dodging her crown.
This was the work of the Cale<0xC3><0xB1>o who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lophoscopist from the CTI of Cali went on to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the highest head of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", through the comparison of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists who work in the section of the ITC, that week was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days in the jungle to reach the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after completing the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar was warned to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big awaited him.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be from the man who was leading the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to carry the decadactylar card of William Leon Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigative team to the site where the corpse was, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the card.
His eye did not fail: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the chief of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a fingerprinter from Sijín de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can become key in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present false or undocumented ballots.
We take the fingerprint and search for them in the database.
The investigator said that in a case of theft, it was up to him to remove a piece of a wall from a house, because there the thief had supported his hand to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to make a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts,” he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently they found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that it was the killer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprinter explained that in the objects "the fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplantator or ribbon is used to lift them.
After this, impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented,” said the CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI TV show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a mark.
However, if it can be used, if the respective matching is performed.
“Indignant” Defies New York Authorities
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended to the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The Occupy Wall Street movement on Tuesday challenged New York authorities by trying to re-enter, under a court order, Manhattan Square from where they were evicted early in the morning and by trying to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the “outraged” to return to camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to re-camp in the square, we will settle down somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ups and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray said the “outraged” response to the eviction of his camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the site and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "outraged" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, while assuring Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been displaced in support of members of the movement and that it has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned enclosure - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the protesters displaced there were carrying and distributing copies of that court order at this time and even handing them over to the agents guarding the square, which provoked "some small clashes," Bray said, who denounced that some officers had beaten the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing “laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with stores or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to resettle with tents and sleeping bags.
The governor personally defended the early morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people would not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, harm other people," because "some businesses would have received threats" and neighbors would fear "for their quality of life."
“This morning’s eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is deeply more interested in preserving financial interests than those of U.S. workers,” the movement’s spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “lacking respect for freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they plan to hold “great actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two-month-long protests, which began Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special TV Christmas
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement," a lifeguard on "Baywatch," a bunny on "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian TV Christmas special.
Private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on Dec. 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread distribution on the internet of a pornographic home video in which he appears along with her then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently acted as host in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the country has suffered since World War II.
Early estimates by the Government of Tokyo amounted to $300 billion in material losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to pass page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest pace of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the upturn in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas ravaged by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% fall in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revolt of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen – or rebuild – infrastructures, to use the shortfalls to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable escalated by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "safe haven values" chosen by investors fleeing the euro zone debt crisis and the cloudy U.S. forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products become more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of large tech groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September on the yen price.
While markets continue to besiege the EU’s peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower its guard.
“We need to be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed stronger signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator anticipating tipping points in the global economy highlighted that major powers are slowing down.
It dropped four-tenths to 100.4 points, up from August’s 100.8.
The euro area even fell below the 100-level average, with eight-tenths down to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums skyrocketing and uncertainty re-established in parquets, Greece continues to become entangled in the maze leading to the exit from the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support further austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the planned date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit on October 26," Papadimos said in the opening of a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the officials disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear up doubts about his position: “We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he will not give his approval to any pledge letter of compliance with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still chosen for the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written compromise unambiguously and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of $8 billion, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greek tree still has thread for a while.
Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "predominant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place globally in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" pointed out that it lies in being a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations with 2015, and, "very especially, in the one whose goal is to reduce the volume of people living with incomes less than a dole".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are “many of the achievements achieved” and “many of the challenges we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is proposed not only as a forum for debate, but also as a platform from which to push “two basic goals.”
Thus, Her Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, it is hoped that 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that 100 million of those households will come out of the poverty line they are plunged into.
The momentum in the conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path pioneered years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighting Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an “admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty”, whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution," explained Her Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "head of the family" assembled in Valladolid by the "baker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez warned that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, he explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic well-being, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said microcredit is a “serious and rigorous policy devoted to eradicating poverty,” and now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, went without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe had initially not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those militants who consider that the government's policy is currently too unstrict with the Greeks and could be so in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted virtually unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes won, with their speeches, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the eutrophic Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in one slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, “the time has come to make its way in Europe.”
This could be manifested in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to allow the European Union to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly Wolfgang Schäuble's idea.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the field.
On the other hand, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the weight of each country's directive by the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm the moods within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it is not that she has attempted to win her congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for passing.
Remembering that two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
After the subsidies, the UMP and the government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a box responsible for family allowances and to deliver a speech on the topic, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the willingness to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sickness casualties.
First, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose on private sector workers a fourth day off before they can catch the loss.
In short, unless a specific company agreement exists, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of wages, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing on officials a day of absence without remuneration in the event of unemployment (to date, they have no shortage, compared to the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority also put on the table the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuse of job losses.
"Controls are going to be increased considerably and, in addition, if someone is found committing fraud, they will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned on Sunday, Nov. 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of job loss fraud.
In fact, since 2002, this issue has been constantly monitored and a number of policy offensives have been launched that have normally been successful.
The French do not get sicker than in the rest of Europe.
Let us first look closely at the national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), over 237 million euros were paid in 2006 in benefits for unemployment losses.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, in 2008, casualty subsidies accounted for 5% of health expenditure, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54% is related to sickness, a figure amounting to 6.2 billion euros.
Therefore, 2.5% of the expenditure on health.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to get sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health reasons and other reasons) in France ranged from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term discharges were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be " duly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, starting from a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases were reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
No doubt a negligible figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between €9 billion and €15 billion per year, that is, more than the total cost of losses and, undoubtedly, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared to Parliament on Monday, November 14; he added that the 100 days granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve this goal.
"To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government, who delivered his first public address during the opening debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, since "the country's permanence in the euro area" is at stake, he added.
Accordingly, Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects further austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with members of his New Democracy party.
He noted that he agreed with the targets of deficit and debt reduction, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties’ support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
Expert Committee Says Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide Must Be Legalized
Canadians live denying death, Royal Society of Canada report says
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Canadian society denies death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they wish to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient considers such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
For starters, experts cite a recent poll by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death."
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded by Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that did not agree with the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are incompetent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
“In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia, since they believe it would allow people whose death is about to alleviate their suffering, according to a survey by Angus Reid in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or discontinuation of health care for a patient, the situation is not as clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among its recommendations, it is suggested that it should be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses end-of-life care without fear of facing a complaint.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered as euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of the experts signing the report as "extreme", inter alia because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years of age can ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that “in society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, calling it a “manifesto in favor of euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, calls into question especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordanian king urges Assad to step down
Damascus denounces “conspiracy”
Syria is increasingly isolated
Partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a “conspiracy” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, have spoken out in favour of President Assad’s abandonment of power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar al-Assad to “give up power” in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime’s forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
The head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts Turkey has been making since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
Following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the “strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime”.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking on an increasingly harsh tone” regarding the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already been killed in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSHR) has announced.
Two other civilians have died "during bombardments and heavy machine gun shootings in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country was “moving towards the end of the crisis.”
In addition, it has reacted firmly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his duties, which in his opinion constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not weaken,” he added, assuring that “conspiracies plotted against Syria will fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which he believes is locked in “paranoia”.
A further extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to prepare the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday said the decision by the Arab League was “incorrect” while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.

Monti calls for time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future Italian head of government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time from the markets to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated with political parties yesterday and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a wide-ranging programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the appointed President of the Council.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation, by Mr Monti, of a limited list, undoubtedly of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In “democracy, there are precise deadlines” for forming a government and preparing its program, he stressed, adding that he is “sure that the markets will have patience and understand it.”
His appointment by the President initially gained market appreciation, but afterwards the concern was imposed, in particular following an unforeseen drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has highlighted that he would like to include “politicians.”
The new government is expected to run until 2013, the date of the next legislature, he considers.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence of Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work with the urgency in mind and with the aim of Italy "regaining its protagonism" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: “Even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary.”
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a balanced budget in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further stringent measures.
The head of Italian "heads" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow can not meet the deficit requirements."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconismo"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place some 200 billion euros in state bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the researcher’s identification, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed its "serious concern" over a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
He is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are “clear indications that Iran is developing” a nuclear detonation system “with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as one member state has reported to the Agency, worked for most of his career in such technology in the military nuclear program of his home country.”
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, over the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall 14 per cent increase in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 percent are due to racial differences and 20 percent to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that such crimes and crimes have again escalated,” Human Rights First said, “the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant,” the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, an official at the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should endeavour to end such abuses,” he adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports of “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of the civil rights struggle.
Such legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" allow you to more readily and live track the activity of other "Twitters", that is, those internet users whose messages ("tweets") are still on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if they track messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they rate a message as a favorite, etc.
Twitter's new formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before it was released to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another persona, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users have debated the interest of this innovation with tweets with different opinions.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 writes.
“The Activity feature is going to help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream,” <0x40>dannykronstrom writes.
Austrian
Introducing a “golden rule” in the Constitution
The ruling Austrian Social-Democratic/Christian-Democratic government decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "golden rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure far above the ceiling of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay €3 billion more in interest each year,” said Deputy Democrat Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law of equivalent value.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the federal state’s structural government deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the record highs produced by the intervention of the Japanese authorities on October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been rising steadily since then, driven by investor purchases that see it as a “safe haven value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar traded again on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those triggered by the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, since it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the revenues obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the northeastern Tohoku region, said Noda, who fears that the yen's rising price will cut the weak recovery.
The world’s third-largest economic powerhouse has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect "Japan's economic bases."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “appropriate measures,” implying that further monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five trillion yen (€47 billion), bringing to the 55 trillion yen (€519 billion) threshold of funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the guys grow, the bags fade
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weakest countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro area, European stocks are plunging a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 o’clock, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"Given the new tensions in relation to the lending yields of the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to yield part of their recent gains."
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a 0.7% fall, renewing concerns from market players regarding Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye on Europe and exchanges will continue to take place within a narrow margin of variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of concerns about the future of the euro area is affecting the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is still at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that envisages, in particular, the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
The credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, Italian 10-year bond yields reached 6.85%, while Spanish 10-year bonds offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for time from the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which risks being suffocated by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while on Sunday the legislative elections will be held there.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new historic high.
Waiting for growth figures in the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which is more favorable than the forecast 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
The INSEE, however, has revised down the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must be worth more than dogmas.
If there is one issue that cannot be addressed with short-term considerations or simply emotions in mind, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting be a time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The discussion will be useful only if it considers the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will double electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated to continue to produce electricity continuously, not to mention the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case either in Belgium, which places its own under the necessity of finding a source capable of replacing it, or in Switzerland, which aims solely at building state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming construction of a power plant interrupted after the crash of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such a discourse.
The Berlin election will mean an increase in the price of electricity, a greater dependence on energy due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal power plants.
In a few months, the detrimental effects will be noticed.
The case of Denmark must be meditated.
European champion in the wind sector, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistent nature of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear power would imply a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would diminish realism to the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express principled opposition to this type of energy, according to surveys.
Let us remember that our country’s energy policy has lost its ability to build an industrial sector with 125,000 managerial jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and which can create non-deflectable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of those SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three major accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not have consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to reactor design and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two unprecedented natural disasters that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all the electric actors who want to build a plant are studying it, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF competitors, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figures policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Interior Minister (see the May 23 Libération newspaper) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take over all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and right shared fears of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande limits himself to including banality, indicating that co-development will solve the “migration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps profitable electorally, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in immigrant countries.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and hurts employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that immigrants can replace national workers, particularly low-skilled workers, by pushing for lower wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are rather complementary than substitutes for national workers and are primarily engaged in occupations in sectors where there is a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country lacking anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of nationals to have a positive impact on national wages and employment.
In light of the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1% in migration flows represents a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average throughout his or her lifetime.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go and look for the growth points that he lacked "with his teeth".
Those teeth, which dissuaded immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this since, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that for democracy to triumph over its enemies, it would suffice to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little One", that this was something thought out.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an “instrument of oppression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot used to say.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be reflected on in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now been displaced and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and disorderly.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a halt to the void of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take blows of effect, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time on a European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that falls under the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, the one that suffers from its helplessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers a humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it leads to disaster.
Having fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors for a long time, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But to think of it without further political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new impasse.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
Interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let’s make it European.
Cards with "contactless" chip are generalized
The world chip card show kicks off on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, the year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for joint transport or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to continue to increase in 2012 (estimated 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market for chip cards (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payments sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To get the upper gear, however, it is necessary for the banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two major French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminating contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Payment
But it is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is indispensable for transactions.
"They're slowing down."
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and partners will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that will allow its customers to pay contactless through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the long suspected Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers “already has certainty.”
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show they are cooperating," he said, without giving further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the runways.
Kidnapped at a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the debris of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The study of the calls made points to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly caught the interest of investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a northern Nigerian city, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but we must certainly wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "supports" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex suicide bombers or explosive devices in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group as a community of illuminated people not worthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin") incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the partnership is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for Sharia law, while its militants launch into the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are oriented primarily to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations increased.
Abuya’s reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested while alive, is sentenced to death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern feuds.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that caused 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram re-attacked Abuya, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, ranging from Mauritania to Somalia and Nigeria, is a concern for all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information.”
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think it is.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making increasingly loud statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strength of Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the "Grand Old Party" designation, has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulation of their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that implies the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated outlook on foreign policy, nearly drowns in an attitude that “captures” emotions.
He has called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also pledged military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he boasted.
“If Obama gets re-elected, they’ll get the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second highest ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, it urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop nuclear capability,” apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an aficionado and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty exit of the “boys” from Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population judges rather positively Obama’s national security balance, which ended Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is suspicious of the military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
The Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of Nord Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and her Netherlands counterpart Mark Rutte have together turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will reach Western Europe every year through a first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 to supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, it is already talked about the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents an air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has achieved greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, given that the project has created a gap between East and West Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically,” Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which major contracts in the gas sector are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to take extreme measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Swedish waters, but those responsible for the project renounced it as they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state-owned company to settle permanently at sea off their shores.
"In case of a breakdown, we will stop the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, since they have predicted junctions that, according to forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, carried by a vessel, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, in charge of building and operating the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire gas transmission capacity to the company for a renewable period of twenty-five years.
“Gazprom will pay for the full capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the project is expected to reach €7.4 billion for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of expenses.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, with a height of 4.5 meters, form the exit gate of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people a taste for writing back.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged over time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted an old and forgotten object to today's taste, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far away is the confidential production of the early years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which had twelve employees in its beginnings, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a leopard tapas notebook on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled doubles the average rate: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Discouraging?
“No,” says Eric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable.
At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
“However, there is still a lot to be done.”
It should be noted that the disabled unemployed continue to face numerous barriers to accessing employment.
They usually have an older age: 37% are over 50 years old (on average 17%).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% have not finished high school and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In other words, there are numerous issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the heart of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Managing Director of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; people’s mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entrepreneur for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal set in a 1987 law.
According to the latest figures available, dating from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
“We now reach around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The test: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created great pressure for companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with 20 to 49 employees have disabled employees, compared with 82 per cent of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "A Joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly brings them.
We dare not say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the auditorium stand of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have truly made peace.
Five months after his striker’s gesture of resentment against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and because she is Belgian."
“I want to move forward,” the Lille striker replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations on his team and in the selection, "it is a set", it has been justified.
“In Lille, I’m all year round, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brighten".
Not to mention the “pleasure.”
He has been cheering the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been your fan,” he says.
Undoubtedly, this will especially reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he remembers.
“We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to “pride.”
"Pride" for playing "a gala game."
“I’m proud” also to verify, as a “neighbor,” that France “returns to be a very high-level team,” about a year after Knysna’s trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus to... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"They will be able to see him in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal Shows Great Confidence
Paulo Bento’s Portugal faces with great optimism the return match against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked realism.
“After these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; the Selection, which he has led since September 2010, is going to qualify for the Euro 2012.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is one game to play and one rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the one-way (0-0) game on Friday in Zenica hell, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given him peace of mind.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t scored away from home.”
But at home, in the luminous Estadio de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be just as enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal", says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the game will be very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroz's successor said.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a tie, although they also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t scored away from home,” said Bento.
“We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not leave them time to think".
It’s a good idea, as long as it’s realistic this time.
