Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, total they come to 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the large coalition so far and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought, after the first preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the decline.
In contrast, the head of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian state captain Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but compared to the last elections in 2006, it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse, the ÖVP lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially with the People’s Party, which had called for the early elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
But voters have probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers think this could be the case as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
Given the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received provisionally 18%, the BZÖ 11% of the vote - the Social Democrats expressed at the same time their fear that the year 1999 could repeat itself, when the People's Party had agreements with the populists (at the time the FPÖ was still united), which had split from the European Union in 2005.
This development is obviously Jörg Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with each party and assumes a return to Vienna in Austrian federal politics.
The Green Party also entered the parliament, but suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent hurdle and therefore did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If we fail to resolve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India of unlawful gathering of beetles, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister in New York stressed this after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not cleared up, then surely, there will be some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
In spite of all this, he indicated that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine, the central government wanted to join the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi believes that it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
He could thus ask for release on bail and wait in liberty for his judgment, according to the minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same in the negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole affair is to have the convicted “competent legal support” flourish, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said such assistance was already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, the Czech press agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of its partner, reaffirmed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really think it is a big mistake to imprison and indict these Czech scientists,” he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had received a pledge from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister quit.
“I’ve been promised a lot,” he said.
A Czech runs over the wrestling around the seabed
It comes to an electronic map that shows Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member staff of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
Its head, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it to and from.
This is where work and enthusiasm prevail.
The sea floor is home to a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Petroleum, ore and other non-renewable raw materials, as well as previously unknown living organisms, can be found here, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The neighbouring states today vehemently declared their entitlement to the new sea areas.
According to a UN convention, they are exercising their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometers from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
Simply put, the continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its soles that represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded,” Mikulka adds.
An international echo recently struck the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly enlarge its maritime areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed, which was granted to the country by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, or about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profits they will receive from the use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the “Montego Bay Agreement.”
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the Convention as the "common heritage of humanity".
There is no longer a state that has a special position.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor is not a gold digger land," Mikulka said, adding that "the individual areas of which are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Category: Czechoslovakia in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it was awarded the status of a "breakthrough investor" by the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states.
The organization has the right to promote ClarionClipperton in the Silent Ocean zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea floor.
"You can support it on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said another jurist, Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such a concretion as a sample.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the legendary scheme that brought the golem to life.
German Special Forces were on site at Geiselbefreiung
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special forces were ready, but they did not come to use.
More and more details are becoming known about the liberation of eleven kidnapped European tourists in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the pilot squad of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Works were at the place of liberation.
The German forces were not needed, however, because the hostage-takers let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to include them as support forces on the ground.
“Fortunately, this has not happened,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and her eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been dragged back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin about when they would return to Germany.
According to Bild-Zeitung, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has barely failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones roared into the depths.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on MPs to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones collapsed by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason was investors’ concerns that the state bailout package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after becoming aware of the failure, crashed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary for the programme to enter into force.
Organizers record rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even for the winter season by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, according to one study, the Germans’ travel pleasure remains untroubled.
In terms of bookings for the winter season, the rice offices recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking numbers for the autumn months.
For example, the increase in sales of travel agencies for October amounted to around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
These results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies and calculates them for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, travel to the United States is particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the increase in bookings amounts to about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local countryside, are particularly sought after destinations among the Germans.
In particular, package trips would be on the right track, DRV President Klaus Laepple said.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs are "better calculable for the customer than for individually organised holidays".
Consumers could save money, among other things, through early-booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that sales will increase again compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liter jugs and celebrities in designer dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV host and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes on the meadow, the photographers rush on us and snap the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap-dirndl seems to serve its purpose.
As a resident of Wiesn-Touri, and actually north of the white sausage quadrant, the feeling of well-being in the costume remained limited until now.
But once we arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reap my dirndl apron.
One Munich woman reminds me that I had tied the apron incorrectly: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, widowed in the back."
I secretly crawl the loop from the back to the left.
"It's okay," she said and laughed.
Others make less effort for subtle flirtation techniques, wearing simple felt hats with "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretching the naked back towards an uninvited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is named Bob, who comes from England and also attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long "oooooo".
He tells me this after getting rid of his previously drunken measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wildbies".
Others are not fortunate enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At around eight o’clock in the evening, paramedics walk in crowds across the square, who have to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always show up in a pack - always four at a time tow a covered carrier from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty, fully back.
You can't see who's under the tarpaulin in the promille coffin.
"These are where goarnimmers are grabbing," one of the paramedics called to me on request and disappeared in the hustle and bustle.
Name of the victim of the accident announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been announced.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of insane driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inside Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner of the front and looks like any provincial German Town Hall.
The rock is dirty.
The entire building is decaying.
But once you’re inside the domed ticket counter, there’s no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a delay in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperialist plans were paralyzed during the First World War.
His rails were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt, pushing the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train of ammunition flew into the air, destroying the artful roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly decayed, largely bypassed by history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it, to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a voluntarily new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from neighbouring regions, generated by the Cold War borders, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splitter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading ACP foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the step of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new secular state project, to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has sparked a lot of suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a specially crafted, ultra-modern stone and steel structure, in an evolving suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
“The objective of the Party’s foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exceptional event,” he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, it has to look east and west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
She would have to do both.
“But surely Turkey could at some point,” I asked, “be forced to decide?”
"Turkey," he said, "would not have to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that Europe as a whole can, in a transfigured sense, travel eastwards on the same railroad tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha’s station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now be in the hands of Turkey, to a large extent.
And as I waited at the dock for the ferry to take me back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time, at least, there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for teenagers up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979 some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting and lasted only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never gave up for years.
How often did death stop us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
Sing it!"
His manner of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never masterful but never overwhelming.
Whatever the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to become a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, during which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic.
For the past 40 years or so, I’ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by a single person—often I’ve been inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of size and personal humility.
He hated conductors who, according to him, simply "go home with one or two well-known showhorses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while studying at the same time for a BSc, an MA and a PhD degree.
This is a conclusion from an author’s remark in Woodruff’s book “Beyond Nab End,” but it’s not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham permanently and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
<0x60>I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino <0x60>Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and because of the strength they radiate, how they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.

Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large-scale sedan offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical details that allow even more comfortable driving and saving gasoline.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this grand sedan are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
However, before you start analyzing the new model, it has to be said that this new jazz will appear six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon when it comes to its sale in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After the jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
In more detail, the launch of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales decline in Spain.
In reality, the heads of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sales of 22,000 models, which is 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% year-on-year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is relying on the launch of a new model.
It is Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed across the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight is scheduled to appear on the market for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
In terms of the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due on the one hand to the new space flexibility program and on the other hand to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous model of Jazz.
The capacity of the luggage compartment, which has a system of double loading area, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation luggage compartment.
It must be emphasized that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4-litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, other than the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The second generation of jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first 1.2-litre variant achieves 90 hp at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min?1.
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
In terms of the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
‘Auto-bee’ that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight stems from the swarming behavior of bees and prevents accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, head of technology PR and R&D brand management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is meant to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the bee’s faceted eyes, which can see at an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows her to fly undisturbed in her personal airspace without interruption.
In order to replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notices obstacles up to two meters apart in front of the BR23C and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor, which is immediately translated into a collision avoidance signal.
At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the little robot will mimic the bee flight and immediately change direction by rotating its wheels by 90o or even greater angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this evasion manoeuvre takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it weren’t, the robot might not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory of Mobility and the project’s senior engineer.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, but it cannot move overhead; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways as bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, Nissan has used the rotation function to help the small robot avoid collisions.
This device only takes a couple of seconds to process the information and act on it.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers performed, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozens of KB of storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan is predicting to introduce to serial boats over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to guide you to your destination while driving, while avoiding obstacles along the way.
She's on trembling before she gets charged with a mortgage.
It must be understood that the U.S. Department of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid getting U.S. citizens involved in mortgage histories of supposedly payable banks, a fun and informative game for internet surfers was developed: ‘Bad Credit Hotel’, it is said.
Or maybe, the 'hotel of bad credits' or of mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation, and especially its receptionist, is to think one, two, and up to three times, whether it is time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is also probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a site for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen if the game is extended?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley provides its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a sharp fall in its stock market price.
A week after a preliminary settlement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s common shares at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is less than 19% of the price of the share as of August 31st.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares that will secure it a 10% profit and can be sold back at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be done on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, which is 28% above the current price.
Morgan Stanley's share, however, fell 6.79% to $23.07 at 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to holding bank status,” said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which is meant to allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities unveiled on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the past few days: Last Monday Morgan had simply stated that she would sell up to 20% of her shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, in Tokyo, “we thought that the stake would consist entirely of ordinary shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.”
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below their price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go on with a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares if the latter is exchanged within a given period to more than 50% above the sale value, that is to say to about $47.
Morgan Stanley assured that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, a spokesman for the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a payability rate of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had "significantly" lowered his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been hard for the group to watch as their stock market price dropped by half as the price of insolvency insurance soared.
This price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivors” of the major investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The re-establishment of the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his like-minded people and friends, it was the third one who put forth the plan for a new constitution.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results of 80% of the voters, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'No', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were submitted empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, more than half of all votes cast must be voted.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exits of the polling stations and a census of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for "yes" and prophesied to him 63% to 70%.
By the way, on the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional draft.
The “constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way,” he had insured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence under the Organization of American States (OAS) Observation Board, referred to a text consisting of 444 points to safeguard the <0x60>new socialism', which the President advocates.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to ‘development planning’ in a country that largely lives on oil production by foreign companies and the foreign exchange that sends emigrants into the country.
The project, driven by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the head of state more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also safeguards the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Ultimately, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad.
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were returned to the Egyptian capital in a healthy and intact manner this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they had been liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached al-Maza military base right next to Cairo’s international airport at around 3.30pm aboard a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, for investigation there.
They all enjoyed “best health” and the kidnappers “were not paid a ransom,” Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said on the field.
After being captured on September 19 during an off-road vehicle safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hideout to the next by 35 unknown hijackers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the Special Forces, on board two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
"Shots fell on both sides and half of the hijackers were killed, the rest fled," said the official, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 Egyptian special forces had been dispatched to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is now, about the role, the secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces have played.
“We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence and special forces,” he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The day before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle in a patrol, in which the hijackers were located, of which they killed six, including the leader from Chad, and arrested two.
The army stated that they were connected to a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Sudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, but immediately denied that movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical sites that are sadly starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally important structures?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing €3.5 million solely for the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors, the constitution of their country states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all members of parliament and all districts of government, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, the Association of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 historical societies, are striving to deal intensively with history, to save a few pennies of the numerous private archives, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the power of despair when promoters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux states want to arm the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has become turbulent due to the US financial crisis: the three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary, by the way.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level discussions this weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission Competition Authority representative.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has lasted for a year, so decisions that are now being made in connection with the bank could have a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank for about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell part of its stakes, especially the insurance activities acquired by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis began a steep descent last week, with serious crisis scenarios already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too big for a bankruptcy.
The institute’s securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the Group’s market value is EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic according to the management.
According to the management, the $700 billion U.S. bailout package and the resulting market uncertainty is to blame for the downturn of Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the Bank’s new Managing Director.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find an interested party with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
So far, there has been no panic among the customers, and the bank’s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also names its own leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
Because of a person’s drug use, in America, life and health insurance often refuse to make a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are privacy programs that match the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the affected person.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the fox to the chickens," said Richard Dick, developer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies determine the fees and payout amounts in the event of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and if the risk is overestimated, the insurance will not be concluded at all.
Previously, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was only concluded with the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much more favorable method: Using the customer’s identification number, he obtains the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, that is, which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it can be concluded that his blood fat levels are untreatable, which would automatically rank him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance companies only have to do the paperwork anymore, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the drawbacks is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as for migraines and hot flashes, but also for depression.
The latter is, from the insurers’ point of view, a high-risk factor, while those mentioned before are not.
For the query and processing of the data, their own companies have formed, which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and link them to the data on drug use to provide an even more accurate picture of patients’ health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and at the same time controlling its use becomes more difficult.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, under which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be shared with the consent of the affected person.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prevent access to his or her data, as otherwise the insurance companies do not conclude a contract with him or her.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global menu from Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling trade
As the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, this was the main theme of the Ninth Summit, along with other global issues.
The French-Indian summit is also taking place today, where cooperation in the nuclear energy sector is mainly discussed.
While the European Union recognizes that India is an emerging, democratic great power that should be given more voice and voice in international concerns, the Member States have so far not been able to agree on whether or not to support New Delhi's permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase to more than 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that aviation will also be boosted in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the EU by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India’s number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked nineth among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, which means that pollutant emissions are to be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed to this, as well as the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be tackled, which is why both support the convening of an international conference on the subject of the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, contracts to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India are expected.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair will be attended by more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will be distributed over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The Under-Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition hall "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, numbers, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is decreasing throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's small plane found missing a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire disappeared on a flight over the Nevada Desert on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a 3000 m high plateau, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the aircraft.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely blurred the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane was located, where a force was sent, and now we are certain that it was the plane that Steve Fossett flew with on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Office of Traffic Safety (NTSB) noted that just hours after sighting the aircraft, a crew was sent to identify the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett took off on a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of Fossett’s personal belongings were found in California, near the border with Nevada, from a couple near their home at Mammoth Lakes.
These are two ID cards named Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned himself a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, in his sixth run, he became the first person to orbit the world balloon in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single non-stop flight with an airplane.
Among his several records is also a 15445 m high flight over the Andes, this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that, thanks to its original design and the special lines, the expansive surface and its clear angles, falls out of the traditional schemes.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector with this off-roader.
Due to its exceptional characteristics, the presentation of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
The advertising drum, which will accompany the release of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in various phases that will occupy the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so apparently from the poster on which it is pictured.
With the help of Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated at different moments in all its details to reassemble as a whole.
Undoubtedly, it is Mercedes’ concern with this advertising to introduce a new kind of automobile advertising into this rather stereotyped field.
But will this succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the Italian national team for years and, honestly, until recently, has not caused any serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right milieu.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, there were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: but these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, it now clashed with a truly right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc had been provided to the Italian fans 144 cards for the game: all were issued in names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those who traveled to Sofia was no one with an ongoing banning process.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this regard, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified in the riots Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitators who could follow them a little more than 150.
"This fire must be fired immediately, and that in no case gives such behavior the possibility of justification," the Viminal said.
Therefore, "eyes on above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of Italian ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sports supervision) will gather, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deals with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce cries and raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took the post of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police chief of Trieste, where now a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, comes from.
While it is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, the behavior of these 150-200 people was undoubtedly a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds No. 1 of the Osservatorio, “crimes are being punished in the country of their deeds.
So far, this group had been in control, but now it is necessary to rethink what has happened and what will happen.
But let us also talk about the whistles during the anthem of Mameli: this is not a crime, but they allow me, because there is no education."
