The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday's fall when it fell to about 6%.
The decline this time is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
Here, too, is the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the financial sector secretary's stabilization plan.
Stocks falling in Asia
Asian stocks saw a dramatic drop on Tuesday, though over the course of the day the index finally eased some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index throughout its financial day scored nearly four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The bailouts planned in the U.S. are insecure and this affects the financial market around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Mint.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, i.e. without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system to which $700 billion should be devoted (nearly 12 trillion kronor).
Legislators, in that way, ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloody slump and mostly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to nearly seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index dropped before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal was not moving forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: U.S. Government May Inject $700 Billion into Banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial assistance to the American financial system.
The vote will take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers sparked a gap in talks on approving the bailout plan in its form to help the U.S. financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and before it is voted on.
The financial system aid plan will be discussed Monday at the Assembly of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Assembly’s Committee on Financial Services and Banking, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could take place in the Senate no later than Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the bailout plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Afterwards, however, "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market support will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a big breakthrough.
We have resolved our disagreements regarding the shape of the package of measures to stabilize the market,” Democrat Nancy Pelosia told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with finance minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive shape to the government Fund.
This should buy from financial corporations unsold mortgage assets that lead financial corporations to severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and should also be effective in the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already in it," Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis is explicitly affecting the rapidly declining stock market.
According to Democratic Senator for Nevada, Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything in their power to get Congress to definitively approve a deal on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors’ business in the face of the Asian finance market as these are the ones in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now, there is nothing clear with certainty about when the two chambers of Congress will vote and even if they will not stagnate at the last moment with any problem.
Legislators believe it will be passed in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another $100 billion and later the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president may veto this decision but Congress may surpass his veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to gain financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to finish paying off their mortgages.
“We’ve worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
Its spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is pleased with Saturday's move and that he appreciates "the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of armored contract
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the head of the negotiators, said lawmakers decided on the responsibility of the money from the program to protect taxpayers from their losses, a relieving closure of the planned finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the participating companies of the program, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it, and we’ve made great strides toward the agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree on the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly charges of debtors’ installment payments and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but rather difficult.
“And that’s why you don’t know with what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of the losses between the financial sector and the government,” Marek said this week, to the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
“Much more importantly, this week the congressmen will agree on their support and give them their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to reach that approval is, at the moment, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Armed hand fight: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player gets to make calls.
Which seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are sufficient reasons for man to acquire only the reproductor.
The choice depends practically on the way of its use and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the other hand, these kinds of music products such as LP records are no longer released, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music crawl on your shelves, you’re probably dreaming at least of this type of record player.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, that is, the compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the flea helmets from twenty crowns.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life
Some of the best players do much more than just play music and even what not even most mobiles do.
No device today is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most elementary functions such as calling, sending messages, it can play music and video, record both, has a better or worse camera and can even navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDAs they will also have in their pocket a small computer.
This is a small miracle as no refrigerator knows how to make a grill and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the mobile phone, the sooner the display indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And the reproduction of music is one of the biggest energy tragons.
Few mobile phones manage to play music more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top of that, they constantly call themselves still, for greater safety, a charger for work - this is also valid for the more expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, because even the worst can withstand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices have the universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only on some reader drives without reduction the small memory cards that are used on mobiles can be connected.
In players, with some exceptions (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music via the USB of the computer.
Most mobile phones and players create their order in the music library alone according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment be interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the convenience of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to the music as a background and will listen to it every day only for a while, as on the tram, then it is enough with any mobile you play.
That’s what virtually any mobile device gets.
It should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player plays the music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and almost all the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough via the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service could in itself be a weighty argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is miserable and most are limited only to the topics of fleeting success of the radios.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least handsfree ones.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
For most of you it will limit the absence of an entry for classic headphones.
The best, even as far as the technical part is concerned, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest ones (see our selection) - really handle them by anyone.
The minimal functions, its handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the record players is evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with mobile and, consequently, gigantic data download account.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card it will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have an 8GB memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) no more than 1,100 crowns need to be spent.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding music lovers, use the most specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles of the Walkman line have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, about four thousand crowns, but with a greater capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the aforementioned brand more arria brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not going to be long before it arrives.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming rate regulation it will probably come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS sending from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that really wants to fight.
Probably this seems paradoxical, since we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), said that there is no longer room for any other operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be quite difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant price drop to which also the classic operators had to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, similar voices were heard both here and there.
It has been proven that there is room for this type of operators and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, there is no need to look too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to attract more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the group Penta which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to concentrate on many more specific target groups.
In addition, for them to be able to operate effectively, they have far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not involve relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of virtual operators typically profile themselves at low costs - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that, however, often counteract the tighter service offering.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half cheap compared to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, the bet on a nothing trivial goal group can also be a good blow.
This operator is specifically aimed at the man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – he’s the operator he likes and who can be trusted,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works with this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if similar concept like that of Poland could hook in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epický said: “The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the service offering it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be some virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it doesn’t seem too hopeful.
Rather, it’s about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region,” Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, said in a telephone conversation for mobile.cz.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile phone services.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to move forward in the meetings,” said the group’s spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe better times are flashing.
It seems that, for unofficial information, the first official operator would likely have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional conformity with O2's opinion, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop."
“In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that would be possible to study in such a short horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this with regard to the allocation of expenses and infrastructure.
We consider it to be the biggest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field is to partner with which to establish a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a fall in prices and thus a fall in profits.
So why make it easier to enter the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the company T-Mobile.
This is attested by the public information available on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: "In addition, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
As far as the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean great demands for him and, above all, for his services.
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously daunting due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in trade tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position on this problem.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement was concluded on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator.
To date no agreement has been concluded since the offer of potential stakeholders was rather not interesting enough for classic operators," added Kristian Chalupa, of the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers it is more than a consideration, besides they should note that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "Overseas where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the lower prices of mobile telephony services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the fall in prices are not in the interest of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Really how dramatically shocking this whole case is in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether this is really a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at the gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of coincidence and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office has found no signs of unfair competition in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore, do not have a corresponding rise in responsibility in their actions in the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators are lacking, as are telecom regulators,” Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is obviously an analysis of relevant markets drawn up by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> according to which telecommunications are, from the point of view of the commercial tender, a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech traders has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS should represent a warning the fact that three mobile operators are moving up strikingly similarly.
The current complaints of the interested parties (included by the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they collide with many similar impediments.
Carrying responsibility on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We have met him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act to extend the competence of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the field of commercial tenders was recently introduced, which was not implemented, even when a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This should be well known to the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, but it is evident that their interests are elsewhere.
Everything's fine, when no one looks
At the same time, it unnoticedly continues to function something like a pseudo-virtual operator that already exists in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile services which, however, only a part are public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
Usually only a few chosen ones get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the carrier, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions at all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases such as those cited were discovered, there could be talk of a breach of the contractual conditions that could result in the end of the collaboration with the given company," Martina Kemrová replied to the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, they can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make not negligible profits and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epický warns us of possible problems: "the law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible as much percent of customers.
These, moreover, must accept that your phone’s SIM card is not in your name so they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal carrier customer.”
This is precisely what should seem to the minimally strange <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
There is also a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile operators are blind in this type of procedure, why are they blocking the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has sufficient competence to discover these types of activities and if it does not want to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decrease in prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually every country where the virtual operator arose, the classic operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this intrusion.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, eventually too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, at the moment the regulatory bodies have intervened and in no case have they defended the operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure they managed to emerge the first virtual operator and with it began to emerge others.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority passes this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of powers in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually gets to these lands, then the Czech mobile market is likely to start moving again.
If any of the operators allow a virtual mobile operator to enter, it will be difficult for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling it more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one to male voice and one to female voice, one with Chorus and another instrumental.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka are responsible for the singing.
The authors of the hymn arrangements are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers this Czech national song as one of the most beautiful anthems.
Czech Radio said earlier that it intentionally chose singers for the Solos with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with both of them and then also with the Choir to fix on the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it was consistent," he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home first sounded in 1834 on the tables of the Theatre of the States in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "New" Anthem Sounds
The MHD Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, the history of the Prague Transport Company writes the date when the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can now be purchased by nearly 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the voucher for 30 days, 90 days and the annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously charge it to their chip card at the transport company's infocenters and stalls at the Metro stations, Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Rozty<0xC4><0x8D>, Let<0xC5><0x88>
The bonds can be purchased as early as yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start forgetting the ticket stands at subway stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to get a regular ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the thirteen subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
"At these locations there is a ready-made staff window at the passengers' disposal that helps interested parties with online purchases and also with the reloading of the purchased voucher on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic voucher on the Opencard in the automatic vending machines that are located in some of the subway lobbys.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket-picking machine and travelers will probably have noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start running tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter in it the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be charged only in it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on bypass trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the towns of Central Bohemia.
“In trains assigned to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the voucher,” explained the ticket control, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that sets the schedules of the public transport of Prague.
The bypass buses have their reading cards mounted on the driver’s ticket office.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany him with the Opencard in the intended place on the side of the box.
The driver controls the validity of the voucher.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not travel on bypass buses and do not remember when the voucher expires can head to the vending machines where the cards are reloaded.
Here, on the machine screen, they will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans called for Fumaba to become part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Southern Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans were presumably addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
It is from the letters that are stored in a particular archive and that today are stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>eský Krumlov request in a letter to the American president that he not allow the return of the "land <0xC5><0xA0>umava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have correctly understood the situation and really want his word that American units are reaching German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators,” the letter reads, signed with a “people carrying the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in their hearts.”
Given that the union of Czechoslovakia with the Southeast Germans presumably assumes - according to these the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors plead in the letter to the American president to assume <0xC5><0xA0>umava for now and forever under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we are delivered to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way contributes to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason the authors cannot sign is presumably fear of reprisals by the “Czech oppressors.”
If the President of the United States presumably doubted this idea of the Germans <0xC5><0xA1>umavos, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the <0xC5><0xA1>umavas lands on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge we have of postwar history, may sound a bit childish, according to some specialists it paints the expectations of the Germans of the Southeast at the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have intuited minimally that their expulsion from the republic was going to be dealt with only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate some clear form of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was in the war, as a German of Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, enrolled in the Baltic navy.
When at the end of the war he was arrested by the British and placed in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that on returning home, the Czech would be a good fit for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected that on the basis of the Decrees of Benes they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office promises to deter drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, film, the internet and in brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high-speed and alcohol driving.
And also to remind them that before getting started, they tie their belts.
It wants to reach the awareness especially of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and finally also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that embed emotions.
And for this we are witnessed by the "blood" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "Don't think" is written with large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This should symbolize that man in a moment of despair can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises that in this way it will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"For drivers it's worth the sugar and whip system.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red traffic light is passed and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says transport psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why an information campaign in the press and mainly negative publicity is needed, the psychologist says.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
Israel’s Provisional Government President Ehud Olmert spoke about the restitution of virtually all the land occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that on Monday appeared in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to return almost all (occupied) lands if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll get a little bit of this land, but we'll have to give it to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he said.
He admitted that in case of restitution East Jerusalem would also be included.
“Whoever wants safety in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, sacred and historical place" that is located inside the ancient city.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won’t work,” he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which, from his point of view, is an inherent condition for concluding a peace deal with Syria.
But this would also require concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to get rid of in order to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with the Hezbollah (Shia movement), they must detach themselves from the ongoing support provoked by the terrorism of Hamas (Shia movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq.
Questions after the accident: Are stewardesses on buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the bus company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises whether the flight attendants and passengers can move by the bus during the trip.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the stewardess' activity is opposed to the road traffic law," Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the vehicle despite having two other places reserved.
However, the bus may have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the exact moment when the stewardess distributes the coffee or newspapers.
The role here is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no standing places to go, which company director Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura confirmed to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was removed and we reached the agreement that passengers can go to the toilet with the bus going if they have a seat," he said.
The stewardess does not know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess - no legal provision clarifies this role.
Even no legal provision prohibits transportation agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term vehicle reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined," said spokesman Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, head of the Department of Road Traffic in the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law addresses this problem sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus has the permit to have walking sites.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided between urban, where there are sites to stand and maximum speed limited, interurban with sites to stand with a higher speed permit and those of long distances without places to stand, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seatbelts.
Like on the plane, says the expert.
The BESIP expert on Transportation Safety, Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, sees no major problems with the movement of the stewardess on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Even here there is no certainty that the turbulence will come and that the stewardess can be hit in the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly brakes obviously that the physical laws are valid.
Same as on a city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewardess must be solved by the internal rules of the carrier," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the service of flight attendants.
It employs two hundred in it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
“However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess position is risky, then I will abolish it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive you, passengers, on entering.
It would even save expenses,” he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks flight attendants in their vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have hostesses, we’re against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
A huge tragedy happened.
In the accident of the line connecting Naples, a young Pilsen flight attendant who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus without using the blinkers.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he collided with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the stewardess' rest were sold.
“These sites cannot be booked for long-distance connections, they are blocked.”
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the girl’s family compensation but expects the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring more precision on the movement of the stewardess on the bus in which for a year thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport are working.
“However, they have not come to any concrete conclusions.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile while on the road," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of flight attendants to be something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, concluding that the safety control of buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
The hope of Dusseldorf is based in Frankfurt
In the letter from the board of directors of the West LB bank to its employees there are no shortages of big words.
By merging the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank can form <0x60>a central capital market of the financial group of Sparkassen', as the paper says, published on Monday
West LB bank, breaking the ‘competition block’ with sustainable profitability would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for subsequent regional bank mergers.
This is how he gets to understand the text, when a board of directors wants to show ability to act in hard times.
Because as before the West LB is under tremendous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the part of the Federal Institute for the Surveillance of Financial Services, which has recently made clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the Frankfurt side, there has been a lot of talk about the union of this kind between DEKA bank, which the customers of Sparkasse know by its investment funds, and West LB.
In truth, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, said he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the board of directors of DEKA, which now consists of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board of directors to start negotiations with West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, as it is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen sector, the name of the DEKA bank appears, which with its 3,000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs at the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003, at one point, the situation seemed that DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian government spoke out against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But the idea of DEKA merging with other regional banks was always played out again.
But finally, Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba board of directors, said he was against plans to coexist with his bank.
Regardless of that it seems clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
For, when the Bavarian parliamentary elections pass, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to rise, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it has excelled much better from the financial crisis than the properties of Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, earlier this year avoided plans for coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, there is only the Nord LB.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end, you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, isn’t the bank’s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the whole bank.
As you can combine the coexistence between singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that will show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena is assisting him as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser-brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants what low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 leave three buses, <0x60>direction Munich, the beer party', foreseeable arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are mainly planned for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already begun to party at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver studs, owns these buses.
For five years they have come to the Oktoberfest, considering that this year alone there are three excursions.
At night on the road over there, during the day in the meadow, at 10.30 p.m. the lap.
Spending the night there means just unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian law of purity, health insurance and guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the motorway with the direction "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Quickly the tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are asleep.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
They stop at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates take another break on Highway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group has the scheduled arrival at 6.30 in the parking lot next to Teresa’s Prado, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to it is the website of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the tent of the camp open, that means marching!" cries Marco in the early morning.
"March!" March and occupy the back sites in the tent of the campaign.
“Don’t take the places in front, because we’re going to block, and everyone in yellow caps don’t sit on the same bench, scattered all over the space!”
A liter of beer, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
He's just getting out of his place, he's already busy!"
Third: "Exactly at 10:30 this afternoon you have to get here!"
And now everyone is going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, tie the yellow caps on the trees, road signs and even on a poster of the elections of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
We want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second Oktoberfest weekend that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no exact data on the number of people; it is about 50,000 people making the trip over the Alps and stormy entering the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The police in Munich receive help from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, ahead of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The Italians’ favourite campaign tent is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück said last week.
Well, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sphere will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich’s DAX-listed real estate financier, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to resist market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to throw interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as from public law banks.
The cause of that is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a short period - which now, due to distrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank's cash capital reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of equity lagged slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continued income from financial investments and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero, imputation revenues for debtors and some securities also those of dissolution of lending business provisions tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues from the reimbursements of the restructuring expenses of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and organized businesses for the consortium’s companies, the negative balance could show a deficit of about 16 percent more.
After his privatization in 1990 the former state financier was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as the reason for the founding of Aareal bank.
As there was little money to be earned from financing state projects, the Defa began to devote intensively to infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated profit and loss account of the group, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they were cancelled at two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became a major state finance and financial in the field of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not have customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year Hypo Real Estate needs nearly €50 billion to finance a portion of Defa’s credit portfolios from its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for the group’s financing for a short time and the company is assured of “the influence of international money markets that are now essentially unfit to operate”
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
That’s what the bank’s shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis, there is no record.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be ruled out.
There was a voice that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary salvation cannot at least reassure people concerned.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts hardly change, borrowing rates depending on the position on the property record clearly tend to decline.
Affecting are mainly the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and rightly the loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the notable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of their loans, which were previously an investment for speculation, must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start with the amortization of pensions on time.
Or something is going to happen, which no one can imagine – the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial statehood, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights sleepless, breaking their heads over the decision on their isolation from enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put the endpoint and use the transport to new account of the losses for forthcoming profit compensation tax payments on the change in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana High School, the girls began to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she counts Japan.
"The first day in a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go by train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
Alone I had to find the way, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not as rigorously fixed as in my home in Lower Saxony.
From eight o’clock in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty a small meeting with the teachers begins, the ‘home room’.
Before class began, I had to introduce myself.
I am also not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt from the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
For, dressed like this, I put myself at the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this time I was very happy because I had already started studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and waved and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my sleeves.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "monkey, cute"
Then I swiftly slid into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
They all spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions- at the same time it is very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
Then at the recess they all pulled out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and something like mass tofu meat.
In most cases I have no idea what I like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in hopes of getting to know him better during a recess.
I read about that in my Manga-Comics.
I'm really curious to see if I can see it here too.
“Why exactly Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
For years, I’ve been reading Manga.
To better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a skinny by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is a harsh, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here although Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or cockroach feeling danger runs away, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can one control whether they, behaving like us, feel the same way?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include the questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as other animals: it makes the dead, runs away or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, as some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to spread our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short memory and the executive functions that direct behavior).
This large part is much more developed in the case of humans than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects related to our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is united with the language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it were, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is neither allowed to be measured because it has the special hardware, nor is analyzed through our experiences, so his research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions relate to the content of the consent experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
One could investigate the consciousness processes of animals without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during the short-memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing passes rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two may or may not be similar.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for visualization formation.
And what does that mean for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain that is responsible for that is activated, as is the case with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when brain activity occupies a space in the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed to part of the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the other hand, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for body feelings and the brain stem, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, perhaps that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same way?
Seeing the danger a cockroach runs away, because it's afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of the behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That’s true that neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brainstems, cockroaches on the contrary don’t have at least one brain.
Is it the brain stem that is responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I would rather investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally distinguished from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and the language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as long as the same is measured for rats and men.
Since I do not investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It can be said that I don’t see beyond my noses, but I’d rather move forward than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
The President of UEFA Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said the preparations would soon take place under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a confidence test of Ukraine's ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“But that’s not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is a lot to do in both countries.”
The schedule for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
The number of stadiums is likely to be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
Now we have to carry out work at great speed," said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"Uefa will not take our eyes off."
In Poland, a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is “a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules,” Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
“In a letter we have assured the President of UEFA Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that.”
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were convicted because of manipulation down to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's indignant counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life — and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses on Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid’s ex-couple: Eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show off an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The motive for the disclosure of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - it tells a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to the designation of him as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is “unheard of how often Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old told New York Daily News.
Among other things, it’s very “regrettable” that Jack, his 16-year-old son, is again “going to publicly remember the pain and changes, all of which means a divorce for a child.”
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently is a twin papa.
And so he ends with his statements emphasizing: "However my life goes on.
I’m happy because I have a wonderful family that’s fine.”
Airline and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a recent study, airline tickets in Germany became cheap even as much as 50 percent.
Airline tickets and hotel overnight stays became cheap again - these are the results of a study by American Express's travel and financial services provider.
The company has analyzed its first-half 2008 booking data and after rising prices in the first quarter saw a big change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, prices in 41 of Europe’s 48 different cities rose on average to 6.9 per hundred between January and March.
From April to June, prices have already dropped to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar price, which was the cause that "American tourists' interest in traveling declined."
The decline in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent, setting a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Due to rising kerosene prices, Economy travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, airfare prices in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the change in prices was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February, prices rose to 11.9, and in the second half fell to 23.6 percent.
According to a study, prices for domestic flights in Germany have even halved.
The cause of the price change is partly the rise in the loose economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes air traffic between the U.S. and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit distance flights on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
Borussia's Luhukay to him still does not go out to make the eleventh goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
The player from Gladbach started playing late and failed by making a goal.
Everything he meant exactly reacting to what happened, he could read clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
“We need a second goal,” Hermann Rieger whistled at the cockpit entrance to the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were back at their sites.
Rieger was an HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades, enjoying a very high reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded with his head and raised his fingers in assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not accomplished.
“Today it wasn’t all nice to see,” added Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard also wished he had been "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with his head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak team of Gladbach could not show their full strength to the weak team of Hamburg.
“That was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol said in a nutshell.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg will turn 121 years old.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to interpret it,” said Marcell Jansen.
It predicts that the partial ratings of the table will correspond more to the velocity of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with their players forced late as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team cannot shine with their successes.
“We need more of the feeling and dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the voting defeat
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
Early news of the bank bailout failure dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest loss of points during a day in its history.
The Dow Jones recovered a bit.
At around 8:30 p.m., one of the world’s most important stock market barometers traded a deficit of 5 percent at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent to 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser in the Dow Jones was American Express which lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of nearly 12 percent.
No title could gain in value.
Goldmann Sachs lost nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, a major investor, Warren Buffet, had participated financially in the company.
The bailout plan envisages making available resources to buy so-called "roten" mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid at a glance but step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial associations that during course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state’s cash.
Stocks in Europe and the US continue to fall
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate goes down and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the financial market rescue projected by the state, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of speculated shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite bailouts by the federal government and private banks, Munich’s one-time real estate financier’s share lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and quoted a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5,839 units.
Financial markets all over the world fell.
The opening of the Wall Street Day in New York City began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package is not enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bill of salvation, the vote in the Senate may be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei main index after profits fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 units.
After the announcement of the capital increase, Arcandor's shares lost in the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the stakes in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years now, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity may not be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent nearly 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are getting cold now threatens a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example from Earth.
This allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Ulysses Sun probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather, irregularities in speed are frequent.
Suddenly the probes have greater or lesser speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter to the curvature of space may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained of astronomers in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter that can also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Researchers of the universe have known about the existence of Dark Matter only for ten years.
Supposedly it possesses the attraction force and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially also any visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, Dark Matter makes at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
As Italy’s foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of the ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the kidnappers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently released.
The same information is presented by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news of the release on the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
“Now we’re controlling his health,” Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well and in security, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the hostages were released: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They were in agreement with the rescue,” the guard said.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and arrested two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to hand over the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
Stepfather's Abuse "Leaded to Suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight counts of indecent assaults.
Truro’s Royal Court, through an inquiry study, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and bandage her eyes before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court what some of Mrs. Rande's friends had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "resigned to life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrace Randle, found the dead woman in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes saying, "I used to tie her and blow her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: “You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a horrific experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, it’s that if she hadn’t, the issue probably wouldn’t have ended up in court.”
He added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse was on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June was going to be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
“They thought it was an internal affair between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that refers to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the capability of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately transferred from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price tag of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley banks.
The government, in fact, provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using savings money, including all 59 construction companies.
The director general of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it “humiliating” that societies and their members have to pay.
Eventually, the $14 trillion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest earned in the interim is assumed to be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently ... are called upon today to pay the price of institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and the mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover <0xC2><0xA3>81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were far less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will need to look at every aspect of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a relevant price,” Mr. Cole added.
Interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which may be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are mutual organizations and have no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
The residents of the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence a litre from next Monday.
It’s the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, followed by research carried out by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves if they want to apply the price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest milk price had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the bail request for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail for extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) from an entrepreneur when he was prime minister.
This is one of several corruption charges against him.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s military-backed government first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given probation to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will make an appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
“The Supreme Court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina, arguing that he could not obtain bail because he was already being treated abroad on parole,” said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We're going to file an appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Her advocates argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after Oct. 17, according to an Awami League leader on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, backed by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have failed to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach the children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge on the Competition Commission following the decision that forced the company to reduce its stake in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Competition Appeals that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests hampered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of the stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, and urged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of American lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the layoff of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved,” Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their charges by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for underperformance.
But it was later learned that lawyers had not been rated worse than other colleagues, and many observers led to the conclusion that dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the redundancies, resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the matter, underlining how he had a “primary responsibility” for layoffs, who “abdicated” his leadership position and was “notably non-collaborative” in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epic of Meat Loaf of Much Honour
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony taking place in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, lasting nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album that Meat Loaf triumphed with in 1977.
The Coldplay group are taking the nominations for this year’s awards and ranking all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, “There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability as was used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 on the chart.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell remained in the rankings for about nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, some simply serviced.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This small alley, about 30 feet wide and 120 long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active lane.
There's no sign.
It is almost impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on Primiera Street.
It wants to refurbish Extra Place and create a clean hallway to shops and boutiques that are expected to open in new buildings.
Other admirers include old-fashioned neighbors who commented to be delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remains of the block’s past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the city’s Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Land Use Vencity Community Committee this month, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community n.3.
"The city owns today very few spaces and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms.
“We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install a few seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first arose during this month’s meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area,” he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe that it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock memorial that closed in 2006, opened at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment coming out on the cover of Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers writing about the East Village’s dignification, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest they may be, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, virtually unchanged piece, a strip of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk about the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: “Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead end, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron store doors and shutters, with week-old newspapers blown along the gutters.”
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and which now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz bottle of beer were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention at Extra Place, but suggested that she could be given a cleanup.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, humid, disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English learners.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which he prefers in classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in nullifying the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in the eastern Los Angeles County region.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income family students:
More than a third of students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively assessed on the math exam of 2008.
and almost equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that Mr. Obama favored.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, the school’s approach to English instruction to students is in “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary success with students like the latter who came from Mexico and that if you enter the classroom 12 months later you would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate by other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubts about the answer, but the idea of his party politicians on the issue of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and his very constant support for obscure bilingual education the prediction of Mr. Obama’s response.
While it is that immigrants must learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue leaving people should stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "you should make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil price drops sharply after renewed economic fears
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 per barrel since Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had dropped to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before falling back, once again, due to enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety seized investors once again on Monday, despite Congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the latest episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, over the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal “seems to have failed to reignite market sentiment.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The prospects for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate are going to be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Analysts have slashed their expectations for next year, as oil consumption drops due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for a reduction in the price of oil and gas is 20 percent by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
Having spent, for the last eight seasons, more time than anyone else in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he saw things unfold in the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned an unscoring game into a game of deflating.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players took a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of these when one cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing in the dam, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to fail by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls made by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardenals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets regained the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
These are the biggest points the Jets never made in a quarter.
Team coach Eric Mangini asked him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, “The second quarter or the third quarter?”
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can say I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third.
They have earned a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Relaxed Gebrselassie leads his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated why many consider him the greatest runner in history, surpassing his own world record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After winning the accommodating flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie broke his previous record of 2:04:26 last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the race against the clock to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would exacerbate his problems with asthma.
Instead, he signed up to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using an average of 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes over the past decade, as Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and that he had missed a week of training.
It is clear that the suspension left him fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I stained some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-Eastern rival - for the style of over-orchestrating his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a runner.
On Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached halfway through the race at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after their pacemakers diminished.
But shortly before three miles to the finish, Gebrselassie picked up a last push to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, upgrading his best personal record for nearly five minutes.
Kamathi reached third place in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko came as a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also took part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her best staff record in nearly five minutes in the third marathon that ran.
He made a smart calculation race, letting a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners do head-on and then recovering them after 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, the pride and trials of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first city entirely inhabited by blacks incorporated into the country and the place of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not one prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous Harlem Renaissance writer.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described — making it also a tourist stop by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers’ Project of the Depression Season — remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Ms. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and who doesn't know what's missing."
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
“We’re very cautious about how our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and a member of the city’s oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a poverty level double the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black south - sometimes dismissed, others praised - that was born of slavery in America.
Not surprisingly, those who live here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her in-depth dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through central Florida often forgotten in the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a cement face in both life and literature, Ms. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road on the left," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor did not.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
“Zora described it as it was,” said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” continues Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, nor major public readings.
“I don’t think their contribution to the world or their inheritance was understood,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street in the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to him relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
“During that season, a group of white boys were going around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people sitting next door,” said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl, too, once.
They threw him at a car watermelon."
In a 1955 letter to Ms. Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court which, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted rather than honored my race."
A Residents say today that the positive disintegration of schools in some respects had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
“Black children were used to being hugged — I remember this — it was used to hugging the teacher in the morning and evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and CEO Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
“I wasn’t embracing your teacher because it was white – there’s a cultural gap there,” Mrs. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudice, just as she did, with boyante, confidence and lines like, “How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her into the American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter went under the spotlights again.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
“The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put on what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
Outside town people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began appearing in large numbers, and residents began reviewing the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Registry in 1998.
A new library (named Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006 on a refurbished and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like you are on a street of the past in a summer rain, in a town as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Strangers who come in search of Eatonville's history, its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A leave in advance is required to do most interviews, and some things — such as murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field — cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw her whole race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare go here, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
Here in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and the gigantic TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of honeycomb offices that lie above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face daily the worst “bad office day” since the downfall of 1929.
Boys for home delivery continue to ring their metal tea trolleys across the sidewalks and carry muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to crawl through loaded apartment buildings, as do human mules, with 50 eccentric-printed shirts hanging from a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers are still waiting in line for their morning takeaway, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees still wait to queue for their bagel to the carts of the vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed to me that there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time it took for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy’s department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “trusted personal banker,” and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places they had switched from, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction company), from credit unions and savings banks in their hometown whose whites only function within the state of belonging, and who claim to treat clients like their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion savings deposits, was looking for a bailout buyer.
The workers at the offices and shops standing in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become experts in finance in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its distressed-looking chief executive officer, Dick Fuld, familiarly commented on the matter as if they were complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, 50th and some uniformed janitor of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my grocery shopping.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a Belgian member of the far-right Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the "Cities Against Islamization" organization in Antwerp, on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs representing the mosques with a red line that crosses.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some of the tombs, but investigators think this may have occurred in an attempt to hide the real motives of hate-driven extremists against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim religious as Ramadan was coming to an end.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the right turn in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that grabbed nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas, and also expressed opposition to foods considered to be Islam-related.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties attempt to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing policy of Islamization in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which have confirmed the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change came primarily from young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban abroad for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a travel ban last Thursday after judges produced evidence of Glitter’s previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25 at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad as well as to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that she wished to travel abroad, under the sex offender registry.
He has to inform the authorities in case he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary for you to inform the police of the planned date seven days in advance of your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss Glitter’s individual case or possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything in their power to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything in their power to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all potential risks more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the primary concern of the Kent police and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risks that may exist to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he returned to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully enforced the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of Home Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, was reassured and glad to learn that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
"I capture the master off-scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no ruffles, no premiere suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
Aside from the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in the intimacy, in those moments outside the public, when they find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hand, carefree because they will not go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser-known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, when seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco.
With the flavor of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dance, singing or touching itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essentials, with the goblin that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Photomata.
Famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to get into their life for a moment, whether it be a long or a short moment.
I think that in photography portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that sometimes you don’t even know, or that give you just a few minutes to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Gallery El Photomata, located at number 20 of Calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a recklessness"
It’s set in places he doesn’t yet know and deals with unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to carry out the new project he works on, a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The ever-favourite Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday during his visit to the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today deals with him "is a recklessness" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
“If I were sensible, I wouldn’t, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days he has seen passing through the city of the Aqueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the Feast of the Word and met the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend", filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated public who was made very short the time in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "pleasure to read" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes "inspired to his disciplina"
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said it "has effects" and "makes people more unconformous," so he asked the writers "not to abandon themselves to their frivolity" and "commit themselves to frivolity."
The weather reduces the fair of Pozoblanco that also runs out of jails
The rejones celebration that closed the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the rejoneers announced that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
Thus, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The inclement weather has started with this fair, as finally two of its three celebrations have not been able to be celebrated.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the holding of the second planned bullfight.
The cartel was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face an incarceration of Castilblanco.
Only on Friday was there a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alexander Talavante came out his two grieved with greetings and an ear, which granted more stretching than his bullfighting.
That is, even worse was El Juli, which passed through the coso de Los Llanos without grief or glory.
In his second bull, after a task of relief he won the anger of a large part of the public.
A control in <0xC3><0x81>lava is skipped in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>ón (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The agents stop the two occupants of a van and they embark on the flight.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
The officers persecuted and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A. A. J., the Basque Government’s Department of the Interior said in a statement.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control on the N-1, as they passed through the municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>ón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and the control was skipped.
Agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later in the arcade, when its two occupants rushed to flee the race through a wooded area.
The Ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bales, so they moved it to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials found that the license plate had been “folded” as it did not coincide with the collection in the van’s documentation, so the detainee has also been charged with a crime of forgery of public documents.
The Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as has been said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A.J., was transferred to police stations to carry out the corresponding proceedings and will be made available to the courts in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a California highway patrol spokesman told People magazine.
At about 4:30 p.m., Locklear was "deeply stepping on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to pull the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and going backwards passed several times above his sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and stepped out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the start, although "according to officers at first glance, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested as suspected of driving under the effects of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison about 7 p.m. but was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where she was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of UI to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the IU and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making favorable treatments to relatives.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," Llamazares said of the performance that the party must adopt with which so far councillor in the Sevillan consistory.
However, the IU leader argued that the need for “transparency” to be present in the possible investigations of the irregularities that Silva may have committed: “IU has always defended that such matters have the highest degree of transparency.”
In the same vein, he stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'Sangre de Mayo', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the celebrated uprising of the Spanish against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of interpreters.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in cinemas, to become the future in a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours in duration.
A great admirer of Galdós’ literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this filming “a childhood dream”, which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid three years ago commissioned him to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set with the decorations and the proper costume the portrait of "an atollronded Spain that was mistaken as a boss to fight for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Ferdinand VII ", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having a funding like that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of Blood of May -, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes embodied in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all of his career.
For this reason, the director of Restart, has focused on what is his usual way of working, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and who does not cast, because he seems "humiliating" and consider that "part of the job of the director lies in going to the theatre and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the performers with whom he coincides in Sangre de mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Oscar nominee on four occasions - one of which won -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the same Blood of May, Seven French Billiard Tables and the finally selected, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be made known," he assured.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
“In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you’re content with making one more movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when he was three years old he moved to London with his family.
She was a free dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I found it amazing.”
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell her life but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested to me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic."
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in the one of "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola older, the character of maturity.
I’m happy that I’ve agreed to act in my work and I’m very honored by it.”
The montage also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Flega and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were always divas, and that they love.
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all of Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think she’s one of those women who have a huge influence in a certain era and now nobody knows and much less puts their work in value,” Bayón says.
The show will begin today at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Reciencasado Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón's anniversary" (2006-2008), with the object of the fiftyth award of the Nobel Prize.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Chopo de Luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, will travel to New York.
Likewise, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Reciencasado Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America Likes Less Without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malice," and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look, it was hard for them to give him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And it was known that he was very sick.
Still, it's been a hammer for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better thanks to their existence.”
No one was afraid to ridicule or exaggerate.
He had died a father of film and homeland at a particularly dark time, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire remain, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost and gained causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his overdose-dead firstborn to his homemade and organic food brand.
It’s a gift to a country that has had a hard time overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration swept through Hollywood without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was neither more nor less than the height of his career.
Australian bad boy Russell Crowe dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"It has left the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high the demand for probity and to have a serious private life and away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their example.
She divorced once but was later married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom she was faithful when she surely had the chances of not being.
"But why am I going to eat burger outside, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters match his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none of them was as proud as that of a devout husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that an Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect race was called the perfect race, and in my opinion it was the worst race I’ve ever been in.
It would be a very clear suspense if they took it into account as an assessment and I examined it.
But let’s go into parts and from the beginning.
The misuse begins with picking up the backbone, which makes you have to go earlier.
Which doesn’t sound bad to me, but if they already make you go they give it all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
No, no, no, no.
Here they just made you go to pick up the back (first misuse, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the t-shirt (second misuse, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or is it because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a minutiae compared to those of the race day.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race started and we still hadn’t left the backpack, although once we got it, the pickup was worse.
In addition, the rain softened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which joined with conatos of popular rebellion and assault on the hut.
I think about 500 people will surely have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear at the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, did not mark the exit correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it wouldn’t fit into my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At MIT’s Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown an advancement of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) based on what it hears in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they wear - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and tells him that he will attend to you soon.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a strategy change at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
All a finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome went online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step in competing with Windows.
Many have correctly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but you have to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative one.
What Ballmer has said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts up just to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft’s employee rest rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soft drink machine a sign asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather pulling to 2010.
At Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to be billed.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick’s ‘Blood Diamond’, as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola’s ‘Godfather’ and is part of the muscular gay parish uniform.
And if we begin to enumerate stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that pointed moustache forcuit lifting weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men's cotton indoor shirt, strapped and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the Anglos call speaking, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all the others.
First, by its rimbonant name - although it is familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with the sport because it gets its name, according to the legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic t-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And watch out, because the Belgian firm’s production is not just focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for underwear comfort.
It's a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
His enormous resemblance to his sister hasn’t stopped him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango makes in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, he wins on short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have devised for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera Dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but at the same time exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; that’s why we got a lot of references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch women dress up, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Ballerina, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot of ties in common.
From a young age, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to sneak into my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
As you know, we dancers like to make our own styles for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you get the costume is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and professionalism.
You've been in your 30s not long ago, did you have a crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and savors life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I’ve done the things I wanted since I was a child and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I am going to be a mother because my body asks for it and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; I do not want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you’re waiting for several premieres that you shot last year.
That's right, and I want you to see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it cannot be.
I'm looking forward to the release of 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
Seeing what they look like...
A few days ago you debuted on a runway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I climbed on a catwalk to act as a model.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, who I’ve known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization ‘Women for a Better World’ and the clothes we exhibited – I pulled out two pieces from our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People are unaware of Naomi’s tender heart.
There are so many things said about her that I, who know her, would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I stay with that good part that she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he ever asks me to do the pine, then too.
To benefit third world women, whatever it takes.
Drivers repeating alcoholic accidents must install the ‘alcolock’
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the drunk vehicle start, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual memorandum of the Attorney General’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so he will also receive a road reeducation course.
In addition to the Attorney General of Segurida Vial, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) Foundation will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving drunks return to the car.
The alcohol lock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in breathed air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow aborts; or when an alcohol concentration is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this sense, a study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure is linked to administrative penalties for two reasons: addressing these behaviors before they lead to criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been implemented experimentally in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5.40 p.m., the scheduled time, the Spanish air force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF airport.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced him to use his hand as a visor to watch the royal couple get off the plane.
On the steps, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that hour... She's from here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 Marines who perform the salvo of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, mane to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual peep-toes, perhaps they had told her that in the DF it was threatening a storm.
They give a smile and a small stop to the photographers before going to the room where the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four majors of the city, a Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
The best gifted award in fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly there is no more exquisite and bont living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Butón-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, watched her designs in Mango’s showcase at 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and almost cried of excitement.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank designer Valentino for presiding over the jury of the contest, led us to end up at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, heartbroken and heart-throbbing, for the recent passing of her brother, put on a costume of the House and some dressings of ELAH, which cut his breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a cannon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner tribute.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, with the baron of Rotchil, without jacket, because both had borrowed them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store in pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she transformed in a sexy long black dress, was excited when on the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she, recalling other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a 'big plie' amago.
Inés Sastre did not stop to walk through the rooms of the palace, but before showed us on the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to rejoice the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon traveling by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously ordered, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And if that’s not enough, they’re all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine yourself wrapped in the hectic rhythm that current life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection from the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities tailored to each's taste and minutes.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores by the hand of publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone feels that it is not possible to attain tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and focus on reading.
Speaking asleep
Some kids talk at night.
I’m not talking about those who wake up very smart and tell us something that happened the day before, but about children who talk while they’re asleep.
The first time it happens you may be scared, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disturbance called somniloquia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (sleeping) or sleepwalking, but it doesn’t have to be so.
As we have already mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stressful situations or overexcitement.
It is an understudied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
You may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or the opposite (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any question that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him exit in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so you have no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stressful picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid shows or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children who have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will help the child have a quieter sleep.
Once the sleepiness appears, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even if he's talking, he's asleep and he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes it would be advisable to consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which isn’t the usual thing), don’t fall into the temptation to make an interrogation to get information from him.
You will get nothing, because when you are asleep you are not conscious to organize your thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what it says, but you do not know what it is dreaming to say that, so very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even joking.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s not bad, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the road to victory in their field after a long period of shortage.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goals and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to rub the squad with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and in turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of his foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn’t let the midfielder pass and left only Riahi in attack position.
The beginning of the second half was crucial, first with two shots from Riahi and Temporale to Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens with the Marais goal, well positioned to pick up the rejected ball in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But scorer Illhusiens will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not seize the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven illousiens who backed a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a major fuss, the ball passed very close to the cross-field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a roundabout in Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance on the part of the fishermen who heavily disturbed last Monday the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports, the president of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find there its representatives.
They promised to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and hoped he would " come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the increase in diesel prices, which marks a record at 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors."
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce circulation in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, by scratching the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous remained in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important refinery Total de Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday’s meeting that will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris ", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the committee of fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay around 50 cents per liter but consider that the financial balance point of a boat can be reached only with a diesel price of less than 0.30 euro per liter.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of "Two Men and a Fate" has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who has passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threat of recession that weighs on the world economy.
The fourth world aeronautical manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been pulled out of trouble thanks to U.S. monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 percent of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to Sunday’s Financial Times.
AIG is willing to consider selling most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets from which AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No definitive decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times is pursuing.
AIG must quickly liquidate to repay its $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing U.S. authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with due proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall on Monday after the House rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen on the Stock Exchange of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq of 9.14%.
The Dow Jones industrial index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, the day on which exchanges restarted after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index by 8.81% (i.e., 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis early in the session, Wall Street sank after the House’s unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed some stability in the markets to regain.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he asked for.
About two in three Republicans rejected his plan.
“That’s not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market had this plan,” added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would arrive “too late.”
“If the project is really dying ... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the American central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further,” said Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, " every passing day the fall of a financial institution is announced " in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities arranged to buy Wachovia’s banking activities by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated drastically, prompting emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing “not just a crisis in the U.S. but a global crisis,” added the analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell 3.632 percent from 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond fell 4.161 percent from 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama wins the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House followed another to find out who has triumphed between John McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes John McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "enoughly "brilliant" to allow him to curb his loss in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama five points in the lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won with 39 percent of the respondents, while 25 percent of them conceded the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his same candidacy member, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with rival Sara Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain highlighted his undisputed experience in foreign policy, underlining the "naiveness" of his adversary on these issues that were at the heart of this first chariot.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... " he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama said he represented the future.
Without being confused, he was concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already,” he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television advertisement that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a heavy rain.
He did not pronounce the words “middle class” or “workers.” “Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is regarded by Americans as the most capable character to save the economy that is on the brink of the cliff.
“Next week could be a decisive episode,” said influential and Democrat Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to Bill Clinton’s during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster “is the final consequence of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would nonetheless reduce taxes by 95 percent on Americans despite Wall Street’s shocks, the Illinois senator also pointed out that realizing the country’s eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewables was his first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, both candidates dodged issues relating to the $700 billion (470 billion euros) financial bailout plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative sessions in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the polling stations in central Minsk square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: “the dictator has to resign.”
Some acknowledge not having voted: "For what, because they will do what they want with my vote," says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put foreign observers on a good footing in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to bring about democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban on 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
“We have been placed alongside the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the vote count,” said Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
“It’s a cosmetic change,” said Alexander Milinkievitch, former candidate of the opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, “because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our house, it’s the executive branch.
If some opposition deputies enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
“But his entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debts in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the turnout figures seemed too high, and that the widespread advance voting (26 per cent of voters in Minsk) favoured manipulation.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five deputies from the opposition to parliament, those who are best suited to power.
The silence of the night returns again in the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, it regained the trust of the public who had been seriously hesitated by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood stores administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations to prevent such a disaster from reproducing.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, nearly 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
After having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained the public’s trust,” he says, before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalled, however, that " trust is an extremely fragile thing " .
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, we were witnessing in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we put in place exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond all doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleidic acid tests that allow the detection of the presence of the virus and not of antibodies to the virus directly in the blood of donors, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleid acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing it and that we will not be able to detect them.
These improvements significantly lowered the risk of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“That means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that you can now receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without any worries,” says the chief of management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant ", Dr. Décary pursues before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
“Needs increase as the population ages.
Since anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which on average brings together only 3 per cent of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All persons with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria can however donate blood every 56 days, that is six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But members of this network of donors need to be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since today’s life is very rampant, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate her blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting in the bank our thousandth sample of blood from the umbilical cord and it is expected to take more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts early next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood taking program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed not to be able to enjoy this " , since Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and costly program at all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact in the Semi-Finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-finals of the USL's first division qualifying series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in short) win at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal from any side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals.
Roger Levesque was the only cheer who defeated Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the round-trip series on Friday, Impact had suffered a 2-1 loss at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the back game to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semifinals 5-4.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The number one trio of the Canadian is ready to embark on the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 win of the Canadian to the barrier free kicks against the Florida Panthers, yesterday night, at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warned the Russian.
“I need another game to feel comfortable.”
He tried to play to the fullest in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation.”
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the launch of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party’s general council ends, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Health Minister, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected during today’s by-election.
Rejecting the boundaries of our last great northern frontier ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength by staying on the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media like during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his schedule was very busy.
The “Northern Plan” is the fourth side of a “vision” that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a “new economic space”, which includes an agreement on labour with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential," but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, forestry, but especially the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France," is our home, is in Quebec.
Not only is it home to us, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush at Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, comprises a part of Labrador that Quebec always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government,” he said.
In addition, “with climate change, we have to rethink our vision of the North,” he said speaking of the northwest passage, which will open every year due to ice melting.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers who came from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec Ungava party), have already begun consultations about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, “not necessarily a summit”, but a meeting in which “a common vision will be given”.
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan “will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to underscore the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s coming to power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future,” said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the program "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Turning to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest underlined that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
“This stays between us, but I expect to be there,” he confided to his militants, arousing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He stresses that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a federation council mission to China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no difficulty in being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec calls in particular for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
It also wishes Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcomed the broad lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The leader of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, resigned its application.
If she had done so, “we would have made progress today,” said Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
Quebec’s Democratic Action appeared to support the government’s adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what is desired, is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Lyrics - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
Dishonor this woman who fought a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what it says all about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are recriminated against him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and lets a child soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who gives false justice to assess the guilt of the defendant.
We recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order for him to enjoy the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not care if a young adult is psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly forever after so many years of exertion.
We do not yet realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our “democracy”, that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when no more morality exists: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government wants so far a minority (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what did the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews the shame is provoked by this resignation and by nothing else.
Free Review - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world’s largest gold company tried a six-million-euro defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of libel persecution, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his?
The outcome of the litigation is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the miner’s nearly bottomless pockets.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will gag the opposition as well as scare anyone who dares to re-examine the matter.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is in front of public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually about changing ideas rather than sticking.
It was therefore sufficient for the miner to open her books, her files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he could ask for a "public" debate despising the views of the latter?
According to the vice president, this word seems to refer only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What he doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – Barrick Gold, is that the audience that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so mostly because it rejects the miner’s brutal manner.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes in arguments, and not within what many people perceive as a persecution-bite (in pursuit of the " public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed a requirement with respect to the authors of Noir Canada urging them to stop using this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal discourse, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the wealthy companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s unreasonable persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that seeks to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by the electors of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, new arrangements to contain the number of houses confiscated for non-payment, as well as a right to audit the wages paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We are making great progress towards a deal that will be effective in the markets,” Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current Wall Street crisis,” she said.
“It’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances about Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would cause a further failure in investor mood.
The last hour they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential election, who have joined late in the negotiations, were rather supportive of the deal, not forgetting yet to express their discontent about being forced to reach this extremity.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the deal, particularly the one that would allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on American television.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, questioned on another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable.”
The $700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers’ money the dubious debts, risky and unsold assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of risk mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and causing a liquidity freeze and a disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe we’ve come out of stagnation since Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
With the goal of clearing the harshness for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to bear losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would pretend to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the president deems necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain stakes in the rescue companies that will earn him dividends in the event of profits and that he will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying embargo proceedings involving homes obtained from real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put under the vote of the House of Representatives from today and that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure if your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this bill, both from Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that “With all evidence, Washington does not want to understand.”
“We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that is to take advantage of taxpayers.”
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is a cheerleader for a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At this very moment, in Europe, we had once again the proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had renounced buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) during the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regained a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, across the English Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that will buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Had the American actor with a charming smile freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensibility, and a talent that was evident will also have removed him from the record of power held by the true sacred monsters.
But what a great cross-country runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the stale years.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, who resembled him a lot and was long regarded as a rival in film, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the burst of dramatic covenants.
Mixed bloods often make magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will emerge one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, last mark of quality.
Because it featured an entire country in love with the self-made man, the Pacific War fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, then frequented New York's Actor's Studio, before triumphing in the theater, on television and soon in cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the second-placed car driver in the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, folded by a sex symbol, though a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the secret sides of this secret star, discreet and committed, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused moviegoers to feel dizzy this weekend, as their big roles were bumped into the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual movement parades through it.
Many memories are recalled as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on Tennessee Williams' adapted zinc roof in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not keep all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have moved on to the history of cinema.
This delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano in Robert Wise’s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly released Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic manganese in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
The times change during his career.
The young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill's (1977) Slap Shot, in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends that abandoned their career quite soon, Newman remained very much in the world of film, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its jewels, and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and that judges its performances too much supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young gallan than of marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed sides of his true, not very well-known puddle sensitivity.
His 1968 film Raquel, Raquel (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work of modesty and sadness.
“Among the numerous tributes that unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former fellow armsman Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) affirmed, very saddened: “My life and my country were better thanks to their existence.”
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen a lot of his face reign over vinaigrette sauce jars, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it started as a gag.
The profits from these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than contenting himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What were they producing in the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing frauds of significant damage, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Office of the Prosecutor, they used the funds obtained in public tenders for their own purposes, often justifying the performance of the tasks with fake invoices.
The public and municipal funds - in total about 65 million HUF - stopped partly in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pockets of private individuals.
The method, which was also disclosed by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the various associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
For this they obtained the talonaries in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others in that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Sides.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for their consumption and these served as a model for making the invoices that they presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Sides and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people of the Pont Egyesület Biztos Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit at once in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the big fancy invoice makers also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft. because in the bookstore of the same - according to information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and de Hoppá.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and showed the invoices, he already knew that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: besides the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the bill, 100 people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people can fit.
In addition, the invoice also included meals, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organises trips abroad, so that on the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated a trip within Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the agency’s practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, despite the fact that travel outside the territory of the European Union was exempt from tax.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ert Foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the hotel employees only issued invoices made by machine however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "expeditors" also made other mistakes, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out road transport that - it was known during the investigations of the prosecutor's office - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Szazazadi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when the Fiatal group Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, which is why the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They consciously discharged the invoices.
Another group of fake invoice makers are those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the prosecution - one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, convinced him to issue fictitious invoices.
Likewise, Zuschlag and its accomplices collaborated with Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület Economic Association behind, without activity.
There was no movement of capital either, because afterwards they cancelled the prepared invoices but forgot to record this entity in their documents.
The following group of fake invoice makers includes those who have some connection to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with its fictional headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company for Atlasz, Hoppa and Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alapítvány collecting the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies worked effectively because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to various entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the company in command Szi-Beri to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért presented a contest in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500,000 HUF from the contest, respectively, but did not use the money for the purposes of the contest.
To prevent this from being discovered, they submitted to the TMA five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably report at the trial - as they did at the Prosecutor's Office - the course of counterfeiting the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything, he has not done so until now.
The question is: what interest does it have to do so?, because perhaps in return for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the Socialists reached an agreement with him for Zusi to assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of far greater value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own homes for the sentence, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of Overlaps: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University discovered the neurological - economic basis for this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study in the journal Science, people don’t want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an overpriced price.
The scientists attempted to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in an auction, and in the meantime, the active areas of the brains of the participants in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (fMRI).
In both games participants could win money, but during the auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in betting is explained as a prevention not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against a person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 prize.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction the members of the group lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
For those up until now explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Around 500 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 are treated because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses dependent on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: Hepatitis A and E by diet (for example with water or infected food), Hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperm, vaginal humor, saliva).
It is advisable for travelers to protect themselves by vaccine against virus A and B, there are no vaccines against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and on the white of the eyes, excrement becomes clear, dark colored urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die from cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten infected people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most people do not know that they are ill because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, premature recognition, systematic medical monitoring, is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
Currently, there are about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory control as well, it is worthwhile to consult with the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease has a cure if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the contagion and prevent cancer.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less for those who believe in God?
According to recent research, religious faith has a calming effect that also relieved the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
In the context of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
This experiment is the first in a series of researches in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University participate alongside academics.
The analysis occurred as follows; they fixed a sparkling instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings; the Virgin Mary, a 17th-century work of Sassoferrato and the Lady of the Armi<0xC3><0xB1>o of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo’s oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics claimed that when looking at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "they reassured themselves and in their hearts reigned peace."
When they looked at the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person they feel very positively about, like a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality,” Wright added.
After these formidable results, one question remains: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You're what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: it can be found both in people’s pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who parallel the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goals of Google’s founders: “We gather all the information in the world in one system!”
According to the Google leader, the company, even after ten years of work that revolted the World, is still in the early stages of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question what is going to happen in five years, Schmidt answered: I would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that best suits me?" - however, software will not be able to answer seemingly simple questions until there is enough information from users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search keywords, IP addresses and pages they visited at the end of the search are accurately stored during their browsing on the Net.
Thanks to Personalized Search, for example, which debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can revisit what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - on this same logic will be based the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they use my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who care about seeing the information monopoly of Google.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only retain, but in justifiable cases also transfer to third parties all the sought expressions, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of internet users.
Perhaps the most debated example in recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
On the other hand, Internet users who care about people’s rights, in May, were relieved when the company together with the EFF, the organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated before the court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution, to provide any kind of information requested in secret.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get around fifty thousand web addresses and about a thousand search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of websites and keywords for the last two months.)
So the opinion about Google is quite contradictory: those who are afraid to provide their personal data criticize it because they think their privacy is damaged by starting to use Google’s services, and they rebel against it as against conservative multinational companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so its rival, Microsoft, catalogued by its Windows as conqueror of the World, no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet that was produced precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of their music customs, then these can be included in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries that are stored in the Flickr automatically appear.
We can know numerous cases from which it follows that for example the bride, seeing the flow of photographs of the next morning from ordinary friends, learns who spent the night before their fraudulent boyfriend or they can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the company's address: one thing is certain, the definition of privacy was completely revalued.
A person's "online" life is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least intends to dodge Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses the Google search system, but leaves no traces).
There are many people who don’t want to register on collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but they can replace Google’s “online” apps, from text writing software to image and newsreading apps with alternative versions that don’t connect to gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion almost openly expects the day when Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the services that are introduced increasingly quickly cause serious headaches not only to other companies, but also to Microsoft.
Critical observers, however, will find the Chinese contradictions alarming as well: for example, the senior management strongly rejected employee protest after doubling the price of the company’s daycare, they considered the unlimited number of employees’ feeding too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company’s entire morality.
One of the company's internal health regulations says that they will not announce any new services in advance, but only when it was ready to operate, which if it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to revolt the world: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines from Google will acquire such dimensions that our company will soon be cited with our health system in the United States, have other problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, will be able to provide a good raw material for the writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man only from Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the traces of the author of the double murder in the city of <0xC3><0x93>zd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd who, on grounds of suspicion, helped erase the traces of the crime, the spokesman for the Borsod province's police general order said on Tuesday.
The girls acknowledged the crime they were charged with, and are currently accused of committing the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency, they are two girls - will be able to defend themselves freely.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people premeditatedly and out of greed.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor at the headquarters of a <0xC3><0x93>zd company, where he killed him and then also killed the victim’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared much earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the crime scene.
The police analyze the weapon with an expert and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which in a few months wants to sell 60 percent of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the Polish offer was the highest among those offered by interested parties by the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the increasingly deepening international financial crisis speak of a "Second September 11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - the Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill made in a hurry, whose aim is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor,” talked about by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more correct to speak of a “Second September 11th.”
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo’s view, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that drove the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is growing more and more, and this will then have an impact on the whole world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, following the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – precisely as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
This threat cannot be ignored - the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva points out.
Some states today can still pull lifebelts at staggering financial institutions, saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if as the dominoes crumble even more bank, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the member states of the European Union to put aside their nationalist egoism and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that concerns are increasingly real that, as the Americans did, also European taxpayers will have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not dealt seriously with the crisis that is going through the Old Continent.
The "saviors" will not have to immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in which cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of obstacle sensors existing in nature?
For example, the bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees set the stage for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-imitating BR23C car robotic steering system, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our protective safety capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of PR and development and research.
The composite eyes of bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees play an important role.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, the engineers used the laser-ray length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle’s microprocessor that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle mimicking the movements of the bumblebees, modifying the steering by rotating the wheels to the necessary extent.
Unlike any current system, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If it weren’t, the vehicle robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Vehicle Robot Project and Mobility Laboratory.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the auto robot the rotary movement and acceleration as well as the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, let alone the storage capacity.
This device in every second only needs to process a few input signals and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with instinctive logic based on the data from the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No memory of gigabytes or megabytes is needed.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which, according to Nissan’s calculations, will be able to be incorporated into series-produced models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, bypassing obstacles in his way.
This dear boy's name is already
The written version of the $700 billion financial bailout package law has been prepared to be applied in several phases to buy bad credits from banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to East Coast schedules during new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion total bailout package, after several days of discussion, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the U.S. Congress, saying that the deal only needs to be formalized in a document.
The pledge on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said: this program will work and be efficient but more action is needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the cart of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 p.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock market.
On the bill called the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, on Monday the first American Congress and then the Senate will vote.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news of the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy bad-quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, the Ministry of Finance will buy credit fund securities, of poor rating and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
This program will be monitored by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion can be spent after a new Congressional decision.
According to the law the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: you can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and securities of credit fund securities, in addition to other "poisonous" type credits as well.
The purchase can be made at auctions or directly - informed competent people of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the elements of concern, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said that the law ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it involves buying bad financial means, insuring them or preventing risks that could lead to the collapse of some major financial institutions.
“We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it,” he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and are waiting for the help of the state will be able to count on the official limitation of their indemnities, which the American slang simply calls parachutes of gold.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of assistance provided by the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry purchases under an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failed head retires.
By buying bad credits directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the compensations of the bosses are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the program as well.
This is the first case in U.S. history that a legal limitation on the revenues of CEOs will be in effect, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional commission responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they will ultimately be able to make profits from the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and with it the bank.
According to the bill in the next five years, the president will have to present to Congress a proposal on how to return to taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their reservations about the project.
“This is not what the American citizens have entrusted us to, that is, they are not protecting taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
Her Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were urged by those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices rose 0.1 percent compared to last month's prices and 12.9 percent compared to August 2007's prices - reported the Central Bureau of Statistics (KSH).
Industrial export prices rose 1.1 percent from July 2008 and decreased 3.9 percent from the previous year.

Industrial sales prices increased only to a minimal extent, at 0.1 percent.
Domestic sales prices for the processing industry sectors rose minimally, at 0.1 percent over the month of July.
The largest increase in the magnitude of prices occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), primarily due to a 4.6 percent monthly increase in bags and belts and a 2.5 percent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the price of the chemical material production branch (1.6 percent).
There was a price decrease in the petrochemical sector (1.4 percent), in the production of electrical machines and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 percent).
The prices of papermaking, publishing and printing did not change.
In the other sectors of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which represent an important weight within domestic trade, there was an increase of 0.3 percent in the month of August, first as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from July 1.
In a comparison over a twelve-month period - in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, there was an increase of 13.2 percent, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of decisive weight, there was an increase of 11 percent.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile industry (2.5 percent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 percent).
In the rest of the processing sectors the pace of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Over the past year, prices in the global processing industry increased by 10.2 percent.
Electricity, gas, heat and water prices surpassed the previous year’s prices by 18.7 percent.
In August, among the different sectors of domestic trade, the largest monthly price increase ( 0.7 percent) was recorded in the sectors of investment goods.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 percent, while prices in the energy sector and the intermediate sectors were unchanged from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest price increase occurred in the energy sectors and in the intermediate industry (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods sectors there was a decrease of 6.8 percent and in investment goods a decrease of 1.4 percent.
Industry export prices calculated in HUF increased 1.1 percent from the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 percent.
The price of our national currency in one month fell by 1.7 percent relative to the euro and by 7.1 percent relative to the dollar, compared to August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5 percent relative to the euro and 15.9 percent relative to the dollar.
Will you no longer need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to enter into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before the Hungarian residents there.
In his opinion, “practically everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic.”
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the premise of entry will disappear, but tourists before leaving the country of origin will have to register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing her the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ financial bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, on Sunday secured their support for the administration’s $700 million bank aid program, while there are politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-like negotiations, announced early on Sunday that a principled agreement was reached on the financial bailout package for banks.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to prove that they are better able than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, by putting economic issues at the forefront, Obama again gained some advantage and disappeared the McCain advantage he had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for vice president.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will swiftly pass the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
“We have to act now and with responsibility ... employment, savings for you and entire industries and the stability of the entire economy are in jeopardy,” he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to describe McCain’s economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that “we will all barely swallow this ... but doing nothing is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control committee to the fineness minister and the limitation of executive compensation, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any major role in the consultations, instead he consulted daily with the minister.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen are likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, but within the group itself the most conscientious voters have become - Der Spiegel says of the weak election result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-blooded coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" discusses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the CSU erosion had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken office.
Social Christians were developing Bavaria for several decades - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of the whole of Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU got 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, still during the aforementioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, the secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernisation also increases the possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious, most critical and most stubborn voters became.
It is surprising that in recent weeks the conventional groups of citizens were the ones who moved the most away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, the high school and the graduates.
Thus, support for the CSU was receded to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, but the Greens still do not wish to consult on the coalition.
Elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely let any of their decks see.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question pending that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the post of vice chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said the cooperation will surely not be successful if Faymann attempts to meddle in the ÖVP’s internal affairs.
It is still open in the party whether they will elect the opposition or join the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government,” Haider said.
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host is France which this year is also president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People’s Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and it is also the biggest obstacle to the prevailing foundation of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for Jobs, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labour market in the first place because of their low level of education.
"Most young Gypsies have not completed secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small part can obtain a university diploma."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these issues both among Gypsies and among non-Gypsies.
For the earlier a gypsy student begins school, the more likely he will be to become an active member of the labor market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - stressed Livia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to speed up immediately the processes of school desegregation, for which it is of fundamental importance to comply properly with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights" - demanded Járóka.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized annually since last year’s Berlin meeting, which was held in the sign of the “European Year of Equal Opportunities”, is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national levels of the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be made at the end of October on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the grave electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut at the top of the Bavarian CSU, for the moment the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party chairman, and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, are still in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party that will be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much criticized duo gave a glimpse: don’t cling so much to their posts.
In doing so, they sought to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and grassroots organization, who a day after the "Bayer tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the crowded coup against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had “monopoly” in Bavaria which gives 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber’s prospective successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that begins negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors about a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the fate is that in the list of Free Electors enters the parliament Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was exploited for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly erased from the stage the ambitious local politics.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition he will receive an active role also Stoiber who so far has been moving the ropes in the background, the former provincial head of government and former CSU president called September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be Chancellor if they are not able to enhance together the CSU that played a significant role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly conceal her disappointment with the failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent reached its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After the elections on Sunday, there will be no opposition deputies in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
While the legislature of the country of 10 million people, made up of one percent and ten deputies, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections, would "constitute" the change of this "dubious legitimacy"
Thus the ODSZ abolished the boycott it originally wanted to make.
At the bottom of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly dependent economically on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give an anti-entry permit to Lukashen.
It was a sign of distraction when the OSCE, in evaluating the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than errors - such as the ban on participation imposed on a third of opposition candidates.
However, the primary OSCE report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners have been released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has already considered the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - Alexandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime is afraid to allow even one opponent to enter that weightless parliament."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations on the basis of the results, but rather tries to convey to voters its message about the need for economic reforms.
- This obviously causes us a lot of problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before its distribution, but even so I see that more and more people support the change among the elderly as well - said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that the regime of Lukashenko, who believes that its main result is the creation of social security, does not officially consider it appropriate even by the pensioners.
Due to the country’s indebtedness and increasing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time for social security to decompose which “seems like the silence of cemeteries,” Milinkevich said.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called the election democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in deeds," so that the lack of opposition is nothing more than the testimony of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you have more breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they set automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against whoever registers and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," the minister said.
“Now a new season of accountability and transparency is opening.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta underlines again.
With Chigi Palace the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, “the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
No resistance has been encountered by the employees, the secretary-general says: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on the part of them."
In short, no more breakfast in business hours; no more coffee and half-moons.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
“In three months, absences from illnesses of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is, 60,000 more people to work in a year.”
And he adds that it is necessary to make the public administration more effective.
“What wage dynamics – the minister explains – in the last 8-10 years have been double over the private sector and well above the rate of inflation.”
For now millions of public employees have joined to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absenteeism from work due to illness – writes the association of consumers – the people of ‘vacant workers’ are steadily increasing.
Millions in Italy are indeed correct and productive public administration employees who have united to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree.
In particular, the Tar answered the exclusion of aggregate economic treatments due to sickness due to service; the extension of the timelines in which the medical check-up visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Work Accidents, Napolitano: "Critical Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been around 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as in homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalid by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and the sensitization of public opinion".
"It has manifested itself, a 'sufficient', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, but the daily reality proposes us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular importance is attached to the numerous initiatives promoted at school level for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the phenomenon alive, not to curb the alarm about social gravity, to implement and improve legislative norms.
For his part, the Speaker of the House Gianfranco Fini underlined "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to put an end urgently".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive development, but this does not remove the number of white deaths from being equally impressive," said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
“We do not want this ‘declining tendency’ to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention diminishes that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level there is still too little done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, at our discretion - has emphasized Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of the school. "
"It serves a further effort - it added - as it concerns communication and public awareness.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers regarding a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the gradual deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship envisaged for victims of work" and "the assistive shift towards which the system is heading in recent years".
“The goal is to give back to the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – because the fate of the person who gets injured does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time.”
Mp3 readers under accusation, endanger hearing
Listening to high-volume music for a long time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
The European Commission cites the opinion of the European Union’s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (Csserri) published today in a press release published in Bruxel.
“From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability.”
“I’m concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music and cell phones at elevated acoustic levels can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way,” Kuneva said.
“From the scientific evidence, a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion so that they are broadly effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this causes.
“Scientists confirm that it is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with member states and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music and related devices.”
Currently, there is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as hearing damage can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and the time of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Ue notes that users of portable music devices listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit on maximum noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany paves the way for the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will deliberate the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official cake" of the Municipality and its intendant Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - it tends to underline Alemanno - It must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then endorse.
There is no position left of roles, only the willingness to have a place to devise a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporal end.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.”
To whom the Commission accuses of uselessness, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that will be done by the Commission and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that come back and forth.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and longer-term, in a deeper foresight, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
"This Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to engage and reason the best minds that the capital squeezes."
For Alemanno, in effect, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which we have absolute need, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, will not be limited only to the current communal confines but will look beyond the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital, but also considering the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that interests him to pass as an independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and connected (as he does now also gives private citizenship) relations with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are escalating as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he will win the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!"
Actually, they’re attacks that don’t say much; they’re clearly racial attacks and they don’t answer the voters’ question: Will he be a good president? And there’s also the polls; everyone says Obama won and with a good edge.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: Once in the cockpit to vote we will know well who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mindset comes out covered to the last.
“Say what you want, we’ll think about where to put the cross, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if he wins Obama, we will leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and they kicked her home in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
For most of us, Iraq has been Bush’s weakness.
Whoever assumes the position of George W will have a tremendous duty to develop.
It uses, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is going the wrong way.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It’s not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many view as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will “do something good” for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers – the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives nationally are sure that their journalists share the same values, while locally the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For journalists it is 30%.
The “safe work” at the staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of “take it or leave it.”
Directors almost always receive good salaries, while writers can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, become “sick” followed throughout the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the field of the investigation on the counter pact related to the escalation Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the arrest process in charge of him, last week, he has obtained home release, transforming it into mandatory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate owner to travel the route from the provincial city to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuse him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the camera of the representatives against the $700 million rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and this one, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times confirms yesterday by informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old soul on the East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new, conservative, hostile soul to "those in Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the central and southern states.
The soul, in fact, has become arrogant with the vow of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This barely cited is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but throughout the West and not only here.
Whether in the United States or Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to act as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that solidify and come to light with the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance them, if they had strong relations with the outside world, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for the one who governs it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or they don’t have much to say: the crucial test is The European Union that is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies fails to decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone is expected to intervene, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the moment you reach the cut it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of resources financed to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization can ever dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to account more and more with the unimmaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things which, you see, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth, but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as sovereign, certainly has many more letters regarding those who are not, and those who have the misfortune of living in a position without crops, without oil, and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but foreshadows a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, of inadequate relieved economic species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in a growing number.
The conviction that before its actions are the same as those of the social elites so far booming, the same way of feeling and being, its culture in the comprehensive exception of the end, seems to have made its own time and to be more foreign to the opinions of the majority seems to be advancing ever more, in various places of the population.
The demand for leadership, in a nutshell, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which is manifested in an electoral “revolt” or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bayern to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus that some of the people in the US have rebelled against.
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent what is taking shape from today are the deep layers of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and agitates potentially in excess.
In the face of all this, speaking of a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come close enough.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have a body of 100 kilos stuck on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, coated with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect grip.
Tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful on the legs of this reptile and at the same time "easily peels off the walls," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Engineering faculty.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through walls exactly like the spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superheroes.
Another research - The University of Berkeley, California, is also engaged in the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers as hairs that self-clean from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, efficiency with serious consequences for health.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the risk of some medicines and to reduce the effects of some medicines.
Grapefruit juice was already under accusation because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurologicals.
The same Italian drug agency had reported the news in a news bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger stemming from this mixture and to pay attention to things being drunk in case a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone is being taken.
NOT ONLY POMELO – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milano, said: "These findings in general are pointed to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the informative notes of the same.
That is why you should always read the illustrative brochures of the medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us impress, ask clearly the doctor or the pharmacist "said the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Economic Novel by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of commerce and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a notable New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attack, in those days when Enron was breaking, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, ultimately of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years was reproached to the economy, but that has now proved accurate.
"I'm surprised and a little upset how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank Executive Committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist,” but also a publicist with a “very aggressive, particularly critical style against the Bush administration’s liberalism excesses.”
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from the home to the office to the professionals of the public administration, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work by the volunteer developers, of whom their backs are guarded by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: the welcome screen and the less rude revised interface, more consistent ones are added, such as the support for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version.
Attention also to multi-function with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the dimension of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via electronic mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphic processing module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements in the interior of the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the commentary for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, over the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English language that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of free can be a hook for diffusion in the homes, it is in the business that the Open Office suite tests, tries the big bet, and can already count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of the well-known Access is the program that consents to work on the data base; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached almost 3 million 600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that it can be exceeded the expected figure.
Kohl is the fourth case of doping.
New positive case in the tour of France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the team Gerolsteiner, third-placed and winner of the best runner-up shirt.
To share the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive runner to the Epo of the third generation, after Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
The tests of Kohl's blood champions are among those carried out in recent weeks in the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratory.
If the counter-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place to the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl’s positive doping to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, winning the shirt of the best climber.
Immigrants: NEW YORK TIMES QUESTIONS, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy’s emigrant country has only recently transformed into a privileged destination for hostile immigrants.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? That is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case evidences what the New York Times defines as the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where there is “more integration and more work” but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support in the Northern League.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation wanted by the Lega tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestine people is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The Pope said: “Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI in Congress, has called for the state and the church to work together to combat racism.”
Students are victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for college students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the union of tenants, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome.
"The phenomenon has already taken on very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to sustain - explains the head of the studies office of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has totally deformed the market to the point of triggering a process of widespread increase even for residents."
Apart from the fact that in most cases the rental offers contain a number of violations: free, unregistered type contracts, no fee limit, sub-leases linked.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of taxation, prices can be regulated.
Looking in detail at the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
It is economical only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surrounding area.
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed you will be served 250/350 euro, at least 350 for a single.
in the smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and extra-community students is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the fee to foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, cities cancel historic theatres
The historic cinemas close favoring the Multiplex.
“A city without movie theaters in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the big gimmicks in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the monkey halls in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared", observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury to Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way of life that always lost.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and most of them are the halls of the major cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 less cinemas, following Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that responsible for its disappearance is the avenue of multiplex, these three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new cinemas mixed: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has been developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, “it would be useful if new structures were constructed but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the mixtones.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful, ethically and morally, that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year.”
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to worry about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono sala is in the historical center that in the periphery.
Among the envisaged rules are mediated tax facilitation for managers and benefits for the public at mobility ends: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic zone and will have special rates for parking.
“It’s an initiative I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of mixers, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important to me: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the already closed Rialto or Quirinale via Nazionale, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
Tie between politics and 'ndrangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the cosca Piromalli."
The accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the mayor and vice mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association, are heavy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, the boss's namesake lawyer, were also arrested and sentenced for mob criminal association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Despising any legal and moral norms, and in good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been allowed to the mafia family - the judges write - to officially enter the internal of the municipality facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loirero does not hide that "arrangements between organized bad life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean."
Those arrested this morning are added to those from last July after police had announced the cutting of heads of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged constraints between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been dismissed from the task of managing the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, intendant, of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I exploit a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the city council.
I call into question the deputy minister of the interior who at the time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political matter, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even gone so far as to call for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration over the interests of the mafia families".
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage.
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the major global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil was low in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was set aside, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give the sector momentum.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity need could be met by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This amount would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 sealed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying technology on ocean energy,” the spokesman for a company associated with the US oil colossus, told the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important signal, considering that in Alaska the US continues to mine oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy there is no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now impacts like those Portuguese or Scots are small in size and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bonded boas between them.
The force of the waves, which causes the boas to move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure rotates a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type in development, awaiting only federal approval, apart from energy, could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines on New York’s East River.
The movement of water when there are tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary motion that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of customers awaiting the necessary permits to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electric Energy, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It is mostly about tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
