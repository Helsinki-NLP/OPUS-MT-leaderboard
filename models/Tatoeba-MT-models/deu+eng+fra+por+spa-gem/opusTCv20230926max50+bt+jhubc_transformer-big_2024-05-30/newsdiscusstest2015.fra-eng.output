The UKIP survivors who reject those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK for health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to line up behind chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the ones who use some kind of disgusting argument.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing madmen, virtually does not exist.
I think that’s what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a towel does not constitute evidence.
Yes, shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for propagating such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You also don’t know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when trying to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's phrase surprised a lot, but only because we so rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to be able to recover.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don’t like it when the media talks about what you don’t like.
It is so rarely talked about because unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcher followers who think that AIDS and flooding are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
In the end, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the period of austerity will not have arranged anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland was praised as the "TIGRE OF EUROPE" a few years ago.
We've seen the aftermath!
It starts reading the article again.
We are trying to make it seem that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a "NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE" is happening.
With the agreement in Brussels, taxes on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients there is nothing to ''pavish'' at the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the eighties of the twentieth century, irlance was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with Portugal Considering a constant perimeter, without the new and country, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is clear in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on companies.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the taxes actually paid by the multinationals.
According to a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% overall in France.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and cheerful) cars all over the street corners, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily plugs since the return of the year.
Is it supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon flare up.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a collision on the A140.
Is Ryanair now planning to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so some bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it's not going to be on either of those two once it's re-released.
This is entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers an additional fee for the additional fear we were willing to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give it to their hearts.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to the place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic fare just have to blame themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be pleased with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air traffic controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good voyage
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally crowded.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (some, for the most part) nor for the Salon de la revue at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and vibrant.
With a lot of foreigners spending...
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sundays, crowded with 50% tourists.
<0x40>Aloes False!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in tax-free.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
There is still the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices .
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed, except for exceptions, by employees.
This is why it is provided and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs, nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has the slightest power to reform the Labour Code.
As they shut it down.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies who want to work on Sunday.
In Montréal on Sundays I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal biblio is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
This is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he tenaciously defended against fascism
the way of life that he tenaciously defended against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against his will, to use to pay the estate costs?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some not terrible.
Probably his estate would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the Nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
I don't know.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to the other aristocrats of the government who wanted to discuss a “deal” with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and ultimately the whole world, can thank God for having had Churchill at the helm during these five years, just those five years, and none else.
Churchill’s greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to raise the money of the estate fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them collect the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure works are by definition not very renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they well reflect the real evil of France:s distrust of dialogue
Return to Princes values.
An unemployment insurance reform is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need.
Either solidarily we come to his aid, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who lives on income from his properties.
There is a need to differentiate between those who invest for a return at the time of their retirement and those who live on their annuities.
A property to rent or even two for a couple above, it is vice
The little genius of finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of major works, but in a time of lack of major infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in no way could a new deal be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decay emerges in response to a recession that is only a savage and therefore brutal decay.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less severe, then the need for investment is screaming: insulation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc.
A tax that promotes high incomes and renters.
Who's in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallop.
Samsung's profits are undermined by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple's mid-September introduction of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft set up this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them the options, functionality and price take precedence.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a “better platform.”
Is there a “better car manufacturer,” not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in our interest to all of us.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and it’s not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, on Parisian bobos) could tell us about which author(s) they fight ideas about gender and tell us about the works they intend to fight.
Or are they just tackling the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, John, I love you, and you're an intelligent and cultivated person.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holoferne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I do not have her vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you refer to it, this topic does not interest me, and sincerely I do not see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
<0x40>Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne does.
Who is afraid of the world?
What are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and <0x40> give us answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by describing Judith Butler as a very symbolic throat slicer.
We can see how much these studies affect the most intimate in their homes.
We are obviously no longer in the idea debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
Did you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
<0x40>: As for an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To pretend to fight ideas from the only exposition made by their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But well, as I explained to our Umpfrontist friend, that's the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure that the nuance is understood.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I was content with the "second sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat compensated for the disappointment of having the sight sometimes blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, the cloud of last night would really enshrine the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey holds the Labor accountable.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover up the Perseid meteor shower throughout the week and for virtually every major astronomical phenomenon in recent years.
I'm starting to think that there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting greatly better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn’t see the eclipse because of the clouds over Melbourne’s suburbs.
I'm going to put a TAX on this eclipse.
Anyone who watches this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it (necessarily) disappears?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Superb photo of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between income from labour and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon.
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hyperlink to the original documents so that we can make an opinion.
Go see today, Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest in five years.
In Greece, the stock market collapsed.
Yet these seem to be the examples to follow.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of Economy asserts that these claims are unfounded.
What if the Ministry of Economics made a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who have gained the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when presenting the invoice to the state budget?
The sequel in its time.
Okay, thank you, JYL....
<0x40>lol No, the State is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifespan of its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to the financing of material and intangible investments that guarantee future growth and thus future revenues.
A few points of answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember Hippocrates’ sacred oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth doesn’t match your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands bound by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgery, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues the politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money from drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Because the Liberals want our health care system to look like that of the United States, you should find out how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been misformulated to blame the toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to corporate profits and “research”.
So read the few rare reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenses and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare global drug prices everywhere, as well as country-to-country differences on what is over-the-counter or prescription only.
It is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations for cancer pain, despite the laws that hold them back and the expensive permits that are needed.
While manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy to use alternatives such as marijuana, those who achieve a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit widely.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of an official of that hospital.
We can't hold patents on grass...
If social science “researchers” were doing research instead of politics and networking, one could use their “work.”
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
To compare is not to seek.
Comparing is doing pedagogy, not research.
One cannot say "the research is complete, it must be applied" and then in the same jet "you have to experiment at all times".
If your research is complete, why experiment?
If your research is not complete, why are you asking us to apply it?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they get to learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are just an indicator make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologists away from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
reread the paragraph on the internships (which is unfortunately not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion drives us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of the practices in force, and that does not allow to advance the system ".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system one cannot wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in a modern training of teachers.
Education theorists should have no place.
Practitioners should have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of problems in the education system.
Giving more weight to education theorists would destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally misleading: if I would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who has only a theoretical background, even less would I like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical background and who has learned on the heap.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP in charge of David Cameron’s copyright infringement
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR ex-mayors thank you.
If one day I begin to feel guilty about copyright infringement, it will be enough for me to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
This is the same as they must cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright infringement.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without having the proper license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can still debate pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't be true.
This is a copyright infringement.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Obviously, you don’t mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what reasonable use should be, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they clicked.
Maybe if they share the headphones of their mp3 player with a boyfriend on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Oh, if we could export this resource that we are abundant with, the scoundrel who says everything is wrong....
If it's a PS member who says it, then we have to believe it.
I have two children and when they are old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continually assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down is speeches like yours.
<0x40>gus I have always worked in a private company.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm an employee because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red bullets at the dumb bosses I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
<0x40>gus, if we compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to demand reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized companies and small - What do French bosses expect to do the same?
Let the state hold their hand?
This state they accuse of imperity?
<0x40>Jacques L.
Always this anti-business leaders couplet on your part!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
<0x40>Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France faces an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who muddle and grumble while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
It's terrible.
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers’ charges, taxes, 45-hour work per week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I'm from, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves afloat rather than transform themselves.
This does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since Last took care of them.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
Well, Labour is going to get us out of boredom, isn’t it?
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from creating a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all of which was to get the decision finally annulled.
And there’s better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
So we can assume that they will be happy with this decision;)
Perhaps it is because the management of the Dutch is on track while that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchiser.
“She was a beating girl.”
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "battling" is a superior quality to many others, the concern for others, intelligence, listening, for example, the fact of being "battling" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "battling", who are nonetheless dead, I know of palladiums.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's do it again, too.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to get rid of it, I'm telling you it helps.
It has nothing to do with any merit...!
When it comes to the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
Insinuating, even for a moment, that one can have merit in getting out of a disease or that one can be deprived of not getting out of it is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that lets go, everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
Sorry to think otherwise, though, having a solid morale probably makes it easier to accept and prepare for heavy treatment, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is battling in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if you prefer to rely on the "lord" that's something else.
Neither with courage nor with merit.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of becoming a zombie.
Personally I caught two of them, dirt, big ones, and if I "fighted" as these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is all about grinding your teeth, suffering hell and getting the beatings.
I thought the charge against Milosevic was decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on? What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told back then?
The nationalist communist who sparked three wars in the Balkans over the past decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
So please ask what we have voluntarily left out: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the LESS Rule of International Law?
Which country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, it would be swallowed by the Western compressor scooter.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign state which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was promptly recognized by Western states who then lied end-to-end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic purification).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time.
In the end, the Guardian shouldn’t call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
To my knowledge there is only in Greece a method of predicting earthquakes works roughly, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules," according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming University and Jonathan Fraine.
A method to follow.
Just like those involving animals feeling a threat coming.
Thank you Passeur de sciences for treating us, often, to these experimental feats that are carried out in the world.
How Do Animals Know (In Advance)?
Probably through the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
An a priori odorless gas for humans but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for humans, but not for the measuring instruments at their disposal.
But we have no reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on arte telling of the struggle of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to make the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more particularly to their modification before an earthquake.
I am not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me.
Or is it about this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should re-learn to listen to nature...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by animals, we collide with the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned bizarrely in circles.
I don't understand how you can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't help but think that this man doesn't know anything about it and that he's always trying to divert himself with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He could not name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor and he didn’t keep one.
It just underscores how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because it's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in “Have I Got News For You.”
Because she's a celebrity and people have been instilled in celebrity worship.
The Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will break the ceiling I'm sure.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than he was.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as president.
The French have been really and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read a few books (there are some, including an excellent French by B.
Millot), the "Solomons" and the "Scrap Strait" speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruiser, Australia, must always be there at the bottom since the Battle of Savo) do not want to return there.
We actually passed the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission comes to an end.
They're the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoking.
Calculate the kerozene consumed to achieve the goal totally discredits the concept.
Just browse the list of sponsors that philanthropists.
A com operation is neither doing nor doing.
The cow makes me want too much!!!
I am looking forward to the web series!
Your recitation makes me look back, identifying myself a little by the way (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the White Mill in Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep reviewing us, and proudly show that Bretons are great travelers!
Peter, from Trinidad and Tobago.
I think the red hat who protested against taxes is pleased to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote a penny of our taxes to financing the dreams of some even as friendly adventurers as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation who are of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e, are from Mitrovica, but I don’t know if they are still in the team.
It's Bisevac, Lyon's defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or before in the 70s and 80s and has trained many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he’s from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great team of Velez who, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had sizes such as Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsène Wenger's loyal teammate).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *shift*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, and then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he is not titular there.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all the regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania from before 1913, when the major European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighboring countries.
How can one have felt an "explosion of joy" seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children are inside?
How???
What disturbs me a little in this "testimony" is that the only fact that I could spontaneously rejoice in the horrific death of thousands of people, in my eyes, testifies to a "border line" personality of which all "testimony" should be taken with the utmost caution.
No doubt, in the short moment of "joy," we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
It will just have been thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to really and apocalyptically wrong the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To make QQch powerful.
That's great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims eaten by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic damage pleasure.
We were a little doubtful.
The “Christian/White/Galilean” West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today’s Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The splendor of the past, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers in place and fascistic nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we understood before, should not push back the Muslims.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess this is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet, depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of about to die.
In Britain, if you’re lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, don't make your grumpy clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to germs from the outside, it can change, I guess.
It’s not about to die, it’s just a step in a cycle.
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a feverishness that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and many other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of increases for children, it is the amount collected by the State that comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households that have seen their taxes increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are affected ( median income ) according to chart 2 .
The deletion of the half part concerning especially widows is not addressed at all in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to settle.
Well, we're not on the straw certainly, but dreamers
For once the PS makes a rather leftist policy we will not cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% must bear far more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let’s keep doing this and you’ll encourage those 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I say it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the OIC recycled to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to raise as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is, to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are among the richest 20%.
Probably also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed).
Fair taxation should allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or else just as much to lower our arms and live social minimums, especially if we have social housing.
The utopias of the red Khmer head cutters have fortunately lived.
I did two Airbnbs in Norway recently.
It's okay.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the front desk or face the slightest hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, put it behind you and leave.
From now on, this will be my first option when I’m traveling.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you will need some kind of homeowner insurance.
Be sure to use a service with the right logo!
Oh, six o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky” No, it’s not true.
You just really missed luck.
From the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb’s response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to stay a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but anyway).
So why does this article cite Teman complaining that he did not receive any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as well as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm planning to pay a down payment and a month of rent all at once but I'm a little scared to send <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Supporting the troops,” sang the Herie in all tones...
Weapons are harmless.
I am sure it will please the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We all agree.
You think this is the time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: This is ALWAYS the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if “they” were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
Currently, our teachers earn more than engineers.
And don't let us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But this is not to be seen since National Education does not have the means to provide an office at the college / high school to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Besides, it's so much hiding at 5pm a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the CAPES with maths, come on, we're waiting for you.
What do you mean, you don't want to coltinate poorly-educated bastards whose parents spit on you calling you a scoundrel?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Khurd population can flourish better.
The Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduating job was in sales, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a job for which you needed a degree.
A year later, I saw an advertisement to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid an extra <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 a year and we didn't even apply for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
About this, don’t worry if you can’t find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well or that you like to do.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student loan.
I don't like corporate work so much, so I hope to eventually move on either in the public service or academia.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Get rid of bishops such as art/letters/theater/media/philosophy/political sciences, i.e. so-called unemployed degrees.
I have one of these degrees and I finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
The starting salary was lower, but we quickly climb the ladder because in the real world what matters is results rather than knowledge.
This debate engineering studies / artistic courses have lasted for years.
Scientists can't solve all problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in order to get results.
Are letters, philosophy and art bishops?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about diplomas like media study or whatever abscond course you've been to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn’t it be better to have a real territorial policy to unburden Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I do not see the inhabitants of the bottom of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise doing 80km round trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intramural and small-belt residents already have many alternatively more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as already exist in cities in northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by the 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well, we couldn't find a place for a single bicycle hanging device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë.
Well, it's not all right.
When we talk with pedestrians and other users of public transport, no pedestrians and pedestrians, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals, no pedals pedals pedals, no pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals pedals peal
Bicycle paths are apartheid, we must cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in Greater Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bicycle in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% of cycling is ridiculous.
I'm starting to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, according to OR, the Deputy EELV seems skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racketeering begins, it would be better to find out who is really hiding behind this massacre.
Note: This is not Russia.
I'm not sure I love the way the world is changing.
It sounds horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case to the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they should first file a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been shot down previously, Ukraine was launching airstrikes in the area against the rebels and any plane could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people so that airlines pay the overflight fees of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls defending their usurping government/the ultra-nationalists of Western Ukraine – and wanting to show in bulk that Putin shot down MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 ruling of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA’s supply of weapons to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far, investigators have not said anything like this.
To be called Ricardo and to be such a Bootian in eco is distressing!
Calling himself Polar is losing the north is joyful.
One question from Béotien: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can’t help but notice that those who criticize Piketty’s book most virulently haven’t read it!
It's easy to read, it took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequalities-concentration, inequality of income from work, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today reconciles that of the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You said no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is right, one can discuss it without having read the book, the main thing of which is to argue one-way in favor of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavement summarized by the press false?
I have not read it and will not read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this one that seems to me pure fumistry.
The concept of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn’t humanity enriched itself overall?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope this award will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that it is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn’t where she is now, she would have been married at age 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “colored perverts”?
You should not have any “antenna time” on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely outrageous.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when he was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are enrolled and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
He is, and has always been, for her to receive a higher education and for her to have the right to decide her marriage for herself.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14, without a say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may sound contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at age 14.
Rather disappointed by this entry in regards to season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a little trouble finding her Marlene Dietrich sosie character.
I’ve just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it’s one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange’s show singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I would rather have all at once than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is certain, apart from Jessica Lange’s extraordinary, it’s above all the risks of staging and editing that made me sit.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the aseptization of productions today.
I miss it a little bit to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many more things.
It’s not simply that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really one of the mainstays of the series apart from the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end like 24 hours.
Everyone does what they want, huh?
It is by what I say “I will not look afterwards” that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal to her.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let’s talk less about tax increases, please – let’s cut back on government spending instead.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to blow up spending failed.
Unleash controversy over relatively small spending items, such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to call their vows and all this time some in each camp pretend that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their play and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
“Debt” is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government appropriating a third of my income (before I even talked about consumption taxes) if I thought it would use it wisely.
But that’s not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but well, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the subsidies to wind turbines almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you come to a figure that makes the ridiculous on the Lib and the Labour tax seem more ridiculous.
Your first <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns <0xC2><0xA3>35,000 a year will pay about <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 would pay about <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (a fifth), etc., and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 pays about <0xC2><0xA3>70,000 (a little over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car sticker, and it is before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car sticker.
I get paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend that money falls from the sky, or that it doesn’t matter where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for work from door to door prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed wouldn’t search, that means 80% searched and didn’t find.
As an unemployed person, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my odds as much.
Actually I haven't heard from P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi in months, does that mean that agents are more busy with checking operations than actually bringing in job ads?
I don't see the interest.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then Pole Emploi must be dispensed with.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we ensure that the unemployed fulfill their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks the users of a means of transport, a head of service or the employees of their work, etc.
Nobody screams for scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I have dealt with P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
Registering and control currently takes over, while statutory P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should only concern the employees, they are the ones who pay the costs.
Unpaid politicians and French people give themselves rights they don’t actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that a dignified unemployment insurance contributes to the valorization of wage-earning work.
More than just waiting for tweets of assassins in Arabic...
In reality, there needs to be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with the war and displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis have had the spirit to ban this year the Hadj in Mecca to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have been denied their visa application because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was a case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit presence.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from flying to Europe?
I thought it was common sense but apparently those who "know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put in strict quarantine.
Nobody's going out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Last week alone, people were contaminated after having contacts with people in West Africa despite taking “all necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let's forbid them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained in identifying people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be immediately quarantined.
Let him get the message from the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt he is able to erect into dogma the image of God characterized by the total of the cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that conception.
It has only been 20 years since information emerged as the given premium of humanity, while religion, coming from the brain, may have been directing our actions since Lucy.
What is the point of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize wouldn’t set foot on the Church anyway, it’s just to see the low number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiety"?
<0x40>louise: Sorry the church does not have a view limited to France.
And in the world, it may be that it will reach more people...
<0x40>Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envisage pre-existed to Christ.
Hillel once said, “Do not do to others what you don’t want done to yourself, this is the whole Torah and the rest is just commentary: go and study!”
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "promoting justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: we take away the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain that hero who has upset moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and forced into immigration a few centuries ago.
I don't know if I'm going to buy the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It can't be invented.
I would personally choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don’t think it’s worth <0xC2><0xA3>30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll look.
Obviously not at work.
The IT department's joy flap blocks all the nice sites.
Hello, is it <0xC2><0xA3>30 then 20% off, or does the <0xC2><0xA3>30 include the 20% off?
Please note that the PC version is only for DX11.
It surprised me, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's null.
It's time to buy a new video card *shut up*
This is a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon <0xC2><0xA3>30 for PC, <0xC2><0xA3>35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, <0xC2><0xA3>44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll erase it from your library if they decide to harass the people who buy it there while they're out of the intended area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was France in 1940 a “rotten earth”?
So say, this Nobel Prize sounds like a poisonous gift to me.
Must we love the France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we don’t even want to read the award-winning authors.
Will Brazilians, Chinese or Australians read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobel laureates are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano to his right, if they don't already know him!
For your part, keep dating Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep their chances.
So let’s see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Say hello to the awful ones.
Since I drove one in Iceland, I’ve been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she's trying to crush me?
Or swallow me like the horrible Superman III computer?
Hello Dantra, still hatred?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my medicines.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Party.
It was brothelical.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, with Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people out there, there weren’t just CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner chance I was able to go back with several decent bets.
I hope if I get to 95 I'll be as vivid as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
Having said that, without wanting to upset you, I think you are moving a bit away from the subject.
This famous totality, it forbids quests for jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
It immediately reports arms trafficking.
Either we have eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have eyes wide closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental contradiction: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, whether Muslim or not, who have formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, whether Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these official unanimous condemnations.
Who does not say a word of consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval of the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they publicly demonstrate to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is, in my view, the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the disintegration of French society.
If there is no doubt, I would say so.
Who doesn’t say a word of consent, but what does he consent to?
Consent to proximity to IS or to the condemnation of IS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to spare goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically unsustainable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster in the elections because a huge gap has been dug between their decentralization proposals and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified to lose all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't care about Scotland because they don't have any seats in it.
They can do whatever they want with electoral impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good thing in the long run for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "Promise" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing he was signing the death warrant of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are holding their leaders accountable.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected in England one day.
Taking 8% to the detriment of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on matters that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists, and she did it well.
Yet he is still in the race to be prime minister in 2015, and that’s since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and all the way to the end.
This is East Germany’s “Life of Others” or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will at least have a sterilizing effect.
I’m waiting for the next post: Amazon makes YOUR book based on YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!

Strongly stimulating.
Thanks for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have to read the pirated files, books in the public domain or bought from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without snuff.

There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country appears to be led by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic children under acid.
This is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
Interestingly, some supporters of Erdogan think Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot itself in the foot unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will fight back, so it is actually shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to try to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran would send a serious warning of retaliation there or simply advise caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises us is that today’s Iranian and US diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
Indian Punchline's reading is to be highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to detail rather than the c*nering swings by the traditional media. The short article you link to is important and should be read bearing in mind previous realistic observations/warnings from Iran to Afghanistan's proposals around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these “moderates” who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy pushes the world to the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent “moderates” to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending others’ children to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
A Nuremberg trial would be needed for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it “needed”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my friend.
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the triumvirate of the CUP that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by vengeance by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a paumed area of Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding there a tuscan empire.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the sophistication of the fatal slope, but apart from that, one seeks in vain contact with the real.
That's clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the womb of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may simply be a child’s desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterile heterosexual couples, too.
As for the children!
What a shame to call them psychologically imbalanced futures.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to make a living and to pay the retirement of this lady (?)
The GPA is arguably a provisional "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.

Many women bore and gave birth to children that were not of their husbands.

The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, aren’t cosmetics also the commodification of bodies?
Anakronic color unit ...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good woman grow in a distant country via the internet and Pay Pal than to assume her responsibilities and or to avoid the scandal in another century near home without shouting it at that time on all the rooftops! ...
These practices were not done in the name of the church!
It is not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices...
However, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.

I don’t know why there’s so much contempt here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they’re posted by people who’ve never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article about football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of reporting that really reflects the reality of Northern England’s culture.
No wonder Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can listen to it if you’re in the London area in November: 99psoul will again be playing soul vinyl, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here's a small well-written and well-thought-out article.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.

The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
<0x40>Jonathan: Netanyahu is not seeking peace since he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (in fact, that was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents all preferred occupation-colonization over peace.
He took off his clothes, laid them on the rock, and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative stood up angry and shouted, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the Palestinian Authority’s bipolar government and will not lower their guard.
That this displeases anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
This has been the case since politics became globalized.
Avoidance, Avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it certainly continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What relationship of force allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is even today a balance of power!
Do you doubt it?!!!...
Besides, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Much of what he says are just pseudo-Chomskyist balleveses written not others.
This proves that you don’t understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand tells certain truths, perhaps truths that we prefer not to think about.
Hold on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand is horripile to some: he sometimes talks pretentiously and after all the tabloid nonsense he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but all this story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that he just tells people not to vote and rather to vote in favor of just to ignore the five years and to ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he has posted, he says that to vote once every 5 years only for the Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limit the democratic commitment to that is not enough.
I’m not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active in presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are whirlwinds that will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it’s just annoying to see all those condescending answers that say that it’s not going to be better than to vote for this fool who does Jesus tell the youths to disapprove.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be nice if people debated what he actually says rather than simply labeling him irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The voting thing has been completely distorted.
The uselessness of sliding a ballot into a ballot box every 5 years makes me deeply upset since my vote really matters nothing.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and members who are accountable locally to their voters.
In addition, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand’s remarks are not his own (written by others).
He is clever enough to have his own words and ideas, even if they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label “pseudo-Chomskyist bullfights.”
I am quite convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that’s what the Guardian could do, for Suzanne to do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the noddings added to the editing!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he’s going.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This “slingsling” reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the RDVs of History where professional historians have become a minority and where exchanges of specialists have become impoverished to the benefit of ready-to-think condensed type Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They develop both very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on those scapegoats which are the keystone of their thinking.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
We solve the problem of the relationship to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchizing, neo-lib and/or libertarian slope (of both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to seek state aid for its markets) in the sense of at least state/no state at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself beautifully.
Its thought is built on the guilt of the state: without that guilt it cannot stand.
Whoever says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stand against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
Nor any support, by the way.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its god then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Ouala, you probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology from Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet makes a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the mechanism of membership in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by humanities researchers from the hard left who can’t stand the fact that one goes from allegiance to their mantras is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows” I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing from our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese.
In London and they were kind to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same way about whites.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them make violent anti-White statements.
My father isn't happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians have mostly prejudices against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very fortunate to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the opinions of Australians about Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, when I've met two in my life (one of them abroad), I haven't kept bad memories, all the people are worth it and, in fact, those in London were very nice, that's the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, all people are worth it, how to remember who was who.
Do you know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that said White.
How many Chinese men are with whites, by comparison?
None, because there is a good chance that the parents of these Whites would physically assault them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
Yet it is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left like the judiciary union...
<0x40>Marabout: Sorry, but the court circles are frankly brand right.
When it comes to the judiciary union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of the application of laws in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
The political vision of the observer as well as the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It then remains the obligatory tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecution, forces a distinction between the error and the bias of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice were not divided between these three groups.
Claims and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only through statistics implicitly revealing that it starts from a very low point.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to enter the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* conferred on the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The field considered is that of the plundering* of heirs committed by means of scams to the procedure* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession gets a good year badly 150 million euros while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, some of them were reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the said statistical improvement moderated by the previous comment, is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to be robbed in this way, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all the laws favorable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria an elaborate form of lying?
Probably totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment to scam the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, built to his size and weight, and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never before a normal wheelchair, with cumbersome wheels and tires, could not.
As they say, the tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi resembles what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The tank chair looks epic.
I don't think the inventor of the Whill ever had to clean a dog scum on a caterpillar.
I’m sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it’s just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for longboarding.
There are hills that they would like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bike, so “you see.”
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, though.
Many of them have reasonable amounts of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The trick is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know we need.
We can’t really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it is just a draft, it is not planned to make it.
I'm CONTENT that the "long-distance" wheelchair doesn't arrive on the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this fucking thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intensive bombing of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as well, since this blockade inflicts a “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
“Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market.”
Oh that's not the wooden tongue, rather in concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There is the black market that is certain, and recognized.
Two million people have been imprisoned by the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-guarded territory: Saudi Arabia.
Mursi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whoever you know) excluded him!
Remember also that after lifting it, Morsi had re-established the blockade!!!
And I am a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Block is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built on the back of the people who have chosen their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought about it.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, not for profit.
Many are only looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted landlords and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this?
“What do you rent on?”
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you didn't notice.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it's really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and re-painted, sunk, etc.?
The boats are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would still be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates.
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...

Marine Le Pen is not right.
Populism?
There is no other truth than that which reveals the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
Increasing wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 Mass will be said!
Capitalism will not become impoverished.
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies, so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food, so our food, with the care structures, so our health, with our debts, so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this to the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese of the money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Minister of Economy of Rothschild Bank, to better defend the interests of the banksters, who were solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no other competing?
What do you call it: turning his jacket, dropping his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
In fact, we don’t know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was swelling at the beginning of the day; I don’t know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Likewise, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, the Falklands, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, you can see a calm sea in daylight.
In addition, the rescuers knew that at this stage there were no more German fighters in the area.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick Wikipedia search:
There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two battleship cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they ceased firing, and a pursuit race began.
The Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he got closer he saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nuremberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, leaning and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his spotlight on the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened the fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee found that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped searching at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he set out to the north.
So, if this is true, the Germans, tapping in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they fled to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and had cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
A number of votes have been cast at the UMP requesting that it be enshrined in the law that an elected official who is definitively condemned be therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a brave position, which would also affect left-wing elected officials, of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED A REGISTRATION TO THE WALL OF THE CONS OF THE MAGISTRATS
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to sweeten those who will take advantage of their immovability to obstruct the actions of real politicians, who really try to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is to the extent of their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little banners" money for justice" they came from the province and didn't make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of their party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing, or even far-right, unions were targeting personalities on its side and waging a legal-media war against them.
Your statements are totally free.
If, at present, the right is defying the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that show it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice, but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not received favorable treatment.
On the other hand, it must also be recalled that the left-wing judiciary union is not the only judiciary union and is in the minority.
That a minister supports unions with so much commitment shows just how useful they can be.
<0x40>MCR The union you are quoting may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence in the Chancellery is great, it’s no secret.
The question now arises whether the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than instructing.
<0x40>gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is in the minority.
What are you complaining about?
<0x40>Pivaine: You forget that the magistrates are not officials like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to indict and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most fame-hungry fool realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fills stadiums all over the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is among the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens to most of the stars who don’t participate in the contests anyway.
There are few who, after one tube, manage to make others.
Anyway, most singers/bands can at best expect three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it’s more likely to end up on a career than the typical rock journey, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar frizzers who smoke grass in their father’s garage and swing three chords on a poem elementary school level will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples – a distance that quickly turns into racism, because sacralistic ethnologists present these distant people to us as infinitely superstitious and petrified with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours, and inspired, as ours.
Except you interpret it recklessly in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is like a reminder to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined and circumscribed object in the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It's ephemeral deco to furnish the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacredness still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw into the nettles not at all scientific interpretations that last the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative criticism of disciplines to make a joke?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before archaeologists relied on their “instinct” and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Nowadays we have technical and scientific means so efficient that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can still be challenged by other discoveries!
We are here in full (and old) controversy about the shamanism advanced by the prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The shamans of prehistory", especially the augmented re-issue of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article.
Do Straight Men Love Anal Sex?
For you, Mike, I could do it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we go on with three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on this.
We couldn’t watch a musical on the other hand, it would be too gay!
We could expect to have that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, brave journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than making fun of these childish ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go away, then.
If these "children's ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless, the amateur video of the crash can be found on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no way those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers it would have released the safety car at the time or another vehicle (e.g. troublemaker) entered the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not deem it good to advance the time of departure (TV right, pub, money...).
Other than that, they protect the pilots.
Of course, I agree with that view as well.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have the restart a chance to beat the English who led then...
On this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it doesn't matter, I have a little time to find out all your shit.
No, just no.
There have been lots of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of the possibility of winning one driver to the detriment of another.
It’s not the FOM that releases safety because it’s the FIA.
Shade of size.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of image mainly allows the FIA to avoid annoying questions such as: How is it that the commissioner waves a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because we clearly see one of the commissioners waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is no longer under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misunderstanding of F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag regime AFTER the place of the accident, hence the green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The post of police officers just downstream of the accident (as the case may be, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume normal pace.
Sensationalism sells ads.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid that in the end it’s just for the money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information that we really don’t need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so they can keep controlling them.
“When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear” It should be “derailing,” not “coughing.”
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “derailing.”
I wonder if all the people who are terrified that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they are now believing in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist.
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that nicely and solidly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
I’m depressed that the media talks about most things with that optimism upside down.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without getting to hysteria) so that the government can get us out of the way when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that if we have to undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from the crises that it has invented itself.
Isn’t there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to still be of this world almost 35 years later.
It must have been awful at first, given the context of the 1980s and 1990s.
I’m bluffing, living with the certainty of spending there for years .....
Absolutely useless testimony.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective appraisal of the facts.
<0x40>trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we refrain from asking psychiatric patients questions when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her stepmother.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's nonsense, it's a subjective testimony of no importance.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of the new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
So what do you base your research on?
About fantasies?
Are you putting on the same level fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the fake word admired by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think of themselves as great psychologists after reading D'Ansembourg.
<0x40>Jim: There are plenty of empty buzzwords in psychics.
Cyrulnik gave us the blow of “resilience”.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has crafted us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and Company?
Doesn't it remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it is *not* a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
And why, then?
It was a great series and it looks like those who come out are aware of it!
Let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to make the kids hang?
The only solution that comes to mind is the pee-caca humour, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's series.
The children were hanging.
Because it's a children's series?
UKIP works for the Mysteries.
Keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if you do not see the threads and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to rebroadcast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; we have had one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m. for at least 40 years.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can still see it at these times.
And in addition, half-hour episodes now pass at 5:30 a.m., from Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the Esplanade Mosque!!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations under and around the Esplanade Mosque for several decades have failed to find anything.
The Temple Mount if it exists it is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosque esplanade was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, this is Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remind it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and scorched it continuously!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize His own?
The shortest Jewish joke: “Glory be to God!”
To praise tourism in Israel, we are often shown half-undressed young naïads, languid on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what the advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
It is a pity that the Reuters photographer did not take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to go back to the Temple Mount and who prefer to peck Jewish faithful below, praying at the Wall of Lamentation.
<0x40>Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is right, it is not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that we must condemn.
This system is not durable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to be going wild, big companies have profited enormously from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater pay to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of groaning and groaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also show your employer that you don't fuck people with impunity.
Unless democracy is abandoned, in which case it is sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this cannot end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that kept it going.
Have you voted for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
It sounds unbelievable, but that’s exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have to our lives.
Independent Guardian World Development Movement is only recently beginning to talk about it in the media, so look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
Didn’t Churchill say “blood, sweat, and tears”?
These are great benefits, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the eighteenth there were unions in all the regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (well, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe herself to be the safe of France’s eternal values, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if it's more and more uncomfortable for her...
They still miss you the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write French correctly, I'm unionizing.
You're warned, it'll be your fault.
In order to defend the interests of the class, protected trade unions are already suffering enough, which has created a break in equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh at the fear of risk on the part of an official.
We can very well imagine a system that guarantees a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or otherwise without the right to strike, as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster assured.
And with the carts getting ready, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject commented here...
Let's delete "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 constitution.
He said, “8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of enterprises.
This is absolutely indispensable with the outbreak of information power.
And yet you opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically entitled “The Great British Bake Off review”.
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding that I watched, and I can tell you that some of them have been seasoned well.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones !
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely enough, the show ends with a victory for the least-worst baker; no one has done like, "Boom, here's my fucking cake now puff it up and bow to your master!"
Perhaps the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside has finally had an effect on them?
In previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And there’s also the idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears last week.
I like to cook, but I can’t imagine inflicting this on myself.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus provide us with great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Go ahead for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to tinker one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to separate, I don’t know how they were able to choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the somewhat dry base (although I agree with Hollywood that the green glaze on Richard's mill wasn't craving, anyway Richard had already lost at the time).
I have to admit that several of the challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time spent.
There is also cancer waiting, with the solar wind blows.
Certainly, everything succeeds for us right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to "drive" the ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancers”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If we are limited to humans, they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to warm ourselves (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and releases UVAs and most UVBs.
Do you know that you don’t have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor to be a stayer when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor clarification that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Not to mention that I am a regular of melanoma, UVs only accelerate its development.
They do not provoke it.
As a proof, not all people who are tanned have melanoma.
Or, when a toubib tells you to avoid the sun and live in the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for any human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything else: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that anything can be folded if enough strength is applied and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a front-line communication hardware.
But for us,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested in it have established that anything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth folding joke I read in the comments today.
It’s hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and we do not see how it could get back to it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS was not installed correctly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on all of them?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of an FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
Oh the article for Bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrials produce in 'industrial' We highlight super u but all the signs and meme the small business are concerned How to eat good, bio avac 1650€ (average salary in france)?
But to respond to your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
Everyone is free to set their priorities wherever they want.
For me, the food is one.
Go without resentment, I kiss you
They are called bobos, or rather boboécolos, people who see the world through ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from realities.
This is total thought-reason unbundling.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example pretending to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartufery, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartufery also don't be surprised to often encounter criticism about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecoles are monobloc.
Have you understood the concept of left-caviar?
Well, you are able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
This is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecolos at all.
The boboecolo is one of them but represents only the most visible fringe of ecolos because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, nobody wants to look at this giraffe in front of you.
It is so badly done that it looks vaguely like a feminine nude.
Shut up, you're next to the plate.
One must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin doesn't know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
This is *art*.
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
This is not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs who smoke while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is more than just representing the real.
If you are looking for just that, a camera will do the job.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still a lot of savings: riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer on active duty.
Honesty forces us to say that France is decreasing its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses and inadequacies of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
<0x40>edmond: that’s what I said, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it’s really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
Let all those who have had little or no side with the military thing dare come here and say, with their eyes in the eyes, that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without breaking out of laughter...
Applying the same potion to the public service as a whole and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really loud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why La Défense can feel a little busy!
Well, the savings on which everyone agrees that they have to be done, it has to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at murder when it happens at home, poor darling.
It should be done, but especially that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How can closing the Valley of Grace weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself at every closure of post offices, maternity hospitals, hospitals and barracks.
Everyone is for savings, of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn't rejoice in savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I have ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It’s depressing to scroll through his Facebook feed and see that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they're going to make a movie of it.
He will surely rely on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus while going to work and only realizes that his skirt has returned to his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely silly.
Not really, in my opinion, the author takes on the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to hide his emotions and to grind his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence has been something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don’t have the “internet.”
So I don't think I can comment.
Having no computer.
Oh, my God, I have to watch this movie before I die!
I can't believe how this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really just demonstrated that he is at the very top of the cosmic universe that satirical journalism is!
I'm falling for it!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible glow and the insurmountable genius that emanates from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, my God, it was really bad.
Especially if they are not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play the tartuffs at every meeting to save the planet.
So we, citizens, decide to take matters into our own hands.
With the Commissioner they have planted on energy, all these beautiful recommendations have gone away ....

Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the entire sector is not controlled, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions from production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity by renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittent.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PV would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am a State Doctor of Physics 1981 plus I did research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the contrary of what I said.
For what I did not say it is you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany nothing in fact you did not respond to what I said and as all people on the right to demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and ineffective way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the steam greenhouse gases of lesser effect than CO2 it is true recall two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant part in steam and a little in river water.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a "giant of South Asia"...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
Not surprisingly, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandora full of corruption and mafia.
As for the ISL, today’s opening game was surprisingly interesting, with the Kolkata Athletic standing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India spends on IPL cricket and now on football, how could we ever compete with our “noisy neighbors”...
The low cost launcher race pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect manifests itself only with a helium that is too cold.
So we may not be in a design flaw, but in implementation...
Unlike arianespace which is a private company, it seems that soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer.
They may be paying for the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more unfortunate as many media take over the titles of articles alone in a loop - and that many readers only remember these titles.
Overall, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
I totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project when it is just a launcher problem.
