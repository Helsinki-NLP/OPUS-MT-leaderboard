The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India’s new Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third-largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
India is also reportedly hoping for a defense cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrested 20-Year-Old for Fast Motorcycle Hunt
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape from the police in Bilbara.
Traffic officers in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before departing to the bushland, where the officers lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person who matched the driver's description were later seen at a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accuse a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop signal and ruthless driving.
He is scheduled to appear before the local court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, read the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The indictment is that Webster attacked her while she was “unconscious, asleep, and could not signal consent.”
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reconsideration of the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of unions as a civil right.
“Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That’s why I’m proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act together with civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities in cases of discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination – and stops anti-union forces.
Supplementing the national labour law to provide an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a trade union representation, to sue a civil court for justice - and to obtain damages or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill suggest is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks trade unions have faced in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and uphold labor rights.
There was a time millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to pass a constitution to ensure that militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that workers and their unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that “the workers’ rights to union and collective bargaining and action are guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict or aim to diminish this right shall be null and void; measures aimed at it shall be unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, which designed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union should then be allowed to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - should be protected.
After these rights have come under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to reconsider the American ideal that the working population must have the right to unite and make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, labor has miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily halts law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say would have allegedly led to the closure of all five of the state’s abortion clinics.
This measure, lifted to law by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and due to come into effect on Sept. 1, would force doctors performing abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius for their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors may continue to carry out legal abortions temporarily while requesting such a right.
“The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they strive to obtain these rights,” Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
A hearing for the judge is scheduled within one month to bring about a more durable decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures, and said doctors could have so much more time to gain hospital admission rights.
“Today’s decision means that women in Louisiana are escaping a sneaky law that wants to take away their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chair of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics, who did not join the lawsuit and had also applied for the right of instruction.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the state’s remaining clinics to close were halted by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that instructional rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Abortion opponents argue that the measures are designed to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient identification rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights reported.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation out of fear for his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the ruling, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their requests for patient referral rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video tribute to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analyzed medical data from more than 1,100 Australian women who had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
Researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined women’s medical care over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing diseases, and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had already advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedical services to counter the distances, she suggested as a possible remedy a strengthening of the service of inflight doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women more densely at their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic status, the study revealed a poor long-term survival rate in women with ovarian cancer and underscored the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret declining homeowner numbers
The decline, coupled with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers, according to a study by HTA, reach the “nuclear age group for garden products,” as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says renters spend an average of 55 percent of the amount people spend on their gardens with a home.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting gardens for parking purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors threatening the industry where an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion is implemented in sales annually.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent over a six-year period, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that renting homes or small gardens does not mean that people cannot plant plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for RHS, said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to rising homeowner numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also forecast an improved market situation for this year due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, about 1,000 protesters stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but is now sending again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away, they clashed with security forces equipped with sticks and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but Sharif rejected it.
The country’s army, meanwhile, urges a political solution to the conflict “without wasting time and using violence.”
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already couped more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in last May’s parliamentary election.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to enter Sharif’s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomat for espionage report
Turkey’s foreign ministry has summoned the country’s most senior U.S. diplomats for information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the US embassy chief executive and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the reports by former U.S. analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major area of activity for the U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that also targeted the most important intelligence service in Germany, Ankara, led to significantly more angry reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: locomotive drivers threaten to have consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the locomotive drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
Announced for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., the stoppage affects all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.

said the district chairman of the trade union of German locomotive drivers (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimize the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to foresee the consequences in concrete terms.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
Prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the office of the Mallorcan prosecutor on Friday.
The chief of police of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested on corruption charges by businessmen and bar owners at the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro has been detained on corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the office of the prosecutor for anti-corruption of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are interrogated by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners testified that the authorities’ cousin economy had a serious impact on their businesses.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about surviving,” one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihood out of play.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who carried out Fellatio on 24 men during a drinking tour.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the unlawful behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-soaked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the felatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage jointly have to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several alcohol-influenced accidents, including the trend of balconing, where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING gave South Australia a wintery surprise, with violent thunderstorms and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m., another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen at night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy thunderstorms, including a casting that started just before 8 p.m. and provided nearly 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After winter last week provided an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell back to a peak of just 15.8°C on Monday.
The bumpy weather conditions probably led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to launch through.
Wind gusts reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to start again during a second landing approach and finally set off at about 8.40 p.m.
The flight delay subsequently resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
Adelaide is expected to reach a high temperature of 16°C on Tuesday, with chance of thunderstorms.
Matthies says: Highest time for big networking
In view of the rapid technological advancement that threatens to transform our cozy home into high-tech power stations, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my glance falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there’s a thought behind it: If the cable weren’t there, all listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be even more retro.
Anyway, it applies to the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typo: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And whoever still has a tube TV in the living room today, for example, simply says that he basically rejects television.
Why these thoughts?
Because the pushing of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The layman, who used to blindly master washing machines and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread with incredibly vain expert speech before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us.
Yeah, you're still okay?
What should we talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such a quark?
Basically, for about 20 years, it’s mainly about networking our house.
So that the yogurt itself can be re-ordered, so that the fire detector informs us during our holidays in the Maldives that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn’t it be wonderful if we left the office air conditioning on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true soon: we lift our wristwatch, say it loudly "sucking!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner starts.
I'm mad.
Everything turns out to nothing less than a revolution: "The borders between white and brown goods are blurred," a industry expert ruminates, you can connect the washing machine to a headset, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza still needs in the oven, which does not help because we are in traffic jams.
From daily practice, we also know that when a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air protection rooms as rocket and mortar shelling descended on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and schools in Gaza remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The school launch brought a sense of joy and expectation to the rocket-drawn communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed before the arrival of pupils of grenade fragments from the walls and sliding walls.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of the Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt “a bit weird” to suddenly go back to school.
“That was a difficult time, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke out last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza, heavily marked by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that your knowledge acquires and provides you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire prompted an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ call for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel denies these data and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but has not provided any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
As tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and the fighting continues, education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
“I hope the school will be open again soon so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vice Strobl calls into question NPD prohibition proceedings
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU Federal Deputy Thomas Strobl has opted for an end to the ongoing NPD prohibition proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
According to CDU Federal Vice-President Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is performing worse than last time," Strobl, who is also CDU head of state in Baden-Württemberg, told the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasing development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NDP is being fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed in the vote on Sunday very close to the five-percent hurdle.
A first call for a ban on the far-right party failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection had informants in the NDP at the time.
In December 2013, after long preparations, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the Newcomers’ Square, refugees are now housed in tents.
The Central First Hospital for Refugees in Harburg bursts out of all seams.
Now the Home Office has set up three Red Cross tents next to it.
The district politicians were briefed only shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to stimulate reservations from citizens and give district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party is demanding that the Harburg District Administration currently provide unused homes for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the first reception are the rush of people seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s research director, Tim Lawless, said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
RP Data figures show that home prices in Sydney rose 16.1 percent last year, compared to 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose on average by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless said that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in properties for sale over the next few months, which would subject the market to “a real test.”
“Given the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of managing director Peer Medau and attests to him as "positive as a field lord".
This is not the style of the university, the statement said.
In mid-June, the Medau family had already been verbally informed about the start of the university.
The statement that the plans were not made known until July is definitely wrong,” Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preliminaries or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which was necessary for access, was also less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
There was and is no mention of a nine-metre-wide road.
At the current level, it is 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will then only be used by students of the university in the future does not allow Pötzl to apply.
Parking is not possible at all, because this can now be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the locals
The Kinderkrippe Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and at whose front door the access to the park deck would lead, should not be "affected".
Instead, he points out, "that this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the mouth of Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring Realschule.
So it’s about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau,” says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the Parental Advisory Board of the Kinderkrippe, with the expansion of the street, would be entitled to lose one of the few natural spots of Coburg, "can the reader decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Office Bamberg, intends to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and in this context to address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau informed the parents of the nursery about the university’s plans last week.
Accordingly, the access for the new park deck should not be via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but via the Medau-Berg.
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be double-tracked over about a kilometer.
According to estimates of the Medaus, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would be tenfold.
There are about 2,000 vehicles per day.
So far, the city has not wanted to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt mentioned health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured for several months.
It’s time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team,” the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
He thus enters international retirement with a record of 167 national matches and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the throwing back room player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on a goal hunt for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his squad for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they will inspire my many years of fellow players and my successors.
But for my club I want to be healthy in the next few years, for this, longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-hander had to fear his career end in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortison injection, which later had triggered severe inflammation.
An emergency surgery and two more procedures followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career go by no body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries, which took place at short intervals in 2012, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
This involves some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I realized that while I can control my head, my body cannot deceive," Glandorf explained in an interview with the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes tear, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time family father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, I would like to be able to go at least somewhat straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and winning the 2014 Champions League, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he secured the European Cup of Cup Winners with Flensburg.
German economy shrank by 0.2% in spring
The crises around the world slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office, confirming provisional calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, a total GDP increase of 0.8% compared to the second half of 2013 was achieved for the first half of the year.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmann town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterland-Mooiste".
It is the largest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour of the Münsterland.
Published in various journals, this tour was offered to interested parties.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists rejoiced about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the club house of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the wall, where the start also took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued towards Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On tracks of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were cared for on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer, Jos ter Huerne, and the deputy mayor, Heinz Lölfing, were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We were very pleased and it was a great experience for everyone involved.
The organization went smoothly and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing concludes positively.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see you again in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on August 30 or during another weekend", the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Weckers ruthlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, politically assured activist, ex-prisoner, has put to paper in 287 pages in "Monk and Warrior".
Not chronologically, but more thought fists for thought fists, the Municher born on 1 June 1947 wrote his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a matching song text.
And he is ruthlessly honest: from the onanie as a high school student to the theft of shops and drug use, he does not leave out any human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also assumes abstract but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how not only music has shaped him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his imprisonment.
The latter has also brought the living man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary."
But there are also short anecdotes about the earth among all the high-spirited views: for example, about fights in a local frequented by GIs or a mad car ride where he targeted a tree frontally.
He is ruthlessly honest, too.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Hear up with the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton – who had grown up when I was a child – went with him into the pub and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry at Dudley, and though the conditions were better than in his father's days, he gained insight into what life might have been like for him.
It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, smoky, deeply stylish mazes with flames and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could hear him slowly as he started singing because he was able to wash the foundry off.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents’ testimonies of love.
My father never hugged me, he never said, "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mom went bad towards the end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very obese and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been captured by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his busy working life.
He started at the age of 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage as he imitated people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow big in front of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to perform at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a lightweight entertainment program in which people "painted black," Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I somehow wish it never happened, but I don’t regret doing it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years-long award-winning lightweight pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures that mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first row of the Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertisements, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv he thought, "What do you do next, Len, because it all feels like you're just putting the time around or stepping a little bit on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, whites in tights and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Don't do it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recorded 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could make it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
“That’s what it’s all about, it’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a bit.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, 'You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they're fixing the computer.'"
Instead, the stage director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
This also came well, so it's like a big shield of the gods who tell me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a telling voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love it.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is filled with humorous outbursts, while he always imitates people.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you're driving it out to a wall.
I sometimes perform live at Apollo if I want to, but overall it doesn’t give me as much as I used to.
I ask him if he will ever go on a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give it up again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block streets in Yemen’s capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthi have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party said "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the Yemen Post newspaper, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on Sunday evening for the measures.
Huthi threatened to escalate the conflict further if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demanding the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has besieged the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the main access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are repeated bloody fights with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to curb 'spirit workers'
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to remove “spirit workers” from the government’s salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salaries even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service at his inauguration in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month was lost in payments to “spirit workers” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects salaries will continue to be paid to accounts after a person dies or leaves public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure their data is recorded on biometric registrations, a government message said.
Anyone who would not do so without a credible excuse would be removed from the salary list, the statement continued.
"Through this approach, it will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also purifying the salary list at both levels of government - thus the "spirit workers" will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal about art consultant Helge Achenbach will be tried for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are claiming €19.4 million in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in bankruptcy proceedings.
This was announced by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach had cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and Berthold Albrecht charged higher purchase prices than actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school for 44 years, 23 of them as headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many confessed Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as pupils.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his pursuit of seeing the human being in the pupil.
The Snowkope is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
Already at the age of 14, he became interested in the teacher profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudetendeutsche were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp we went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
So it swallowed up Richter in the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
Teacher education took place in Bamberg.
For this purpose, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometers a week to the nearest station, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping facility in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he made the first and in 1954 after three years of teaching the second state exam.
Since Upper Franconia did not have a free teaching position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and arrived at the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Miss Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher’s house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were combined in Petershausen in today’s town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the elementary school remained in the place.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to take up the current building from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had built a workspace and cellar rooms at the municipal expense of the expansion in 1997, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Judge recalled gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government official who had responded to a lecture from a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard there as a young teacher.
“You have to give children two things: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: "It doesn't always succeed." Whether he only meant his pupils or his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Richter’s actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students beat each other, they did not get a penal work from him, nor were they forced to sit back.
At the expense of the municipality, Judge had purchased two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was a violet.
For the good of the school, judges as rector maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the non-partisan judge to run for the municipal council in 1996, at least as the last one on the CSU list.
Judges were nominated for sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scotland
If cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, that is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of rests alone made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour with accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Schotten Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Biking and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were greeted by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started biking in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Lower Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, dumpling, spreading and cheese cakes, which gave wonderful mouths to the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only be baked by rural women," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
At the drink stand of the gym Geiß-Nidda cold refreshments could be obtained.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already re-attached broken chains of bicycles today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking-cure house by reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Promotion manager Tobias Hagen, who had been there as a tour leader since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, could only nap for a short time, because he had a lot to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-member Hesse police motorcycle squad using three phones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia cyclists have traveled.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available overnight capacity.
In category I, participants will be accommodated in hotels, in category II in group accommodations.
The cyclists had a good impression of the spa, when they left after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved farewell.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were demanded in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive ambience and of course they had prepared treats, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whitener.
The visitors were greeted by Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hossfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as member of the Management Board of the ADAC Hesse-Thüringen.
The three were clearly pleased with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move vibrantly in the open air was used eagerly despite the sporting activity on the bike.
Increasingly among the guests were citizens, who were as fond of the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day the cyclists had the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for 'conspiracy' against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local media agencies say.
The police authorities did not give any immediate comment.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly establishing an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister) described their actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people’s front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of the school in Slavyansk, who visited Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She arrives with a proud tow of fame from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
She has her own frontal experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., whereupon she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top position of the parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Her compensation was reportedly nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political rankings are also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became Cabinet Advisor.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
Already in May I described the office of the president with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of one’s own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and uneasiness when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopol, which demands a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new president would risk taking on everything and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps killing himself in the process.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn’t enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC shrink – power, money, and status outdated.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, convenient securities, the forthcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC poses special dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys into the certainly largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently, the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone these days and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry of Texas Says Decreasing Tweet Was Unauthorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a degrading remark about the Democratic District Attorney, who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one from Perry's user account that dropped the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
“I don’t approve of the tweet and I deleted it,” the tweet read.
Perry staff did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although the tweets from Perry’s official user account ran out, it wasn’t clear who actually served the feed.
The previous tweet drew an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of driving drunk in April 2013.
Perry filed a veto against financial support for her office when she refused to step down, leading to an indictment against Perry — who could possibly be a 2016 presidential candidate — before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet reads, “I don’t always drive drunk with the triple permissible level of alcohol ... but when I do, I’ll sue Governor Perry when he chats it out.”
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg’s office was not responsible for the Grand Jury’s investigation of Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-class team of lawyers asked the judge entrusted with the case to dismiss the charge, arguing that the law prosecuting the state’s oldest governor in the history of Texas is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the state’s public integrity unit — which is based in Travis County and investigated in cases of state corruption in Texas — when Lehmberg refused to give up.
This veto led to a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa elections during his 2012 presidential run, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market 'normal' again
One of London’s most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in southeastern England had “returned” to normal.
Homes in the capital were coveted and subject to enormous price increases, prompting the Bank of England to set mortgage ceilings in June due to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-end construction company Berkeley, said on Monday, “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013,” adding that this provides a “stable environment for action.”
The London real estate market was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers were pushing into the capital.
According to the cadastral office, prices in the city area jumped 18.5 percent last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average sales prices at Berkeley’s private, low-cost and student offerings rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "village tax" before the general elections next May.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which introduced tighter lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday shows a decline in mortgage allowances in July, which also suggests the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in London real estate prices for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on an already weakening real estate price awareness.
Transaction volumes in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington have now declined by a quarter year after year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due for futures sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, deadline sales also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April – nearly one-third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million annually, sales by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a statement Monday ahead of the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley this year would be expected to match current market expectations.
Analysts consistently estimate the annual pre-tax result to be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley stocks stood at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in London trade in the afternoon.
Jennifer Lawrence nude photos posted by hackers on the internet
Jennifer Lawrence at the 85th Academy Awards.
Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and accused the hacker of "blatant violation of privacy".
Authorities have been notified and will track all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a gap in Apple’s online storage system iCloud. The alleged “master list” of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It’s not certain how many of the images are genuine, though Winstead, a star from “Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World” on Twitter, also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you are really satisfied with yourself," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeons series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied, however, that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted, "These so-called nude pictures of me are FASHIONED, folks.
Let's start with the beginnings. *Word game intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late on Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They broke out, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved up like a cardboard box left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distanced, and perhaps a little scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
Scratch-brush he knew.
He was stingy, like in hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim of this stinginess was a just-beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief from the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly tender beauty with untamed hair and a flickering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion, whom Kevern considered her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a moist but paradise valley with the fitting name Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaked, in the baths were still spiders, naked snails had left their traces on all the windows and believed that all this belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had liked to sit with Ailinn on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and had enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had clung away in the service console, which provided the country with calming music and soothing messages, when the sight of their crossed old brown legs had long forgotten him.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolete, just like the word obsolete.
The general taste achieved what decrees and regulations would never have achieved, and just as people chose from plate-washing to millionaire memoirs, cookbooks, and love novels in books, so they chose ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a roughly funny serenade of Ailinn’s big feet.
Ailinn didn’t understand that.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very funny game then, and it wasn’t very funny now.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of anyone.
Jazz was not played, even though it was not directly forbidden.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single “when” in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
The same is true of the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he turned 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn’t have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were, as if by nature, blessed with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had not quickly left the country when WHAT WAS Happened – out of fear of being charged with firing, even out of fear that the flames would consume them next – had opened Labneh and Shisha whistle-restaurants and stopped with unactivity.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could ever be interpreted.
Music was an expression of love.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the giant coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why should your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in their presence.
She already thought he was a little strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in unbelief and blocked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see in the whole world but her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
“If you say it,” she said without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Not your feet so directly.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted there.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to, Kevern, be that.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Solomon’s Ailin turned red and got up from her deck chair, threw down the console, and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like a palm-weed in a storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I feel perverted to you," she said.
Except that I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary inconvenience of his words and because of the fear that was manifested in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more suspicious than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn't watch out!
They first kiss -- kissing was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter-poison to the nonsensical love ballads from the console -- first kissing them and then beating them.
In Kevern’s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the crunching itself was already an act of violence.
Ailin Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He stood up from the chair like an old man.
She also felt bleeding, but the strength of his grief surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him walk away—as if from a room on the upper floor her companion were watching him—a man complaining about something he himself had sworn up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bending his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, when she could not remember a single time she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon’s feet.
Several years before the just-reported events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public sentiment, had been invested in a short lecture on continued violence at low and medium levels in precisely the parts of the country where its reduction, if not abolition, had been the most likely to be the most likely to be in money.
“Much has already been done, and much still needs to be done,” she wrote, “to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been rarely felt despite the high-rising church towers between the hedges.
But some properties turn out to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less passion it continues to awaken.
The population weeps while listening to sentimental ballads, gets drunk with stories of overcome difficulties, and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless not only the former rawness holds the rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in the hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and deceitful dispute at home on the streets, even on the streets and on the streets.
“You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate,” her mentor said after reading the whole report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nutbaum lowered her head.
I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme appealed to her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
- Feminist?
Silence again.
“I don’t ask that,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “because I would be against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is a non-prejudice workplace.
We serve a society without prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can occasionally distort results, as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "insidious" and "raw" could just as well be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to ride around what is happening when it is happening, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away the land’s essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, declare, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence; the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to say," replied Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice, when she was certain that her superior had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we have not yet healed as effectively as we pretend ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that lead to WHAT IS AT ALL, WHEN IT IS.
But this time it’s not the others where we let go of our anger and suspicion.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To signify an angelic patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “if you describe actions as ‘mistakes’ that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You also go too far when you talk about them omitting their “angry” and “distrust” of “others.”
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past as in protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “other”.
There was no “we” and there was no “other.”
It was a time of turmoil, that's all we know.
"Of which, if we are honest with ourselves," dared Esme to inject, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened has happened.
That was back then.
There is no need to say anything about this - we agree.
And just as no guilt has to be attributed, no guilt has to be abolished if such a repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to repay it.
But what does the past serve if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I can say anything about it -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and fired her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who, as passersby described, had walked on the path in a kind of "brutal anger".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup was planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officials in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government and said they were taking action against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said the country’s army had surrounded his office and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting on threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was de facto no coup, but that the military was reacting to the threat of “political fanatics” whose arming was imminent by the police.
“What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defense Forces Staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that within the police there are some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were on the verge of doing devastating damage,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a overthrow.
"While no one has claimed to have seized the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defense Forces have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
A spokesman for the Lesotho military said on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the leadership during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become the target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There have been major tensions in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to clashes in his united government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite accusations that were different.
Eurozone production at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to its lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely watched study.
The final Markit Procurement Manager Index of the Manufacturing Industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced collapses at a time of escalating tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will arrive ahead of the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and for the imminent deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information over the course of this week, whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the eurozone, in line with those made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
“Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers have become more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second-largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as is the decline of Italy from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism in Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer applicable is also not reassuring,” said Mr. Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say for the Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Manager Index of August is that the sector will continue to grow afterwards.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone seem to find life quite difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions – especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine – increase uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy – in particular, and consumer confidence – and are likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, in particular large orders.
He said it would be "ever more likely" that the ECB would eventually need to initiate some kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The decade of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children entangled in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death in the atrocities in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the appalling siege of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East in aversion, and then turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death in the atrocities in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now plaguing Ukraine - and in which children like them die - now comes to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the smashed school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried to climb back into the smashed school sports hall in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Totally confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
They were both thought dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said at the time.
My legs were full of blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday said: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need to have surgery again.
Some grenade shards are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people, as she was helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says fightily.
“That happened to me, and you can’t change it.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory gets slightly weaker every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself climbing back to school online, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe, and help prevent it from happening again.
The boy who fled through the bullet hail, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearful that she might be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed him by the hand and fled through a bullet hail.
His father, Vladimir, who hugged his son outside, said, "That's why I told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and had leg injuries in the hospital, in turn believing that her son had died.
After her reunification she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now disbanded newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering,” he said yesterday.
But I can say that it gets bleaker in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right afterwards.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard who didn’t make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a top open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who last week volunteered in a monastery.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I still remember how Damir liked to eat Borshch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot them with his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war now continues, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just kids like ours.
I think for many war is part of the news they hear when bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past abominations.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, his face away from us, for hours.
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can’t believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I recovered after the explosion and got on my legs, I looked around, and looked at hell around me, with body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
“I remember calling him, ‘Dame, run, run away,’ but I was also so sure he hadn’t heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrific image after the siege became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, to the right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was marked by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had put him off for his first day of school before she rushed off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
“I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three horrible days,” she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I mean it happened yesterday, some scenes from these days keep following me.
No one will ever forget, I promise.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn’t like to see the picture, and it’s hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People are constantly examining such tragedies and never knowing the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing in such pain.
It takes us tens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the sports hall when September 1st approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won’t forget, but I don’t feel sorry.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and attended a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgij Fanijev, 20
The boy who survived despite being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgiy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
“We feel like it was yesterday,” says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but couldn’t do it because of his health damage due to the siege.
It’s still with me, it’s nothing I’ve left behind.
I’m older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences – I have to say that’s not true.
“In 2006 I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better afterwards, but I can’t forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 – the year after – was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please don’t ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgiy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB’s Academy of Intelligence in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my kids about my experiences.
Children should not know about this and they should of course not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It must be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn’t there.
I waited for him at home and couldn’t help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me, and here in Beslan are all of them.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It’s hard to accept when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several times, he can walk but does not exercise.
I would say that he has overcome the horror 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and this only intensifies my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and loved.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart weeps for those killed.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby so poignantly carried in safety by a special operations command
Rescued: Aljona Tskajeva is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world held its breath in 2004 when baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty they kept their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
“They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man Accused of Overcoming Girl on Pedestrian Crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man stands trial for crossing a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl at Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, dismisses the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC began the proceedings for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shot like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and shooting modes that optimize exposure time for the muted underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and ratings for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s difficult to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a row mode that takes a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Walk close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor lighting conditions.
It is especially important when working with an action camera: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As a consultant anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving the sick from both the agony of the disease and the pains of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that diagnoses and illnesses were important to the doctors, while those treated were mostly busy with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel,” he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble catching up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he impatiently blamed his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather have everything immediately than later," he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and for no reason worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been in the French Alps for skiing.
The result of the X-ray examination was present.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest skin, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers before.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos exposure - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a condition that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily pledged to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another era, it seems scarcely worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the peak of a mesolthelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the houses we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we learn in, and the shops we shop in.
And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament buildings are asbestos polluted.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healed, we have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I had completed my training for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to at least partially answer this question.
“Of the four doctors trained at Guy’s Hospital who have suffered from mesothelioma in the last five years,” he wrote in a 2010 letter, “I am the last one still alive.”
How many of us will get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17th of this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of mesotheliosis sufferers die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will still get sick?”
The UK’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to stop, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have died.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A brief look at the court records, to which those affected often turn for claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma has already spread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer admitted to Janice Allen’s negligent exposure to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations, one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and WHO to be a “great health risk” with a possible death toll.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokydolith).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates.”
A Marks & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He presented a study of those affected, which states that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure from work or in the home were presumably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, could have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be whirled up by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of work will have to be spent over several years to renovate the parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, the deputies will be more likely to meet the green center.
The Goddard report also noted that "the presence of asbestos was not handled according to the respective regulations."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were decided positively,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked on, and the data.
What he still remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a fever.
He was 45 and had surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make the trip home any more.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the chestbone, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Amazed doctors took X-rays of his chest and applied pleural catheters to draw fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, an Abbotts patient with similar symptoms came to his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his GP brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cave between the rib and chest fur.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
Honestly, I hadn’t worried so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year’s Eve: “I was told it was mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
It was only now that he understood the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos,” he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting sick.
And this is how mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war hospitals were potentially life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students placed their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
It is not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools as well.
In fact, many people may have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have placed their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
Asbestos is often mentioned in schools on websites.
And in the meantime, such innocent items in our homes as floor slabs or shelving roofs have included asbestos by default.
“It’s an industrial poison that’s included in much of our properties,” Andrew Morgan, the attorney who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital, notes.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So take care how to tear down your garden sheds.
The impact of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I spent two weeks in practice.
Then I knew I had to leave and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
The biggest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to cope with.
“It was very hard to take it all,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long do I have?’
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-sustaining mechanism – breathing itself – that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the chest fur, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest fur and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were also presumably exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the very beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work as well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, hotly controversial.
Some think it is worth a try.
Treasure denies it.
"You can't cut the chest fur out," he says.
They don't get around it with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect", but does not heal.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” Treasure says.
In the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and counseling office for fellow patients.
"Hi, cancer center," he presented himself cheerfully when calling.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott had originally been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and were expected to extend his life by just one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a cardiac thorax specialist at Guy's.
“We had an advantage in not having to be referred, I just called and got an appointment,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a referral and would have to wait for approval of treatment.
Money is critical for mesothelioma patients to be able to perform the best therapies available.
But if these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that even a very low burden posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled her case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "full compensation," as Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact on Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, however, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibers were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation, it is an enormous problem to attribute the lethal contact of asbestos to a company or workplace — usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is right for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there were clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to sue for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have attributed to them in a normal damages lawsuit - about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications to the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma sufferers that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million was a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal from insurers to insurers,” he says, suggesting that this amount is a quarter of what insurers would have paid if time hadn’t gone by and mesothelioma patients could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths, quick action was needed every day.
“People suffer so much and need help today,” Penning said during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which he expects to have a positive effect unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt stronger.
“Of course, that’s with the most important thing,” Abbott says.
This is always seen in patients.
There is something that keeps you going.
When you quit, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had the last of six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
After-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is very physically and psychologically exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm gone, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn’t grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and stubborn.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioms, such conversations are not permeated by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as it does for Stephen Jay Gould in the end) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament ruled against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election by the Hong Kong electorate.
This is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress basically allows communist leaders to reject all unfaithful candidates.
"It's not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said law expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, said the admission of public nominations in the elections would be too “chaotic” for the Hong Kong government.
Since 1997, when Britain handed over control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have residents elect the presidency from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is keeping the process firmly in hand through a closely-controlled Beijing nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates will be admitted "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong’s biggest and most publicly active protests in many years took place.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine general right to vote.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong within hours of the announcement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and were planning waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday there were tightened security measures outside the government building, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is compounded by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases the competition for products and services.
In addition, fears are growing that Hong Kong values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement, as they endangered business operations – Hong Kong’s lifeline.
“The protests they’re talking about could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they last,” said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong will get out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media has also recently reported on Hong Kong’s democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, involving 780,000 people - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the USA is now being transferred to the universities, where Freshmen performances are offered by private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK’s first luxurious travel service for students today.
To make a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private jets, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to drive their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum of luxury.
A company spokesperson said there were no new bookings yet as the service had just been introduced, but added that “students would book the service in the next few weeks.”
The company also said it expects a market for this offer despite the <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year tuition fee.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting this month face a crisis of living costs as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the sharply rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student’s dormitory.
Feminists criticize racial issue and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
Participants raised their hands in the air and sang, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of the unarmed teen Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, as tensions in the Middle West rose and received attention across the country, Perez saw that white women’s responses were 100% about the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, the personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts to Ferguson from a White Woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
“I don’t think you’ll find many people in feminism who are white and talk about privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt urged to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny about myself and my partner on Facebook and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, silence is overwhelming.
“How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship but not about safety in public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the subjects cleanly; they live every day in combined reality.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch Lord.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white women campaigners for women’s suffrage like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for suffrage could only be successful for one group at a time: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to stand up for women’s voting rights, and black voting rights should come later,” Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you realize with power why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize themselves against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to Ferguson’s questions — police behavior, racial discrimination — is a mirror of the time when white feminists played catches with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?” Mitchell asked.
Second-generation feminists who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what that means.
Famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist for the Guardian, calling for more protests from white Americans on the issue of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the race that are significantly different in public surveys - will lead to the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism in which racial as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on the racial issue in America are amazed.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson contradict her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother’s Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is pushing itself into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the southwestern border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform also comes back to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that in order to reconsider the issue as an essential women’s issue, they only need to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in women's organizations," she said.

The details included an image of the living room of the house - including a pig that had laid his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was erroneously published and has now been removed," a company spokeswoman said.
In the house's exposé, Connells described the former congregational building as a "unique one-bedroom single-family home."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The house sale sparked interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
SW city Harvey home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in southwest Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from Saturday’s lottery draw.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the draw of the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
Store owner Steve Forward said the profit is for conversation in the small town in southwest Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a gain could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated wins in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont made the $7.5 million mega win just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said that the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
Harvey’s millionaire is the 59th first division winner in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas bat in the gladiator arena
It was not only the gladiators who stood deep in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and autumn cold and were completely enthralled by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful dance of representations, performances, plays, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial warrior force of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the sand-prepared arena.
The gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men one by one into the ring for a heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
First, the "provocateurs" were in turn with rectangular shield and short sword, as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" with breast shield, short sword and throw flank as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection were followed.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who competed against the "Secutor" with throw net, trident and dagger and, after a short fight, knocked the boy to the ground.
Then the swords collided metallicly, the shields sheaved, and the worms flew through the arena that one could become afraid and frightened for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye on it.
"We wanted to revive the everyday life of the Romans and make the culture of the Roman era experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, president of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park became a "oppidum Romanum" for one day, a Roman city, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of them were also to be admired at Roman Day, for example "aqueduct marble" from the eleven-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Römerkanal bridge, which once stood at Lüffelberg.
The Frontinus Society faced water and energy supply once and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still taking advantage of the knowledge of that time."
This is also confirmed by Ralph Heiliger, a graduate survey engineer from Rheinbach, who presented survey instruments from the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heating system that once warmed the Romanvilla.
Also impressive are the footprints left by wolf and fox in the footsteps of clay two millennia ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office of Soil Monuments at the Rhineland State Association had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building with a dam for drying grain and for malting have been found.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass showcase, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a petite necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
In addition, the children were involved in the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s mill game, or they wrote their names with metal grips on waxboards, like the Roman pupils.
At the stand of the Roman thermals Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, make glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and use a heavy stone wheat mill at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center to grind the flour for a flatbread or a cereal.
With the original Roman carriage, faithfully replicated by two cold flowers, visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented here the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be involved in the Roman Year 2014, proclaimed throughout the Rhineland, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history clubs as well as the Wachtberg Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, the thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and recall the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will be told of his work on the busy Wachtberg, presenting plants as living monuments from the Roman era, and offering a funny teaching lesson in matters of international understanding between a group of Wachtbergers "Germans" and raised Romans.
The Adendorf Elementary School is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often not visible at first glance, are to be re-experienced.
A small presentation in the Wachtberg City Hall will remind you of the find of the Berkumer Matron Shrine in 1879.
Ebola epidemic affects West Africa’s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are moving far away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is causing a severe blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rots on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has severely added to the region.
Some international companies are already distanced.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, it is also an economic one,” said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest hit
“It’s a total catastrophe, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second-largest market in Liberia’s capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, with more than 600 people falling victim to the fever alone.
Recently, health authorities said the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have already died, and thousands more have joined.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies are suspending their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are pulling out their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers also react: only a few traders still leave their hometowns to get supplies.
In some quarantined areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore directly and urgently aware of the consequences of the epidemic: food is scarce.
In the markets, the supply of staple foods such as rice is declining.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, threatens to damage its image - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
It is important to know how far and for how long the virus will spread.
Investors may have the impression that “it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest,” Hugon warned.
The disease also burdens the burdensome state budgets of states
The disease also burdens the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
Rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely strained by high spending on the healthcare system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (45 million euros).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where so far few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of infection.
Reservations at hotels are also declining significantly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50-year founding celebration are underway from 12 to 14 September.
On Friday, September 12, a great evening of entertainment with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned.
On Saturday, at 6 p.m., the big bullet shooting takes place.
Then, in the big party tent, the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam" is held.
Blasskapelle ensures the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big festive at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the prize distribution of the federal and Gaussian shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festive ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker took over the patronage.
The original designation "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the Association for "Social Entertainment by Exercise in Zimmerstutzen and Kleinkaliberschießen" was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again, who on April 30 in the inn Lukas lifted the "new" shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooting champion through a difficult initial period, when it was mainly about finding a club venue and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965 the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records were purged annually and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club hall "Leininger" no longer met the demands of a modern shooting club, the then board under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After 2700 hours of work, on 8 May 1988, Pastor Strasser granted the church blessing for the new shooting rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gauss shooting, combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a Böller Group was established.
Josef Schmalzl became a Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association last year modernized the rooms and the shooting facility at the Berngauer Hof and thus brought them to the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
You can also see the sporting performances of the shooting club.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air gun team, one sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml have climbed from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as Bockstiche, carnival and royal ball, club excursion and Christmas party have a tradition.
With them, the shooters are also at the festivals in parish and community.
Tony Stewart crashes when he returns to race track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart raced against the wall for the second time after his right front tire broke in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
Team boss Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but now focuses on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
“I wish we had a better stake and a better result for him,” Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
“I went in today with pretty good hopes for a good result,” Johnston said, adding: “It just didn’t work out.”
Not long after the second accident, Stewart’s car was loaded into the tractor and the team had packed and were ready to depart.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ash race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart is expected to face an indictment.
The three-time champion was greeted with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start in 12th position, Stewart moved into the top 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs fell
Carts with No. 18 out of control after exiting Turn 2 and collided with Stewart, both driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell to 21st place.
Dance-loving youngsters wanted
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to combatants.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups on TV Jahn also provide full-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now more and more young people are looking for a sport that is healthy and fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly a dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15 years old," said the 20-year-old.
With more active, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can enjoy the training hours on Thursdays between 5 and 6 p.m. or on Fridays between 5 and 6:30 p.m. in the dance hall at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation.
“The training regularly starts with a warm-up program,” the trainer says.
Afterwards, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, sociability is not too short.
"We also go out to eat, watch dance films and we have also stayed in the dance room before," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group, you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your motor development.
If you don’t like jazz dance, you can also enjoy one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and teenagers can always enjoy classes on Wednesdays in the areas of children’s dance/jazz dance, babyni ballet, videoclip dancing and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Mondays and Wednesdays.
Those who want Discofox, Slow Walzer, Viennese Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can visit and participate.
Bulgarian prison guards protest all over the country
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have staged a nationwide protest outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically for a month against the new working hours and demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reported the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR).
The negotiations continue, the Director-General for the implementation of penal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.
The protest of prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Union of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy fighting, allegedly involving Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army abandoned the airport of Luhansk rebel castle on Monday.
The army said seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have again shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents told Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian Coast Guard boats for the first time in the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian border guards confirmed that two of their ships were fired on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported having brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the Ukraine contact group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicly announce their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is complying with the 1997 NATO-Russia Council founding agreement.
However, the NATO leader accused Russia of "a sharp breach" of the agreement.
“Today we have to see reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side indicate that “they regard us as opponents.”
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
A "readiness action plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
Negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision by the European Union, whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Due to the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not been getting any fuel from Russia for weeks.
EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger recently mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine has warned that Russia could also disrupt the gas supply to Europe.
Europe takes about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says tolls will come ‘clear’
Now the Chancellor clearly acknowledges that.
However, it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The persistent concerns of the CDU against the car toll have increasingly angered the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car toll after continued resistance from her CDU.
"To make it very clear: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party chief said on Monday after meetings of the CDU's top committees in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not set out on a detailed model for the time being.
The government’s black-red program calls it “certain parameters.”
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and on it is now being worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also constructively involved in the deliberations for a bill.
In addition, he also discussed with Dobrindt on other ways to enable more private capital to invest in infrastructure, such as broadband expansion.
Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is examining its own concept to remunerate highway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the cabinet.
CDU Federal Vice-President Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to enumerate all district and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU country chairman.
In this regard, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again on the subject.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDU national associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
There are concerns that a toll could affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded loyalty from the CDU because of the toll criticism.
The Left sees the plans as failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which should start in 2016.
Domestic car owners may not be charged additionally under the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the motor vehicle tax.
However, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers because of their nationality under EU law.
Genetic Disorder Often Misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few more years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) — a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are thought to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an insecure gait and curved toes.
The sick also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich ataxia (FA), a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she turned 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same as the others.
I kept falling down and everything lasted longer.
I could never ride roller skateboard or skateboard with the other kids and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she looked at her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
“I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society,” she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and terribly panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25 and slowly lose all my abilities in between.
I did all this with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities hadn’t decreased as much as she had imagined and consulted her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After a few genetic tests, her CMT was detected.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former army training ground
For almost ten years, no gunfire has been fired on the former military training ground in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the Schwäbische Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up locally.
An ear-deafening bang sounds at the blasts over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen military training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6,500-hectare area has been the core of the Schwäbische Alb biosphere area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on businessmen in Washington area rises with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for businesses in the country rose slightly last year as economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local agencies in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local corporate tax burden rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of declining modesty in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from companies.
Virginia has the lowest corporate tax revenue with 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in corporate real estate values, the researchers say, which led to a 3.7 percent increase in real estate taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process also seems to apply to the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 — a 4.2 percent increase over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective at increasing state and local tax revenues, as property taxes amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
“In Maryland, much of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland earned $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
As the trend moves in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three locations.
The increase rate in the district was 4.3 percent the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes in all three offices, at 6% (fixed corporate tax rates in all three).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the District at a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local corporate taxes and a better overall tax climate than Maryland.
The district was not investigated in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to up to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, so they pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen—a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized into—in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in overall tax revenues for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government’s spending cut impacts the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China is now looking for a brewery and is also hoping for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt’s partner city of Guangzhou – this is the urgent wish of officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle down in our city," Li Yiwei, vice party secretary of the South China metropolis, said this week during a visit to a SPD delegation in his city.
The official of the ruling Communist Party of China repeatedly responded to this concern of the 12 million metropolises during the course of the talks.
Guangzhou, which in Germany is also called the Canton, is one of the richest cities in China, Li warned.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, promised the host that he would look for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
“It doesn’t take much for beer: good water, grain and joy of life,” he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
Then the official from Guangzhou hit with shepherd gumbel - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao dates back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Purity Law.

A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Li said.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.
“It would be worthwhile again,” the local politician said.
“Traffic between our two cities continues to grow.”
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour over Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this desire in his talks with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea," Schäfer-Gümbel replied - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Well-kept partnership
The deputy party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he can visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already in the Main, but not yet in this role.
He only took office this year after his predecessor was removed from office on corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The crackdown on officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being harshly enforced by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a senior official in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000-kilometre-distance Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese association was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong with its economic power as the whole of Hesse.
Next year, it wants to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers' family "punches their thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter today showed hope that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're all pushing our thumbs.
According to sources, her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that are coming into trade today, stricter environmental standards will apply in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1st, on which the buyer can recognize at a glance key data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
New cars are subject to higher levels of nitrogen oxide in the Euro 6 pollutant class.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolders: they receive a uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros nationwide.
Amazon Buys Twitch for $1.04 Billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported Monday morning: The online retailer — and video producer, and a host of other things — buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service was decided for a cool billion, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their bravour pieces in games, a “YouTube for live games,” according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better-thinkers give the (mostly older) games a paint of secret science theaters, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was a bit bored, a textbook example of an established tech company buying a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come about as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it right now is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they’d rather play sports than watch, it’s hard to grasp the attraction that comes from watching others play instead of taking the control console into their own hands.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watching a madman get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
All of these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the viewing perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete whole games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there isn’t a game or humour virtuoso in it, his Twitch channel probably isn’t that interesting.
What do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch is accessed by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have just swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men being recruited as advertisers.
As Twitch chairman Shear said, Amazon and Twitch “both believe in the future of gaming,” and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even – swallowing – as a spectator sport.
On the hopping castle at the Burggartenfest there was a lot going on on Sunday evening.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the heavy rainfall on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in Salzwedeler Burggarten should radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes anyway.
This was already evident early on Sunday, when the first visitors made their way to the open air.
A celebration for all generations was promised by the organizers.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply stalls on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, wiped their feet in pace, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were required.
And that across the generations.
While some of them lulled on blankets on the extra white sand at the beach bar, others lulled at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the offspring roared at the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in children's make-up, the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had all the hands full to do in order to master the urge and to enchant imaginative creations in the little faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop organized by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m., he pounded on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop.
“There came more people than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of a “success all along the line.”
Therefore, there is nothing to stop a repeat of the big party in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event still have to be worked on, Sem made it clear in a first report on Sunday to the popular vote.
He said it was annoying that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with insufficient forces.
As a result, some who had already paid did not get to the site.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1,200 visitors who thronged themselves in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band Blocks<0x60>n<0x60>Rox broke off their performance.
The technicians were unable to create a half-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tire failure.
“They will be there next year,” the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will still be forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.
Even on the social network Facebook, the organizers have to put in criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier said on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you've taken over a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others don’t see the initial problems so tightly.
I find it very good that some people not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their legs.
Hat off!" writes Stephanie Jenss to the Amula.
Now the organizers have a year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg’s landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-made component awaits to be inserted into the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the installation of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
The size is still a world record.
The last step in completing the new case is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new envelope is placed.
If the weather plays along, the action is expected to go on stage earlier this week.
Participant in the ice bucket challenge distorts jaw
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much when her icy water was poured over her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge went painfully wrong.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after screaming at the ice bucket challenge so much that she turned her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she violated her facial structure.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did it, my jaw just stopped,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn’t work, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mom and sister saw it too and almost got into their pants with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Britain has been admitted to the hospital to let her jaw restart after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon be pulling back on a string?
Lastly, there was repeated dispute between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereine.
Now the boards are considering possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
Even a year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
Until now, the views on how the history of the Wolfratshaus castle and a possible reconstruction should be dealt with seemed to be very different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks about a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down," Sjöberg said.
In his opinion, all the members of the two clubs could be drawn back to one line in the future.
Thus, there are more visible successes.
While the friends of the castle around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until the last reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest in mind, for the castle club around Sjöberg the "opening and experiencing" of the site is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, Second Chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased with the call, according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in charge of the castle friends.
A new chairman is scheduled to be found at a meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the association currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we put the club's activities to rest out of respect at first," he said.
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current mood picture within their grouping.
There is no candidate for the presidency yet, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find themselves." He himself does not want to run because he is living in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to “but very gladly continue to work on the project”.
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in Piffl’s eyes in the near future.
He recognizes Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to a high participation of the population and by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to move forward with the project, which could create a "differential feature" for the raft city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard," he hopes that the Burgverein may be moving on this point.
Their goal, first of all, to document the story, "is important and good".
After that, you could continue to see.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of college books for many students is more than $1,000 a year, near-second-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan system for books from higher-semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay resale.
“My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a-keks,” said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
College management reported that students spend on average more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there are various cost-cutting options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Leasing textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college bookstores last spring semester, Neebo’s Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-stop shop for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only one-third of the price they have in the campus bookstore online.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be purchased from specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t mind the notes of other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand issue of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.”
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors if previous expenses are permissible.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting
Leasing textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and don’t want to keep the books after the course is over.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent Calculus for about $20 for the duration of a semester.
Find out about the terms of the business you are renting from, including the penalty fees that may be incurred for writing notes, underscores or traces of use.
Pay attention to tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent Calculus for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best deals, as many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look around anyway.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard road.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cashier
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" grossed less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" grossed only $12 million of his $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz-styled film "Sex Tape" earned only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon Taming Easy 2" also disappointed in revenue.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in children's films could be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year ever" for children's films, describing "Dragon Taming Easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, when it comes to films for a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer film release shown between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and this year on at least 2,000 screens.
The results are based on the opinions of cinemagoers and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year’s.
Some commentators say the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s upcoming jungle book film, told Hollywood Reporter: “I think times are changing.”
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
Unlike Hollywood productions’ currently weak cash flow, Netflix recently generated $1.2 billion in revenue from streaming content, nearly twice as much as last year, when revenue was $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics and prophesiing a “core meltdown” of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cashier hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in cash earnings as simply “cyclical” and told Hollywood Reporter, “Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about the business anymore.”
A few years ago, when the 2nd district table tennis class was removed in order to tighten the league classification, that was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the programme.
As a result, those who have not ascended have descended.
Göttingen’s highest-class team, Torpedo, has avoided the descent in the upper league, but will only play fifth-class in the coming season.
Fourth-class torpedoes remain ladies, despite their grandiose march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony league, as do the boys of SC Wende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve compete in the new Bundesliga, in the Landesliga no more Göttinger Clubs are represented.
For the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the association league, the torpedo second in the national league.
What looks like a better district class in terms of composition is now the new Bezirksoberliga Süd.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the district league, Dransfeld and SC Wende play as regional representatives, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are all here.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each
SC Wende sends its girls to the small district league.
Nor is the SCW Boys' district league squad - there still starts Torpedo II - complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Wende and Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the Ost-Staffel.
The Women's Circle League consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women’s teams at the district level.
Surprisingly, none of the six 2nd Kreissclasses will reach target strength, here the innovative and vibrant district board will already have to think about it.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter-top.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments this weekend for us and spoke with demonstrators who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWO juvenile Buschwanderers were brought to safety with the rope wind after being caught overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon at Govett’s Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at around 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search force of local police and rescue services broke out and the couple was found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at around 11 p.m.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and had his head opened.
Rescuers stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flown out Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
The roughly 1,000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The station resumed the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the stick-equipped demonstrators had damaged the editorial equipment.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The protesters are calling for the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said about a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif there were clashes of around 3,000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
According to the hospital, a police officer was injured.
At least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured over the weekend as protesters attempted to enter Sharif’s residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military on Sunday evening, after a meeting at Army headquarters, called for a political solution to the conflict “without wasting time and applying violence.”
The statement said: “The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has sparked concern about military intervention, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been ongoing since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to persevere on Sunday.
“We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign,” Khan said.
Qadri said similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and proclaim new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially persevered peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called them on the weekend to enter Sharif’s residence.
Hutteldorfer finished third in the table after his second season win.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week for Rapid took a reconciling end on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the exit in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The experience of success was terribly important," confirmed captain and goal scorer Steffen Hofmann, who took third place with green and white.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second victory of the season and goes into the national game break with a successful experience.
“We wanted to show a positive reaction,” said outside defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the stage for victory in the 14th minute with his magnificent lead volley from the sixteenth.
"I thought I'd cut all the frustration from Thursday and squeezed it under the bar," the 26-year-old said, smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga party on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship striker in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, because I am from the Rapid youngster," Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic’s short-term pelvic injury, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his job very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position mirrorwise.
He has earned the goal, he has already done some assists this year," Barisic praised.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2:0 by Hofmann after well an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written as well.
"Thank God we were lucky today," said Schrammel, referring to the breakdown of performance and results in the past few weeks: "The results have not voted, but the game has always been good compared to last year."
Barisic even said he had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that has played at this stadium this season".
The first three-pointer since July 26 therefore proved that the team structure was intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team showed that it has character".
He said: “We’ve finally played to zero again.
Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures are to be complained, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting debuts, makes the victory even more valuable.
"We must not forget that," Barisic warned, who lost in the last three days to Behrendt and Pavelic players "who have been very stable lately".
The break of the national matches must therefore be used to "lick wounds and increase a bit in the physical field," said Barisic, who has five U21 players in his ranks.
One of the ones that seems to be particularly interested in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He tears himself for the team, goes through pain over it.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic said.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his changeover in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who made his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "You must not believe that everything is good now" "We have certainly also had a bit of luck, but at some point luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time,” Hofmann said.
He said: “You can’t always see it in black and white.
We haven’t played as badly in the last few weeks as this has been portrayed.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
They are holding on to me at certain stages,” Hofmann said.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team.
He regretted the quick match-match "from the category Magic Gate", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly dismissed by referee Kollegger.
The only complaint I can make to the team is that we weren’t concrete enough towards the goal in some stages.
We had too few grades.
Internal defender Maximilian Karner looked the same: "It started just as badly, but then we found it pure and even made a goal.
In general, there would have been more in it.
Under this climax there is rest
We showed a powerful tribe during our riddle run of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the specimen depicted is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It passes couples, basalt stone piles and basalt stone seas.
A little bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it protrudes beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and, with a circumference of more than eight meters, resembles an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer Archiv and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what kind of skill it has with the squid oak.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Accordingly, until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds are said to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the arduously cleared and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree are said to have rested the animal guards exhausted by the ascent.
Meanwhile, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows, goat herds are actually grazing again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When entering the stone accumulations, however, caution should be exercised, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place to stay for cruciate otters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are signposted, climbing towards Hochrhön and inviting you to an extensive hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle that is searched for in our next task is rather rare to find in the altitude.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district, to which the building counterfei could fit.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner Glück"?
My piece of Rhöner Glück

After weeks of tumult, Italy’s prime minister and current EU chairman Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit last week, has enforced the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, she will succeed British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government-friendly daily La Repubblica reflects, the appointment of his Mogherini, also considered in the government team as a favorite, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes that the left party base, which is constantly rebelling against him, will be calmed, because Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit more moderately.
In comparison with the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as Council President Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome will establish a political balance.
At the same time, the EU’s chief diplomat will be deputy to Commission President Juncker.
The approval of the European Parliament is still pending.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an “important recognition” of Italy’s role in the EU.
La Repubblica is optimistic that Mogherini, known for his ambition in leading party offices for nearly two decades, will show up to the "enormous challenges".
The Roman-born woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 with a doctorate in politics in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic Center Party Margherita in 2008 to form the present Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election of the Left Democrats in 2001, she entered high-level party politics, working in the Department of Foreign Policy, which she soon became head of.
It occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party’s over 40 percent votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The remarks in Brussels that the new EU foreign minister has insufficient diplomatic experience, i.e. lack of substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic Members, Mogherini's distrustful realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being persecuted and defamated as a "Russian-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe bypassing Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin during the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to an economic summit in Milan for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will work in four training occupations: electronics technicians (three apprentices), mechatronics technicians (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All apprentices come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices previously attended primary or middle schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years as well as the instructors travel to a team building event in Oberammergau, where a full-day hike and rafting on the inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees across Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of apprentices spread over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should “keep their mouths shut and get France in order,” said Francois Hollande’s most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show “their love” for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reform has met with disapproval among the vast majority of French.
The president deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It is our duty to stand by his side,” he said with great applause.
As a calming gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for easing the regulation on the part of Emmanuel Macron, the new economic minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow socialists to “unite” with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, poured sand into the gear, in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist MPs, criticizing the Socialist Party for taking the French "belief in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists’ constant trench fights, saying she couldn’t imagine the new Vall’s government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not survived even a summer.
"And the new one won't survive autumn or winter either," Le Pen told supporters.
She repeated her party’s call for a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident to win early elections and was ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was at the forefront of the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Holland’s 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve improvement in the economy and record unemployment numbers.
“There is a small window of possibilities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen further.
Norwegian Cruise is on the verge of a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise provider, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships as well as its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end unsuccessfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to be able to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo declined a comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6% compared to the previous year.
The total cruise industry stands at about $29 billion and is expected in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
Companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers among the cruise operators.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino mixing group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly hold 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A Beijing-faithful group rocked the Chinese flag nearby.
The Permanent Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law on Sunday that only allows two or three candidates for the 2017 Hong Kong leadership election.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with Beijing-faithful members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be admitted to elections, prompting pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and paralyze Hong Kong’s financial center with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper in June, which outlined China’s dominance over Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral procedure in the Special Administrative Region, in which hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li’s interview is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Judicial Committee of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Office of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs of the State Council, Feng Wei, are expected to be interviewed in the course of the day.
Student activists announced they would gather in the afternoon outside the office of the leadership in Hong Kong.
Britain did not see any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to start ‘state talks’ with eastern Ukraine
According to Russian media reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "stateliness" of the apostate region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made clear that Putin did not mean that the territory under the control of the separatists in eastern Ukraine would become a part of Russia, but that its status vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, is in line with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the riots five months ago: aid for the separatists in occupying territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossia region to achieve factual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with state-run TV channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the separatist-held territories in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have lately called the occupied territory "Novorossia" or "Neuro-Sudan", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary splendour of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those in the wake of Ukrainian politicians’ campaigns for the elections on Oct. 26 and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in separatist-held areas are hoping for soon-to-be peace talks “trapped in their illusions,” Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately begin detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to disperse fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman’s clarification of the correction of the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underscored Russia’s claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russian and pre-conflict polls showed a large majority for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats in international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thus de facto giving the Kremlin control over an area that connects Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries, which make important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian legislation should consider additions to the constitution, after new elections, giving the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arming and instigation is accused of Moscow.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to negotiate at eye level with the separatist leaders followed a further intrusion by rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks invaded the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea into eastern Ukraine.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoazovsk, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, as the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a 500,000-inhabiting steel industry port between Novoazovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at an EU leadership meeting in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We are on the verge of a point where there is no turning back,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided no concrete actions, the leadership called for the draft of further sanctions against Russia to come into effect in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank colonists and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council.
The first sixty-three Ukrainian soldiers, allegedly locked up by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk, were exchanged on Sunday for ten Russian paratroopers who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrity and Gabi Grecko nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger over hackers who allegedly stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the Hollywood A-promises.
The film city is in excitement after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal about celebrities on the Internet.
The hacker probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, a star from "The Tribute of Panem" and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were allegedly also released private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Noblest, who had engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and images should be kept private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly said a news website that the hack was “shameful” and that those affected felt “wounded.”
The hacker presumably has 30 images of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies upstairs without in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative for Lawrence told TMZ: “It’s an abhorrent violation of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing but selling hellerware."
Purely legally, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers participated yesterday in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg and thus supported the association "Hilfe für Krebskranke Kinder".
The tour, which was a torture for one, was an easy training for the others.
But in one thing, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the boss of the Oberurseler Brauhaus went on a bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
The small muscle soreness can easily be put away there, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg in favor of the association "Aid for Cancer-Sick Children" (Frankfurt) had also brought him personally a valuable knowledge.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - great!"
Small punch on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants tormented themselves yesterday in early dew to the mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happily arrived on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the roughly 11-kilometre-long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - did something else on understatement at the start ("Every crowd of professionals, there's the finish!"), but then proved to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without shortness of breath.
He also crossed the route in a slip, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman of the city of Oberursel, who had set out together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg bikes" were not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be there - we would have made an exit anyway today," Kuhn said.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had descended to Oberursel in the morning to step back up immediately afterwards.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung in the saddle at 9am in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, then rolling home with fun.
There was also a lot of fun with "Fried-Toni".
For the head of the Oberursel cult kiosk, cycling over the Feldberg is simply one of them.
He had been aiming for 40 minutes on his 6.5 kilo race bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
That must be he too, because he was traveling with the "fixie-wheel", these are also road bikes, but without a gearbox...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the fox dance to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord, proved that it was easy to go up without a wheel.
Bergwacht-Doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with all-wheel-bully and quad, ensured safety, said: "I know him" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sleigh trail, only that he pulls the sleigh himself."
The 718 participants - and thus more than ever before - had been sent to the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Biking on the Greater Feldberg", gave the starting commandos and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
