AM in Wales is worried about "promoting as puckon"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused by a proposal to change their title to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal will, after plans to change the name of the National Assembly of Wales Parliament.
AM across the political spectrum is worried about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who cannot Walisian: Twp means stupid in Walisian and pwp means bajs.
An AM for Plaid said the group was generally "unhappy" and has suggested other options.
A conservative waliser said his group is "open" for the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh just like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which currently compiles legislation for the name change, said: "The final decision for what members of the congregation should be called is of course up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the outcome of a public consultation on the proposals, which found a strong support for calling the Assembly for Wales Parliament.
Regarding the title of AM, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members (members of the Wales Parliament) or WMP, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AM apparently proposes other options, but problems with reaching a consensus may cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The amendment legislation also includes other amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including the rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonia is making a referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the neighbouring country's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the change of name and has said he will ignore the result.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's silence when the churches of Harlem encounter problems
"Older people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
“Now there is neither.”
He said it is understandable that the bars disappear.
“People hang out in other ways nowadays,” he said.
“Children are not like the area’s living room anymore, where people go on a regular basis.”
Regarding the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as the leaders expect and that "before or later they will end up on the route one again."
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with ownership apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments probably will not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Reverend Johnson's congregation planned the renovation, they also built the clock game.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the watches of the poor".
The expert who played the bell game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historic instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician - Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the major bell game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
The events of the past few months at St. Martin's are a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs - some hired by the church's laymanship, others by the Episcopal Foundation.
The Church’s governing body consisting of laymen wrote to the foundation in July and expressed an concern that the foundation would “try to transfer the cost” to the church meeting, although the church meeting had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some church members complained of a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Shark injures 13-year-old who dives after lobster in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who appeared after a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had appeared with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shout for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him up of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the entire key legs had been worn up.
"I cried to everyone to get out of the water. 'It's a shark in the water!'" Hammel told me.
The boy flew to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his state is stated to be critical.
It is unclear what a shark it was.
Swimming guard captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered trauma injuries on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's enters the UK Beauty Market
Sainsbury's takes care of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with grocery-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK’s beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty features will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket’s attempts to fill the shelves that were previously taken up by TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they intend to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with selected areas, such as in shops like Boots.
The shop chain also re-launches its boutique makeup brand so that most of the products are vegan - as more and more young customers require.
In addition, perfume salesman Fragrance Shop will test stands in two Sainsbury's stores - the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look increasingly like department stores in an attempt to fight cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stand in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased the sales of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facial lift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute over how the revenue from Boots sales in the supermarket would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the chain Lloyd's Pharmacy, £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial manager, said: “We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an appealing environment in smooth places, we are now a attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way to shop.”
Peter Jones "rasing" after Holly Willoughby pulls out of deal of £11 million
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones is "rasing" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby is not enough with their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den-star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute - to focus on their new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became "rasing" at an exciting meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new deal — worth up to £1.5 million — meant she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced her leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her vacation homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to pull out shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at the headquarters of Marlow."
Experts believe that this Morning presenter’s decision to withdraw can cost the company several million due to significant investments in everything from pillows and lights to clothing as well as the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role of Chairman in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
It was a great snack, "and we fell in love."
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider “invaluable to a president” and because he was so positive about North Korea’s leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "news anchor voice":
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been underway.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diploma Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "corresponding response" from the United States after North Korea's first disarmament step.
He noted that instead, the United States continues sanctions intended to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.”
He said his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim have had positive results — an end to rocket tests, liberated hostages, and returned the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, we’d have around 200 people here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake destroys Indonesia island, hundreds die
After the earthquake on Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboks's population had lost their homes, it was not declared a state of emergency, as required for international assistance.
“In many cases, they have unfortunately been very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which complicates it all,” Ms Sumbung said.
Save the children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear if foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman of the natural disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Given Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country is still incredibly unprepared for the anger of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters further complicated logistics.
A hospital vessel that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises of improving Indonesia’s worn infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums of money on roads and railroads.
But lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's elections.
Mr. Joko is also pushed by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, archers and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge resigned at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri around 30 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team was behind with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick at the far post.
The attempt flew high across the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's hope and ended up in the net.
"I just tried to get into a position to access the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and didn't think so much about it but just kicked."
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker lifted a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spinning off near the centerfield and sprinting to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the middle field.
Then he got a superb kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far post with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea faces VIdeoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been stuck in the spills of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 earthquake which struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of hurricanes from buildings that collapsed.
Police arrested 32 suspected of murder after a woman was murdered
A murder investigation was started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with knife wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to appear.
Criminal Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspected to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived to the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's closest relative.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can get into or get out of the building.
He became rude when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it takes several hours before they can enter again.
A police assistant told a man that the whole area was treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
She says "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another just outside.
A number of police assistants stood within the shutdown with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victims of dispute rewriting history
A banning would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal for "badness" and "try to write about history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Wrong Cromwell might be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the 19th-century view of and is part of the historiography of a man many consider still to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, consider Cromwell defending Parliament from pressure from outside, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a correct representation, it is subject to an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the mid-17th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person representing one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Murder pig kills farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a path in the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig steak on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a swine trail nearby was open.
He said there was a big pigtail in the swine stairs with blood on his mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that the 250 kilograms heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and distorted," said the cousin identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market managers are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It is rare that pigs attack people, but it has happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, giving the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kilograms stuck a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can serve as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa for widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, the hurricane Rosa becomes weaker when it travels over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at 5 o'clock on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a bush begins to form across the Pacific Ocean and travels eastwards towards the U.S. western coast. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical humidity north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching tree will create widespread heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Local rain will cause dangerous flooding, mud flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to 5-7.5 cm of rain per hour in some locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is definitely not recommended that anyone leaves the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can make canyons wandering rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching tree brings some locally heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and slippery roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainfalls will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain will be wider later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to get a warm start on October with around 30 degrees from the Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be around five degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearings
Over 20 million people watched Thursday's arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults that were supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political mortality continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday's last minute twist - Arizona's Senator Jeff Flake's deal with the FBI where they got a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh tainted her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks showing the interrogation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking from offices.
Comparatively, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the final game or Oscars gala.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day long interrogation, according to Nielsen.
The ABC had nearly 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the interrogation.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters screaming at him trying to take an elevator to a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the protesters shouted at him, as was shown in live broadcast by CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?”
They also said, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The television networks broadcast live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on if they would bring further Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do so if the FBI was going to investigate the charges against the nominee in the coming week, which the minority Democrats have called for.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several Senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "political plays" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for “political plays” about Britain’s future and to undermine the nation’s interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's customs duties was "completely unreasonable".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect for the deaths of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for murder, police said in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the battle.
Police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After interrogating with Simpson, the police said he confessed that he shot Wayde.
His castle was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thanked the Louisiana State Police's fugitive agency, the police's state lab, Southern University's police and residents in the area for help with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU’s athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their “flite and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crossed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," Wade said.
Volcano rushes ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was discovered in the crater and the recorded 183 gas and ash emissions over the course of 24 hours.
The centre discovered several mulls and swarms.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted increased activity in the volcano standing 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 affected central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police strike together with Catalan separatists for the anniversary of the Independence Vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters struck with demandall police while taking part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by demandall police threw eggs and color powders on them, leading to dark ponds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battles also broke out later in the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups shouted "never forget, never forgive" while the unionists shouted "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local pressure.
The atmosphere is still tense in the region that longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October considered illegal by Madrid but was praised by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but participation was low when most who opposed the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped on the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
Electrician Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer believes that Catalonia will be independent.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to vote, but now we've been stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties that are for independence have had difficulty keeping the drive up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-detained exile or sit in detention waiting for trial on their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his mobile, said the conflict had been fired on by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more excited," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he intends to candidate in the election to the European Parliament next year.
“Candidate to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the undercover we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car driving into house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was driven into a Londonderry house repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
An armbrush may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 to Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not won a away win in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning stretch to six matches - head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against cross-visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored goals; their fairness gave Rangers all possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after sliding in to measure Craig Halkett's nickel across the goal.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, as they knew they could attack in definite games.
That’s how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, which scored goals from the middle of the goal area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was impermeable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was left largely in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot board from another of Livingston's definite games.
Crossings were constantly entering Livingston’s target area and were handled without any problems. Two criminal claims - after Halkett’s challenge by exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand - were dismissed.
"Peomenal" from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed the expectations of the road upwards.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves the honour of having galvanized the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the heavily straight through.
Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have had their moments under Gerrard, but they did not live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn't hold the goal - they just opened the homepage once - and it's one of an alarm clock for the Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered smiles and blue sky (29 September) when Turkey’s and Germany’s leaders ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany — to repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become unhappy about human rights, freedom of pressure and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters — many of them Kurdish — also heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dueling protests show the split opinions of a visitor who is considered a hero of some German Turks and is condemned as a single-violent ruler of others.
Road Accident in Deptford: Bicyclist dies in crash by car
A cyclist has died in a crash with a car in London.
The crash took place near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-traffic road in Deptford in southeast London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and health care professionals were called there, but the man died on the spot.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infestation accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they are trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been redirected and car drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in unrest on a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The concerns broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and still going on.
Specialized "tornadovacts" have been called there to deal with the unrests, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated in place for minor injuries to the face.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident on HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those responsible for this will be attributed to the police and may be given extended imprisonment.”
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June it was reported that the prison director was treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, demandall police were called to prison to deal with serious unrest where staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (area of drought can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressures reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy thrusts across the desert in the southwestern United States, at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, bringing rain late on Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of Arizona's border.
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 2.5-5 cm of rain at risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas with no risk of sudden flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be useful because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffer from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane power on Sunday morning with a maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific Ocean, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico's land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5-15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, at a risk of up to 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north over Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The biggest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in the desert, as well as landslides in rocky terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenager boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for murder attempts after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and the situation is reported to be "stabil".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the area of Radstock, police said in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who can have filmed what happened to the cell phone to appear.
Trump says Kavanaugh "led, evil, anger" from the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthlessness and scandalous tactics," Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from “the evil, anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually abused her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress on his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his supporters in the audience in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
“We are five weeks from one of our most important choices.
“I don’t candid, but I candid,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going around and fighting for supreme candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to “resist and prevent”.
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of rising
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed towards the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed towards the beach in the skyscraper and swept out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stayed on the beach instead of immediately running away, and they fell victims of the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesian disaster agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone but dragged cars, stocks and houses with it. It hit everything in its way," said Nugroho. He also said that the tsunami had travelled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed up in trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The line of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's agency for the evaluation and application of technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times as large as the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "inclusive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
Killed victims were found during the crash of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and injuries could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," said Nugroho.
"There are over 300,000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said the waves had emerged within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man is heard on the top of a building screaming frenetic warnings about the tsunami of people on the street below.
Within a few minutes a wall of water crashes towards the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to an extensive power outage that interrupted all communication around Palu, which made the rescue work difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun sending there cargo flights with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city’s airport has been opened for the assistance work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit Palu facilities on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from the World Vision in Donggala have come to Palu where they seek shelter under the shelters of the farm outside the office, but they saw devastation along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Assistance groups have started the biased assistance work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and employees from abroad may only be used if a state of emergency is declared after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the authorities say it’s a national disaster, we can release international assistance, but that status has not been announced yet.”
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing people were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that illuminate dark natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been stuck under a hurry for two days with her mother’s body next to him.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia's national screen flight coach, had trained two of the missing screen pilots for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a screen flight veteran, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told me the hours after the screen pilots heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages only got a grey hedgehog, instead of two blue.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves charge $26,750 under bankomat filling at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled a bankomat at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The driver of the car had emptied a bankomat in the entertainment facility and was going to deliver more money, said detective Dennis McCarthy.
While he was busy, "another man jumped up behind the Brink's co-worker" and stole a bag of money that would be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee from the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the perpetrator's identity should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rappare Changes Name to Ye
Kanye West is renamed Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter on Saturday, saying, "The creature formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, which set for "emotional reasons" according to the program's creators.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance to him.
"I think 'ye' is the word used most in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, we are.
It went from Kanye, meaning 'the only one', to just Ye - a mirror of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without strings and uppercases.
Mexican AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to never use the military against civilians now as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era when leftist student movements clashed in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States Should Double AI Financing
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, although the U.S. does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China announced its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A double-sized budget could double the chance of the next major AI breakthrough being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies - Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that defeated the highest ranked American Othello player, and later served as the head of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said new immigration policies can also help the United States with AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI," he said.
The State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants grants to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
The Macedonian People's Vote on Renaming
The Macedonian population voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would solve a decade-old dispute with Greece that has prevented the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of its neighbor in the north constitutes a requirement for its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts as to whether the minimum participation of 50 percent required for the referendum to be considered valid will be reached.
The question of the electoral bill in the referendum is as follows: "Are you for membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, its supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth changing their name if it makes Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was split, able to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for the youth of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, for it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the result in order to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
According to the state electoral commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last 2016 parliamentary election when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the Macedonian referendum on the country's change of name, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, arranged a small scene and place out chairs in front of the tents that have been set up by those who boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with the head in the air, not sneak in through the back door,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, a membership of NATO would lead to the necessary investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the absolute majority will vote yes because over 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said that a "Yes" result would be a "confirm to our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Investigation, between 30 and 43 percent of voters voted in the referendum, which falls under the minimum participation required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of participants were going to vote on Sunday.
70% of them voted yes.
For the referendum to be counted, 50% of registered voters plus one vote must be counted.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious backlash for the Western-oriented government policy since it took over in May last year.
Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero takes its way through Brighton’s defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around a defender and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's goal area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the goal area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” City’s manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he made goals at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's revire on that game.
He sent off a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far post.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment before it ended up out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
However, Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, which lies a match before the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still have a chance for the final game.
Rockies got a wild card spot with a win of 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but is still looking for their first division title.
“We’re playing about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in knowing the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at a higher level than any other team I’d face this year.
“Why wouldn’t I want to be there?”
Nationals have not announced their start for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they lean towards allowing Scherzer to throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34rd start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of our most important choices.
This is one of the big, big ... I don't candid, but I candid. That's why I'm going around fighting for supreme candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see a terrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you see that happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their misery, horror.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We're not going to let them get it."
Democrats, he said, struggle to "stand against and prevent."
“You’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “arrow and evil and horrible and false.”
He mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was faced by high bows from the spectators.
"Do you remember what she said?
“Have you finished the document?”
'Eh, eh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm waiting a...' It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They do not tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs to hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly when she resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the nation’s security, on Europe — ironically similar topics to which Jeremy criticized former leaders.
On Friday, the Nottingham East Labour meeting stated that "we want meetings to be welcoming and productive."
For most of my eight years as Labour’s local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But unfortunately, many meetings are not so, and the promise of “friendly, gentle” policies has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly obvious that divergent opinions are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged based on whether the party leaders accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues who I thought had a similar political view that I expected I would make a whole turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed on - whether it was the national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it really doesn't matter what I say - follows a tire of ovets on social media that demands that I be deposed, criticize mid-policy and say that I shouldn't even be part of Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments targeted at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with the politics of this era is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church, and with every mistrust and change of selection rules, the party becomes increasingly narrower.
I have received many advice over the past two years on flying under the radar and not being too straightforward, so it “orderes.”
But that’s not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher’s government’s negligence that literally caused my primary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most — both at the local level and as government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, and that includes the latest election.
No one in Nottingham East may have been confused in any way about my views on policies and topics where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those of you who promoted the claim on Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour’s party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency - both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats to dismiss me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Oslagna Ayr on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested during our matches so far and are still unbeatable, so we’re of course happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland's Captain Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to let the numbers talk and Jason Baggot made an unconverted try.
Climo extended Ayr’s leadership with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the management to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried by the plan, and after the reboot, Ayr increased the leadership again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting Captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-line out behind Ayr's maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent off flank Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.

The bases of the fleet from Lake Titicacas to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it.”
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still strong - and it is also the desire to again sail in the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is higher than for decades now when Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on the first October, after five years of consideration.
“Bolivia has the operation, a mood of unity and peace, and obviously awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the international court’s decision on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Court of the Hague will judge in favour of Bolivia’s demands that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them their own outlet to the sea.
The decision of Monday also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe it is unbelievable that the court judges Bolivia's advantage, and that not much would change even if it does.
The UN court, based in the Netherlands, has no right to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She claims that Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has taken hold of Chile’s remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider that the court's decision had been made unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to start a new era for the relationship with Chile" and a chance to "set a stop for 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the issue of the sea as a political crunch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,” he said.
“The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament demands confidence in the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the nation will not destroy its nuclear weapons only if they can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be on the border to resolve the deaths of nuclear diplomaty more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “desirable dream” to continue sanctions and the U.S. protests against a statement that the end of the Korean War will ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first launching significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against Pyongyang's real intention to get rid of a weapon arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion views reveal latest line huge headbonds on their way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of crazy, oversized headsets for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blended the style icons on the Paris fashion week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent away their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's primary creation was an excessive beige hat with a feather-like wide hat bracelet that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-dried watermelons, a wizard hat and even ananas — but they are not meant to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, for some time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had merged lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a wet suit with a snorkel and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass trunk.
And if you continue the huge fashion, you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge huts can be on their way to shops near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba - the straw hat with a 60 cm steak that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that was behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk - a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The terracotta raffia bag, featuring raffiafranses and a white leather handle, excelled in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the stores next summer - the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills crucial to global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other community engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement customized curriculums, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and demanded topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we can not only rely on English when creating relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received A in the final exam Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students studying Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subject choices are now considered as important as natural knowledge, engineering, engineering and mathematics at curriculums in independent schools and beyond.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that employers for various reasons had difficulty filling their vacancies, with 17 percent attributed to a lack of skills in language.
That said, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries, automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adults published by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent said they could not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that totaled a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
Therefore, it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find a meaningful job in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future has at lut.
In a global economic environment, there is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the country's future, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James make their debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been decided.
“It’ll be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Laker’s official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers’ pre-season schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for a confirmatory vote of his candidate for the Supreme Court's vacant post, Trump aims to build support for upcoming mid-year elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress before the upcoming elections in November.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's interrogation by the candidate to the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited for accusations of his sexual assault, with an expected delay of the vote from the Senate of up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November election.
Thus, President Trump said these five conventions next week are aimed at "engaging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
“Controlling Congress is as important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign period,” a spokesman for the Trump campaign said.
The night's event, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been looking after in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come there to try to give him an increase in opinion surveys,” Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University state scientist, said.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep hopes alive before Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon competitions could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The momentary pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before before competitions like these.
So what momentum is this all about now?
"They had a six-point lead and now there are four, so we carry it as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead of twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel like they have a little wind in the sails, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and precedes with a good example.
The winning squad shook even higher when his round continued and he dropped a decisive putt to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had left behind with two after two games.
His putt that won them the game of 15 was met with a similar trick, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
That’s all these players have now.
18 holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's undeniable story.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and audience reactions state that they are the players to hit on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could comb a potential European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine dropped the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole that they never even came close to climbing out of.
On Sunday, however, no one helps you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are so fascinating to look close because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and took a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a fighting joy that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's final day after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and came home all four points at the Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who struggled to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago dominated an American team that never really got started during tomorrow's four-ball with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomen and won two games, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are just the second couple to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they hit a exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more repressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who got through two games on Saturday, showed a sample of single moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome, and of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's fireball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes for a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked 1st and 3rd in the world.
Europe had no wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Threefold winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, a team has come back from a four-point underpoint in the singles matches, however, Furyk's side only needs a draw result to keep the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says they “never” will disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions deepened their distrust to the United States and it was not possible that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “meaning measures to show its goodwill,” for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the installations for nuclear tests and promising not to spread nuclear and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to an approach divided into stages of nuclear power that would lead to North Korea's reward as it took progressive steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution entirely as Pyongyang previously did.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work against "decommissioning nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump vowed guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has searched for a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first settle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also declined negotiations to relieve harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "decommissioning first" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose through coercion and even object to the "declaration of ending the war," Ri says.
“The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a desirable dream for those people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leaders highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party in this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the Korean peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a dead position."
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the U.S. mainland with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take measures for disarmament, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months," doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: “The maintenance of the security council’s sanctions must continue with force and without failing until we realize a complete, final, verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to stifle the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri during the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of setting "gangster-like claims".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and even a nuclear crash complex if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moving towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has prompted all doctoral students to improve their sleeping habits in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-filled "divings".
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often awkward when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deficiency on learning.
“At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why don’t I know this until now, during my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from serious sleep deficiency during the week.
The hourly course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In some of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change students’ behavior directly.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," Czeisler added.
“The culture of pride in “dyeing” still exists,” he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deficiency was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in starvation mode and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before starting their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider putting an alarm for when to sleep and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn on the day, leading to insomnia problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas target lowers Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take home its first victory on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and Rangers never managed to even out the result.
As Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And there may be more problems at lut for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with the way his well-sold games surpassed the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass released through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A free kick at the depths of Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear post.
Rangers took control of the match, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their game during the last third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt that he should have had penalties when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson whipped away the Colombian call.
The Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibalys nick and a tam kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Life's opening shot in the 34th minute may have gone against the game's spirit, but no one can deny that their kneeling deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher matched Scott Robinson, who stayed calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the outer struck the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the try.
But Livingston continued to make the opponents play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett swept up long pass after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened his leadership in the final stage, but McGregor was well able to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow nicked outside after the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim when he was tamped with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's calendar: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manic called Geiger meter.
Geigermeters have become a foundation of science since then and also characterize great in pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
“What the hell is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that carries his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected.
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well
Kanye West was bowed out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swamping appearance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he himself would be eligible for the post of 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great cap, he rallied against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate’s Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the playback of West's posting was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to do West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he had been harassed backstage for his headbond.
“They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I dropped low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Would you also drop low?" and said that he would "set my supermancape on, because that means you can't say what I can do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments attracted more burops at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person said, "It was deadly in the studio."
West had come in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West surprised many with his appearance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU STAVE ON YOU MOT THE MOBB."
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply “be yourself and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by purchasing his music or clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the being previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Trial of Murder Attempts After Knife Cutting at Restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The allegations will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington beats toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they need to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also her 31, acknowledged that he feels "good" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is born and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel they need to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
“It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not make any Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer and says he is "ready with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so in this way it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 800,000 people have been affected in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to nearly zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through sexual intercourse is an acute issue in China's HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the infectious cases are due to insufficient protection in sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked the GOP Senator's tasks, blaming "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, US Congressman Maxine Waters condemned allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these allegations were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Looks, lies, and more faulty lies," Waters said in a tweet.
The released information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of Water's staff, Hill reported.
“This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Water's statement quickly received criticism online, including from White House's former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they can’t be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motive of the questioner.
They must be calm and sensed.”
Fleischer seemed to be trying to compare Water's reaction with the criticism of Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of appearing angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who candided to depose Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities for these fraudulent claims.
“We will make sure the offenders will be revealed,” she continued, “and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees.”
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit benefits in every new film with British slopes, and the same seems to apply to this remake of the latest Johnny English action comedy - a series of spy parodies kicked in 2003 with Johnny English and renewed life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it true how bad we are to become the nation’s new export product?
In any case, it has the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face been licensed to renew for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide comic creation designed for biopublics even in non-English-speaking countries
He is of course the crazy secret agent, who despite his bizarre claims to smoothieglamour has received a little bit of Clouseau, a nut Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There is one or two great moments in the latest JE movie.
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades briefly struck his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy appears, but humor feels quite low-melt and strangely superfluous, especially because the “serious” film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels as if it’s adapted for children instead of adults and for me, Johnny English’s strange appearance is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film bravader in the role of Bean.
The current topic is now that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the UK's super-secret network of spys, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents out in the field, to the agent in service's great dissatisfaction - an incredibly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw of a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-employed figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does his very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence adviser informs her that when each active spy is busy, she must use someone who retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in any wealthy institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hockey-stick role where Vicki Pepperdine is close to wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer fracture: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of disguised appearances: dressed as waiters, they set fire on a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when smuggling on board Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Quite moderately everything.
And like the other Johnny English films, I can’t stop thinking: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies the preparation of a plan for the British to work a four-day week but receive a salary for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party considers a radical plan that involves the British working for a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to transfer savings made through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra free day.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but retain the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would "pass" with the party's economic agenda in favor of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A representative higher up in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen in one day, but a four-day work week is a quest that fits into the party’s attitude to balancing the economy in favor of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, including the Greens party that promised a four-day work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this goal is not signed by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said, “A four-day week of work is not the party’s policy and it’s nothing that the party agrees on.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless leaders" and "smashers" on state firms.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get back all their efforts, because a Labour government can make “deductions” because of what they perceive has been wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to put workers in business boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10 percent of the private company’s own capital is left over to its employees, who then stand to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy in TV show "60 minutes" tell us whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinions
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could cause some Republican senators to change their position on the issue.
In an interview that aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal about something that would lead them to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice seems unreasonable.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite tanking," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she named could not verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a tremendously impressive set of stars that perform and an equally impressive mission; to fight world poverty.
Now during its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people vaulting to Central Park's Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival is, according to a 2012 statement, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international predecessor group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you weren’t ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling, or in other meaningful ways helping to increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen states that more than 19 million “actions” have been registered from its supporters who struggled for a variety of goals.
It says that these measures have contributed to encouraging world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors committed to "helping children develop into their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as malnutrition is a footnote in history," the ambassador of the Tracey Ullman partnership told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken requiring the UK to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programs targeting 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on its website: "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year’s New York events, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports
The government may "if needed" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy actors from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by Washington Examinator.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it appears on the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability to, with our fleet, make sure that the seaways are kept open and, if necessary, apply blockade, to make sure their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are really the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day ship" with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes after the Trump administration's goal is to increase the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "capture of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington’s opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the notion that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position received a backlash from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly dislike a third party disrupting our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "presumably thinkful" if she is going to run for the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinarily thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the U.S. middle-year elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for a candidate.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman on top," she said.
"After 6 November, I will take a lot of thinking about candidating to the presidential post."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the Town Hall meeting, saying he "took this country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been free-standing in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not think she would be eligible for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "trustful" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not be candidate, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidacy and 48 percent opposed.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump Rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and accused of violence at home on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through now when he’s back, I can relate to other families who have experience with PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back as other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military, have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, attempting to prevent a report on domestic violence and weapons holdings in drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, as well as the District of Columbia support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial trial aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the case of Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The states' lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, such as nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy changed a 2014 decision by the immigration authorities allowing illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed based on specific facts and circumstances as the claim applies, and such a provision is contrary to that principle,” according to the friend-of-the court report.
Advocates further argued in the report that policies denying entry of immigrants harm the American economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "deliver the necessary labour."
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asyl was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day across the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked darker.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his phebriga boy in an evacuation center in the town of Palu.
"The ambulance catches dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a shortage.”
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rooting through water damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals in the earthquake of 7.5 were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershocks.
With tearful eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t escape.
I was pushed into the wall’s ruins, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accused China of "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided advertisement in an American newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to disseminate propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday that China Daily paid a grant in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of attempting to participate in the U.S. 6th Congressional Election, something China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in US elections marked what US officials told Reuters where is a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington's intention to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with elevated tariffs on each other’s imports.
China's retribution tariffs early in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump's Republican Party, this according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “Now doubles the bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
"China's government uses America's dear tradition of freedom of speech and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of divergent votes and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s worried economy, because the media are controlled by the iron hand of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers abolished the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters in the mid-year election through Kavanaugh fiaskot, warns analysts
Since many top Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who faces several accusations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming election.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
You can’t turn the clock back,” Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday.
On Friday morning, demonstrating "November comes!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans who control the court committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go on the roof," Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it was already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among yet indefinite female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Already before Ford's public testimony with allegations of sexual assault against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if the Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is going through, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," said Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group helping democratic election campaigns, to the news channel.
But the Americans generally seem to be divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford has made, as well as those from at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate court committee during ed last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court exposed her genitals while they attended a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people get access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access the type of information.
The company calls it “personal authorization through data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is that the company will bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer encoders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don’t talk to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are set at the top overnight.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a post on the Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era on the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded with the Victoria Cross during World War I
The only priest in the Church of England who was awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his action during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the British military's most prestigious award.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandson, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Water led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine rifles."
He later rushed up to the shooting line and led with "great bravery" the line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble to."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also put down a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "recognized himself very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead saw Greta Gris
Imagine this, you’ve stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live on the night in the UK on channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were impressed after they had stayed awake until the early morning hours to watch the match.
One fan on Twitter described the program change to a children's cartoon program as "a sick joke."
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communication when asked about the broadcast.
"Greet pig, yes"
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their scheduling to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution in terms of the replay," Coker said.
"But there is sex in the morning on a Sunday there and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the change of programs upset many.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was actually a state matter.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over the head in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It's a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” due to sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to his comrades during his upbringing because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize he wasn’t like everyone else until he went to high school.”
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hop".
He also said he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular program manager, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of illness.
During his one-time performance on Laverne's first program, Daley tells him how he felt "less worth" than others during his upbringing, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, “This feeling of feeling less worthy and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so that he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate for HBT rights and exploited its prominence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live open without limitations and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-fold world champion said that his infamous love for a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "come as a surprise."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all life perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year it was just about winning gold,” he said.
“But you know, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they got their tickets to the London Olympic Games in 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't say to him: you won't be able to sit on the front row daddy," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a home audience in an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and still gave him rhythms.

Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid a unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was bent by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting hejaklack and practicing on his game in the hopes of having a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the top of his career, and the 48-year-old is not in shape before the tough course at Le Golf National, where the long rubble often punishes misses hard.
It is not only the banana that deters, in the ninth game on Sunday Mickelson meets the champion Francesco Molinari, who together with the novel Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below the 12 singles matches, have co-wind at first, the Mickelson match may be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on my back, put my arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“His confidence is nothing wrong.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams during previous seasons and over the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd do more, but now it's what it's and we'll be happy with it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson passed Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never completely lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, quick, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just a game.”
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big lead could soon be a memorial.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballestero's leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but ultimately won with the slightest possible margin with the result 141-131-2.
"One reminds you that we led big at Valderrama, we led big at Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with distress and nose," said Bjorn (on the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we will give everything.
Going out and doing everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this cup and that’s where our focus lies.
I’ve said it all the time, I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of what’s waiting on the other side — the best players in the world.”
Björn was pleased with his players’ performances on a tough golf course, adding, "I would never do this myself.
Tomorrow we will face new challenges.
Tomorrow, it’s the individual achievements that apply, and that’s a completely different thing.
It’s fun to be out with a partner when it’s okay, but when you’re out there on your own, your capacity as a golfer is fully tested.
It’s the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also go and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major reverses in the last few days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe ran "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you’d like to go out as fast as on Brookline, as on Medinah.
When the pace starts one way, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediate matches.
We made our setup and placed the guys that we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked to try to lead the game and meet Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it is enough all the way," Bjorn said about his single choices.
Germany's new warship is resumed
The newest fregat of the German fleet would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the escort of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were devastating for the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen frigates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and sea target missiles, as well as some sneaking techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are put into operation,” Die Zeit wrote.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss yards in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media indicated a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
Lacks in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older fregatter in the Bremen class.
It also emerged that the ship has a significant overweight, leading to impaired performance and limiting the naval ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project's price tag - including the training of the crew - becomes a problem.
It is said to have amounted to fraudulent EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the start stage.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important in light of the latest warnings that Germany's naval power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "gets shortages fully equipped ships".
The official said it was a growing problem, as old ships were dissolved but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to join the navy.
National Trust steals the secret life of the bat
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunting for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the South and dwarf pie drivers as well as brown borrowed and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area view of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS natural care advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest fields for bats and other related species.
Fladdermus populations in Scotland and the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects livelihoods and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks from huts.
Fladdermöss are not actually blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the switch.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, examine bon and sometimes carry out rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserves at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threave we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a host of favorable habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He emphasizes the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single dwell could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Fladder mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or destroy their bon.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects rape sentence while his lawyers threaten to prosecute the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him “fake news” and says people “will market themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) dismissed the reports as “fake news” when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the claims were reported.
"No no no no no.
What they said today was fake news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and everything good,” said the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over allegations, which they have called "an unauthorized reporting of suspicions of integrity," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount equivalent to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" the betrayal of the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a conciliation because she felt "fear of retribution" and was worried about "being humiliated publicly."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to revoke the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: Britain "will forever regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if you lost your status as a world leader in automobile production after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, they will temporarily cease production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event that no agreement could be concluded could result in lost jobs.
Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see the production stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini facility in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main issues are what car manufacturers say are the risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it can lead to interference at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and lacks of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day in stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and hence production would be forced to stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid checks at the border".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that enables, as I say, not only success to be appreciated at the moment, but for us to take this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4:s program Today.
"The causes of not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the facility’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite Fack Association at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that these jobs will never return.
A government official said: “We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "shooted in another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in the election, relations between Trump and Russia and the president's potential barriers to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the Deputy Minister of Justice, and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's slabs for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing interception equipment to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th addition of the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, and reports that he would resign appeared.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York City, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee hearings where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been established, it may happen this week, or a delay by a week given all the other things that happen at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some reporters would dispute that claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any dislike to TV reporters who "play for the gallery," even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds more quiz sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without quoting evidence: “We’ve looked at these figures.”
Conferences will still take place,” Sanders said, “if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president might show why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the gathered reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of decommissioned status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralized public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, ahead of decisions expected to come this fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to repeat how much I value each employee’s efforts, regardless of nationality.
Collaborations from across the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering from head injuries
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in Saturday's loss by 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennesseans reported Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injuries occurred just before half time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before being placed on a stretcher was brought out for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center hospital.
Harris added that "there are no data on the type/scope of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the match, giving him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers are allowed to pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless, according to the Tory Party’s new plans
The action will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The British Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be allowed to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The action will be perceived as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of housing with more affordable prices and aiming for high-income recipients.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taken out by individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK. The extra money should give a push to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is added in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago at leisure homes and homes purchased to be rented out. It may be located at up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will withdraw up to £120 million per year.
Approximately 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by people living outside the UK. This drives up prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new release comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by purchasing land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on housing at affordable prices to solve Britain's "surprising housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched an intriguing enough proposal for housing reforms, including tenant roofs and an end to vaults without the tenant's disgust.
He also wants to give municipalities a greater opportunity to build new homes.
Theresa May says, "Last year I said I would spend my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it can’t stand right when it’s as easy for people who don’t live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy homes as for hard-working residents in our country.
The dream of owning their home has too many people become just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact.”
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to sometime become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shots are looking forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from northeastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light last summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B national team and that was all,” Ross told BBC Scotlands Sportsound.
“But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my father, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage a club.”
Among Ross's representatives as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about succeeding such established names in such a large club. He has previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, I am considering success based on the answer to the question ‘Can I get this club back to the Premier League?’
“This club is definitely in the Premier League, given its structure and talent,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month sejour as a member of Heart’s coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from the relegation to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being close relegation to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever in his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a crossroads," he recalls and refers to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was entirely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had okay results and could live cowardly on it. In addition, I had some great successes.
Playing can be tough.
There's a lot you need to get through every week.
It’s still stress and pressure at work for me, but exercising feels completely right.
I've always wanted to exercise and now I do it. I'm feeling better than I've ever done in my adult life."

A survey shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The heatwave of the summer has increased revenue for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have gained more pressure.
Numbers showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA company, which has compiled the figures, said: “Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The reduction in the sales of restaurants by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubars and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubar offering food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just seem to want to go out and drink something.
The impact on managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month, and food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman at the Serving and Entertainment Branch analyst RSM says: “These results are a continuation of the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales in the big kitchen market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8% each year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come more uncomfortable for companies driven by food sales. Time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give some needed respit."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July. This reflects the fact that fewer new brands are now launched.
Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub bar and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyzes data on how it goes for 47 active groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teachers
A survey among 20,000 students in high school and high school shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased the concern that there is sexual content posted there.
20% of students said they had a "head account" that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create social media accounts that they keep secret to adults.
A survey among 20,000 students in high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta accounts", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has speculated on the concern that there is sexual content posted there.
20% of students said they have a clean “main account” that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled over her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager who urged others to "violate me."
According to the study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of them recognized that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the internet where parents and teachers don’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the board of the Scottish Athletic Association, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Board.
Doyle is Scotland’s most prestigious athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her wide international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle says: “I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on the BBC.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time had to show if I would recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to go again and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps that compare mothers with cow parts internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused differences on the internet with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows that are milked.
To pay attention to the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired commercial with humorous impact to show what freedom the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real mothers dance in a hay filled lad with cows to a song with text rows like: "Yes, I milk myself, but have no tail" and "If you didn't know it, this is not a juver, but tits."
"Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
However, the advertisement, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused contention on the internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it sheds light on the dairy industry's "phases".
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like we have to get pregnant and feed in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them just a few days after birth,” one person writes.

Another commentary: “You understand that it’s traumatic for both mother and child.
But, sure, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another one adds: "What a real-life advert."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
“I think this is brilliant.
I would have had one if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad movie is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“This is a great product,” someone writes.
Another commentary: “This is a fun commercial that turns to mothers pumping (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like ‘coss’.”
This is not a film that tributes or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discrete pump clogged in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be worn discretely in a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a co-owner and ECD at Mother, and she says: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk cows, we wanted to set light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while in an entertaining and easily recognizable way we show the incredible sense of freedom the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London's fashion week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk with clothes by designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of deprived migrant children has increased even though the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged. This is partly due to the fact that hetish rhetoric and hard policy introduced by the government of Trump has made it harder to place the children of reference persons.
In the past, most reference people themselves have been paperless immigrants, and afraid to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at stake by explaining themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would have to leave fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Authority, testified before Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be reference persons to unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70% of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities since before.
Nearly 80% of people who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," Albence said.
In order to deal with children's cases faster, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to be in court within a month after they were detained, rather than after 60 days, which was previously practice, according to staff at the filings.
Many of them are present on video link rather than personally to bring their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered to be entitled to protection are quickly deported.
The longer children are deprived of liberty, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to staff on the coatings and reports that have come from the system in the last few months.
Proponents say that concern rises at major facilities like Tornillo, where signs that a child has it hardly more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the plant.
They add that if children are moved to the tent town without having enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to friends can worsen the trauma many are already struggling with.
Syria demands U.S., French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country's eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian land, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They have to retreat immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem underlined that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions left their homes.
He said that the government of Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The U.S. has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that enables refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
“They are politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no aid to rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel attachment Idlib has created an opportunity to move on with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal disrupted a large-scale attack of Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed the hope that a military intervention would be targeted against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
The United Nations Embassy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon summon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition, to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set up conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the Committee and said that the group's work would be limited to "review of the articles of the present constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless his presidency ends prematurely through impeachment and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
There are no signs that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, the viewing figures on the best broadcast time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are nearly three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news nights.
“This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because that’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC’s drama “Designated Survivor,” which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a long-time comedy writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club".
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Nell Scovell told me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, reporting from Washington can determine the future of the case in the abortion issue, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly sat and looked for six hours on an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich leather for $15,000 ("a garment filled with hybris," as the Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's spouse.
I will never see Super Mario again.
"Some of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump sequel's rotating cast and daily intrigues (smuch clash with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).

When I spoke to the television producer Mr. Fleiss this week, there was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai, Hawaii, but he was sitting and owling indoors and watching MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He could not be distracted, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be faced with the Senate Judicial Committee and the Supreme Court's future was in the bowl.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning to the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside streams into the smoothest race ever before the mid-year election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district receives lots of money, thanks to a restructuring of a congressional district that has made two members now compete for the same place.
This newly renovated suburban district in Pittsburg is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who got his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were constitutionally changed to the Republicans' advantage.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign funding dispute between the major economic sections of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a scarce win in a widely watched special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a precursor.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for China support but then backed up
Diplomas noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the shareholders trembled the Trump organization’s leadership team.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "newly made decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," the Ministry spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017. The money would, among other things, go to drug control and development and constitute financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have struck the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings continued, U.S. and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials in the administration made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which effectively put an end to considerations on sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October. It is a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, said the diplomats.
And the three U.S. messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton of the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, of which two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal negotiations against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study the story
The next inevitable step could be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged assault in lawsuits, which there is now significant evidence of in public records.
Mueller is also reported to direct his investigation against whether Donald Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If Congress was to change majority, Trump will be held accountable to that assembly just as he prepares to once again stand up for the election, and perhaps finally before a citizen's jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to claim that Trump will inevitably fall. So neither his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to meet different elections, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how extinguished the game can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had resisted him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbaths that then followed.
History is about such decisive events, and the inexorable advance of democracy is either speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing several of these decisive events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what will happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he was supposed to have proposed to secretly record the president, and speculated that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times reporting is not true.
"How should we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he may join the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we, in the middle-year elections, vote for a congress that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don't think we'll fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was Czechoslovak Jewish and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off to light Sabbath lights on the table decorated with the hawkset.
With that as an inheritance, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimist before the meeting with Rapid Wien
The Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal that ended in a draw earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 match against Villarreal. But he believes that Rangers can use the result as a leapboard for greater successes.
“It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” says the 31-year-old.
“We went into the match in the belief that we could get something, and went from there with a point.
We might have gotten it in the end, but in the end it was probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we came back in the second half and were the better team.
On Thursday, it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game. They got a good result at their last game, but if we have the audience with us we can safely pull out and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep poorly because of fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be taken care of, few people talked to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the step and talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care if you don’t talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may have a significant impact on the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover the costs, or a self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford.
Establish legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts from the outset.
Establish a health care authority, so that you can appoint a trusted person who looks over your medical care and ensures that your health care professionals follow your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Also consider an authority for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that you have an ageing parent who ends up in an emergency medical condition and is on your way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
“Not only is the economy at stake, but who are the doctors?” he asked.
“What medication is it?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready.”
Man shot several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was fired several times with air rifles as he walked home from an evening out.
The victim, aged 40, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, abdomen and hand.
The police described the shooting, which took place at about 2:30 a.m., as a "single incident".
The victim did not see his attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police urge witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday.
The communications have been expelled, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Donggala administrative area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a administrative area that stretches along more than 300 km of the northwest Sulawei coast.
The management area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299 200 people in 2017.
The pillars of the province of Central Sulawesis' economy are fishing and agriculture, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickelgruvdrift is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated to Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's emergency management authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, western Donggala was also hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circumpaciphic seismic ageing, which often suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh province on the 26 December, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit Sumatra’s west coast at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra's coast.
2006: An earthquake with magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the town of Padang, the capital of the province of Västra Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Dozens of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A shallow earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya administration area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes affected the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for mistreatment.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, for suspicion of being in the home and for opposing the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska state police.
According to the police report, he reportedly took the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su Prison and is held against the $500 bail to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the bail, according to the KTUU television channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when asked to give up his attitude, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious crimes under Class A, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious crime under Class B, which is punished by a day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time Palin is accused of crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being dealt with by the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of putting himself in the notification of domestic violence and of possession of weapons under the influence of that incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which is derived from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
The electricity supply and communications are down, and the death figures are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the centre of Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hits are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York claim the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack who killed eight people. It is a rare penalty that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck from the Home Depot construction and interior chain to perform an attack on a bike path along West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan. He mead down pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
To justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious body injury, according to the deliberate declaration of death penalty lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges may result in a death sentence, according to the court case.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was prosecuted by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protection activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in the case of organized crime, as well as the abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “wide planning and purpose,” said the prosecutors, and at the same time described the way in which Saipov performed it as “abomination, cruel and inhuman.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has not been prosecuted in a case of death penalty in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted for the espionage of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed, according to the court documents, a lack of regret during the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he said to the investigators that he was pleased with what he had done.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching ISIS movies on his phone.
He also asked to put the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "except disappointed" on the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of going to life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the accused admits guilty only extends the trauma that these events have caused to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tories Member of Parliament says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "feel the heat" from the EU sceptics, when one of Theresa May's own MEPs suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative member Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that Britain should have already "drawn out" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge faced by Theresa May in bringing the deeply shared followers to reconciliation has been worsened by EU-positive tory members who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive under the attack of Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU themselves.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to make a deal with Brussels despite the backlash, and force the EU Skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "caos".
Bone said at a mass meeting that had been organized by the organization Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spoil the Chequers Agreement".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and received responsibilities during the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the wheel, we would have been out at this point," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough district of Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must spoil the Chequers Agreement."
He clarified his opposition to the EU and said: “We have not fought world war to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the allegations that the public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely false."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers Agreement is unpopular to the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and in our election workers who are out on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Put off the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she added a sharp message directed to Theresa May: "Premier ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "feel the heat" if they would betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about the trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, 'We're not going to let you get away with it.'"
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to get our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilise the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists waved with the tracks with the text "Tory Members Against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour Parliamentarian Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked the conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
“These are these people who say they can have IT systems in place and all technology for Canada plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a pure father.
“There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans a “presumably thinker” to candid the presidential post
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is going to take a "pretentious thinker about candiding to the presidential post" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been subject to speculation that she might take on Donald Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th city hall meeting with voters since Donald Trump joined.
One person asked her if she planned to candidate for the presidential post.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government.
A person arrested for the death shooting of basketball player Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the deaths of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man seen in the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near Southern University campus early on Friday.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died of this,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247 sports news site.
Wayde went between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been in the scene and had a weapon, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and taken to the police in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches with 10 starts last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after team orders gave him win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and nearly hung Hamilton out on dry when he defended his position during the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the depot first and allowed Hamilton to drive in the back of the club, which should have been crucial.
Mercedesen went into the depot a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton progressed after some wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of biding in place after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held in the decks to reach a quick finish and drive about Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
In the end, he came in the depot at the 44th lap, but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight laps when Raikkonen rose to fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let by me.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and a two,” Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, claiming that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, nominated judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual assault.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address the testimony of Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "wretched, nasty and lying."
“The only thing that could happen and the fine that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, nasty, nasty and lying,” he said.
“You see press releases and leaks and they say, ‘No, I haven’t.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Wait a minute.
"If we've leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added, and imitated the Senator.
The letter with details of Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't darkened Ford's accusations, I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wanted."
But her dementia doesn't seem to have suited the president, who, during the Saturday night's meeting, commented: "I'll tell you one thing.
She may not have done that, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual offences by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power with all the necessary means.
"They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars served on Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Belfast Giants received an early two-point lead by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard signed for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and defeated Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m. on assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intensive first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who signed at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Belfast Giants was in charge at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard resigned with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half way through the end period.
The Belfast Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
Aerial leaders died for hundreds of people on a plane to flee from earthquake
A flight leader in Indonesia is now commended as a hero after his death when he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the crash of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly sweeping control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the start track, could lift safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would rage.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian television channel ABC News.
“We arranged a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“We are devastated to hear this,” he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll can rise to over a thousand people. The country's disaster relief authority says there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death figure is believed to continue to increase as there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the authority.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in aid and supplies.
35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: “Every minute comes an ambulance with dead bodies.
It's bad with clean water.
The small markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we don't know what they will face there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” CNN said.
Indonesia was affected earlier this year by earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says a man is missing after a plane crashes in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane crashing in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean now states that a man was missing. In the past, it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had escaped from the sinking plane and were in safety.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water when it attempted to land at the airport in the Chuuk Islands.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were left in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and how the event progress looked.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing track.
Some witnesses thought the plane ran past the landing track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wander through the waist depth of water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the cabin staff panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a minor skull injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked nearby in developing a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people on land before the plane sank into the 30 meter deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor ended his pledge in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to put together the 29-year-old indicted Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers movements the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday and said he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "spokes because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis some time after Chambers' death deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its ending on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative picture of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that the hip hop has come far away from its origins in political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?
A children's girl in New York is accused of resignation after a "racist" text message
A children's girl in New York is accused of discriminatory resignation after she received a misdirected text message from her mother, who complained that she was "a black again."
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the mood with "extortion".
Two-child mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed horror when she realized that her new granddaughter Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived at her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEJ NOT A SVART Again," said Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in an SMS to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "bad to the courage", and fired Maurice, claiming that their former child girl, who was African, had done a bad job and that she instead expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in a taxi.
Now she sues the couple to get compensation for the dismissal. She demands compensation in the order of $350 per day for the job she was initially employed to do, which would be for six months and where she would stay with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she told the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple dismissed the allegations that they would be racists and said the only straight was to end Giselle Maurice's employment. They were worried that they would not be able to trust her when they had offended her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” said husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood to "extortion" and said that his wife would give birth two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to go to such a person?”
It's not very nice done," the investment banker Plasco added.
The process of justice is still ongoing, but the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticizes them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers didn't think readers could relate to a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington writer Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented the letter as follows: "It is hard to imagine how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very fun, given what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he got the inspiration of a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitter fun" after his death last year.
She describes that Paddington was a "very important member of our family", adding that her father was proud in the silence of her final success.
"He was pretty silent of himself, and not a boastful person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like having a child who succeeded in something. You get proud of the child even if it is not you who has accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a bit that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give Paddington the honour of himself."
My daughter would die, and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to do it," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died soon before and now everything was shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I could not yell or cry or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she went through.
“No one knew about it,” she said.
"I bowed down my head, and my tears ran all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Surrounding women set up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost relatives due to suicide work to prevent others from killing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up short on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, taking his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 and lives in Lydney. She tells us that her son was a promising chef who had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile brightened the room.”
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling when he had killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I constantly worry about consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "for people to know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that he was acting differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom. When the children opened their Christmas gifts, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard battle for them, but they have to get through it. "It tears up a wound in the family.
It breaks us.
But we have to fight on all of them.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we could accomplish something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - then maybe we could get some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the committee would "split" due to deep-rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their dissatisfaction depends entirely on the time.
The mid-year elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6th. If the Republicans make a bad choice, as is expected, they will be heavily weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary of George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the state of death and confirm his injunction in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "falls" under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping off to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Reunion Ministry, said that 127 people dropped out last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that harder border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges to human smugglers are important causes.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the hard-watched demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the defectors as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relations between North and South, which are technically still at war with each other, have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for talks focusing on the firmly run negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the U.S. sanctions for the lack of success since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we can certainly not disarma ourselves unilaterally first," Ri said at a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said that he was temperamentally inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the allegations of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh became very emotionally touched, and from time to time he almost shouted and the voice shouted when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, saying that the allegations against him were a "grotesque and coordinated character murder" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he is biased to the disadvantage of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked the couple Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to impeach if he was elected, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he's at now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeals in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that she as a Democrat was concerned about what decision Kavanaugh may make against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation requests, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would amend certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
It is not a place for a hysterical and biased person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud,” Pelosi said.
Women have to stand out.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she spoke to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm angry."
And so she continued.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to get outlets for anger in part because they are often misunderstood basically.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once wept of indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the collar of an older woman. It was a cool boss that I had always been a little scared of, and she drew me into a stairhouse.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and are happy they managed to push you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was embarrassed with an out-of-marriage affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of himself setting up for the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it 'Snow and the seven dwarfs'.
Since she was late, she left behind with the fundraiser, giving the promise not to go in as a candidate unless she got a total of $2 million.
It was a project convicted of failure.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she would not initiate a formal presidential campaign, she became so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism, that the voice stocked.
“You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schröder recalled the press’s reactions.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, ‘What should they write on my tombstone?’
“She was crying?”
Why the trade war between the U.S. and China can be good for Beijing
The opening path of the trade war between the United States and China was ear deafening. The war is far from over, but the crack between the countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by covering important Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion. This means in practice that half of all goods entering the United States from China are customs-plated.
Beijing has responded with the same coin every time. Recently, it was thrown at fees of between five and ten percent on US goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match the U.S. action. The world's second largest economy will probably not step down within an overseen time.
To get Washington backing means to bow for demands, but to publicly crawl for the United States would be far too genant for China's president Xi Jinping.
Experts, however, believe that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure from the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually significantly more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to admit," said Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria "redo" for returning refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to accept voluntary returning refugees and appeals for help to build the country, which lies in ruins after the more than seven-year war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
“The situation in place today is more stable and safe, thanks to our success in fighting terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and residence.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it does not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe resigned in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European ground and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team achieved the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the knockout of the 16th hole's pair 3 orbit, and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever done 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest-ranked players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked players, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
Spanjor Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the tournament's most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be helpful," said a touched Garcia after the European team's victory.
He handed over the relay stick to his countryman John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"What an incredible pride, to be able to beat Tiger Woods. I'm raised looking at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and has now scored 13-21-3 for his career in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the world's best players ever, who have won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the team's devastating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the toy.
Hats off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA Tour and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to go on.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be captain.
You have to bow and bow.
They played better than us.”
Algeblomning: Halts decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in concentrations of algae flowering for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, uneven flowers are reported in the areas around the main municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate reduced levels.
The bloom stretches along more than 20 miles of the coast, from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee.
Spots can be seen about one and a half miles into the sea outside the big municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Flowers have also been observed in the municipality of Pasco.
Mean concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida in the past week.
