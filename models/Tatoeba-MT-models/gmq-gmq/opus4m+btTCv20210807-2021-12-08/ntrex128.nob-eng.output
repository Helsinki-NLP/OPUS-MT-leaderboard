Welsh Members do not want to appear as "mutters"
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, currently known under the abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title can be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of the plans to change the name of the parliament of the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A Labour Party representative explained his group was concerned because “it rhymes on Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "dustete", and pwp means "besh".
A representative of the Wales Party Plaid Cymru said that the group in its entirety was “dissatisfied” and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said that his group was "open" for the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word "Muppet", which in addition to being the name of some famous dolls, is also a British slang word for "dust".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like an "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which currently develops laws to introduce the name change, said: “Of course, it is the members themselves who have the last right of destination in terms of which name they are to be mentioned.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh National Assembly permission to change its own name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public hearing that showed general support to rename the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
Apparently, representatives suggest other options, but getting all parties to an agreement can lead to headbreaks for parliamentary President Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a legislative draft for the name change in the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for the disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
The representatives have the latest right to vote on what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide whether their name will be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a region named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim to their territory and has, on several occasions, opposed the country's applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
The referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's stalks - the crickets of Harlem struggle
“The old ones I spoke to have told me that before, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
"Now there is none of the parts."
He said that the bar's apostasy was understandable.
“People are socially interacting with each other in other ways,” he says.
“Children are no longer the local community’s meeting places, which everyone visits regularly.”
As far as the churches are concerned, he fears that the money from selling possessions will not last as long as the leaders believe. “And sooner or later they are back at first.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches must close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both crickets were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black church that had stayed nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's received a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street — one of Harlem's main traders — because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners put plans for the reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Prest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was "the church watch of the poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historic instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also remarked that it was the first carillon in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the past couple of months is a complicated interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom are hired by the church's legislature and others of the diocese.
The Council of the Church, the Church’s leadership, consisting of legs, wrote to the diocese in July regarding its concern that the diocese would “try to force the costs” on the Council of Church, despite the fact that the Council had not been involved in the inception of the architects or entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishes complained of lack of openness on the part of the diocese.
Hai injures thirteen-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared after lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy shouted of enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but he eventually realized that the boy shouted, 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!’”
His entire collar bone had been torn up,” Hammel, who discovered the injury when he reached the boy.
"I cried that everyone had to get out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is presently in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Badevakt Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered serious injuries in the upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its intake in the UK beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warehouse-like makeup and beauty care shelves, staffed by specially trained employees.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a powerful entry into the UK’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which experiences ever-growing while the sales figures for clothing and home articles fall. If the attempt turns out to be successful, the concept will expand to several stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is the result of the supermarket’s efforts to find a new application for the space previously used for TVs, microwaves and home articles.
Sainsbury's has said they will double the number of beauty care products they offer to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the shopkeeper has never sold before.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better space in marked brand areas, just like in shops like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its Boutique makeup brand with mainly vegan products, because there is growing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores. One opened in Croydon in southern London last week, while the other opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
E-commerce and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that sales will eventually look more and more like a department store, as the supermarket takes up the fight against cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods other than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets after purchasing both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to upgrade the departments of beauty care and pharmacy goods was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration was discontinued after a dispute regarding the distribution of the income from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store merchandise to Celesio, owner of the pharmacy chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will take part in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s trade director, said: “We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty care shelves to create more welcoming surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will then be prepared to advise and help.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations make us now a beauty care competitor representing a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones is “rasing” after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is supposed to be furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37), a program manager in This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on their own new gold-brown contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “rasing” at a thrilled meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. This is where television’s golden girl admitted that her new deals — worth up to GBP 1.5 million — mean she no longer has time left to their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she will leave Truly, Jones left Britain on his way to one of her vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next few decades.
Everyone is completely shocked that she has decided to retire.
No one could believe that when it happened last Tuesday, it was just before the launch.
Now a warehouse is full of goods at Marlow's headquarters, which is now ready for sale."
Experts believe that this Morning program manager, which is among Britain’s most popular stars, may cost the company several million pounds due to large investment in products such as pillows and light, fashion and coswear, as well as a potential delay in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the last ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin hosting the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We don’t want to comment on his business affairs.”
“We fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment some would consider “small presidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I didn’t give anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big dirt on the way to nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a "similar response" from the United States to its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead, the United States has still sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a assembly of his voters.
“We are doing well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his work to improve his relationship with Kim has given positive results, such as putting an end to rocket tests, helping to get hostages released and getting the remains after U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this staggering arena, we’d have around 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia rages an island and kills hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign nonprofit organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lomboks residents had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be submitted.
“In many cases they have unfortunately made it quite clear that they do not ask for international help, so it’s quite challenging,” Sumbung explained.
Save the children now set up a team to travel to Palu, but are not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the national emergency management agency, said that Indonesian authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are to be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Taking into account the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is terribly poorly prepared to deal with the anger of nature.
Ly to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning sirens at Palu, although a warning had been issued, has probably contributed to the death tolls.
Even under the best circumstances it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made an upgrade of Indonesia’s fall-finished infrastructure a key point in his campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and rail.
However, money shortages have been a big problem for Joko's administration, which will stand for reelection next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have turned to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late league match against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from the Premier League loss against Chelsea on Saturday by scoring for the 89th minute in the game at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal while his team lay 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before sending it to the longest corner.
The experiment went high above the box as the ball valved towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually crossed a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and touching the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it on.”
Chelsea led with 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker sent a pass with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing his direction near the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's orbital half.
Kovacic made a quick handover on the midfield.
He then fired off a great breakthrough pass that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner met a left-foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the Champions League group game at 15:00 on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League for men in London at 3:00 a.m. on Thursday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia reaches 832
The death toll after Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's emergency management agency announced early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, the agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from raged buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has begun after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man is arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard something to contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan says: “We’re at the very beginning of the investigation, but I’ll ask everyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught up something on their car camera, to contact - they may have information that is essential to our investigation."
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the deceased woman was resident in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have come to the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was tireless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was overheard when he told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats “it’s so terrible” over and over again.
At 14 p.m., two police cars were behind the lock, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers were outside the block and supervised the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are asked to send an instant message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, by referring to "log 247" from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial drawn into the argument of "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures that were carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publisher as "too silly" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace would also become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s amazing representation of Cromwell is a proof of the 19th century opinions and is part of the historiography of a man many believe still deserve to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as Parliament's defender against pressure from outside - in his time there was of course a talk about the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating.”
Drapsgris kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, referred to only as "Yuan", was found dead and covered with blood from a cracked artery near a binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby swine path was open.
He said that inside the swine, there was a big wrong with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and maltracted," explained his cousin, named Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed their pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or to his cousin.
While police collected evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking someone else.
Yuan's family and market management allegedly negotiate compensation for the death.
Although it happens the source, it is not the first time it is recorded that a pig has attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to ordinary, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
“They just play.
They like to bite, and are very curious ... they are not trying to hurt anyone.
You just have to show sufficient respect.”
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the southwestern United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves across the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry flooding on its journey through North Mexico and southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind speed of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 05:00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastwards towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity northwards to southwestern United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical humidity and the tree approaching will lead to widespread heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, liquid debris and fast and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep European humidity will lead to rainfall rates of up to 5-7 cm per hour in some areas, especially areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern region, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly deteriorated conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around the desert on foot as long as there is a danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause river valleys to become widespread bruising rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to local winds that can contain dust and sand.
The trough approaching will cause local heavy rains for parts of the coast along Southern California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid debris and fast, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the area's first rainfall.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and persist all Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic becomes colder but the troops remain very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of severe temperature differences throughout Central America on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of central and eastern America will likely get a warm start in October, with degrees high in the twenties from Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday - this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that eastern America will most likely have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six television networks, saw Thursday's gripping testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that has been reported to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday's great surprise last second, when it emerged that the senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged it so that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she is 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take her clothes off at a secondary school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average viewer numbers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seeer numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems measuring office viewers.
To give a bit of perspective, this is the viewer figure that corresponds to the playoffs in the American football championship or the Oscars award.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led among the networks, with average viewing figures of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a meeting in the court committee while protesters shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with a lowered look for several minutes while being scolded, while the incident was broadcast directly on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he tells our country the truth?”
He said, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office has made a statement, and said as the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter on the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would be passed on to the entire Senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate by next week, which the Democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's elections had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans had not enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of “political game” around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to play “political games” with the UK’s future and undermine the nation’s interests.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson has continued her attack on her so-called “Chequers” plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should obtain each other’s tariffs was “very ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing LSU player's death
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) has been arrested and charged with intentional murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the basketball race.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admits to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bailout is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The trial doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a gunshot wound in the head and through the neck.
Police thank Louisiana State Police's working group for obtaining refugees, the state's police lab, the Southern University police and the locals for contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU’s athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area’s police force for his “hard work and pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "cracked" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
“This is what we fear at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano splashes ash over Mexico City
The ash splashing out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico’s public emergency prevention agency, warned Mexico’s population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity rose in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in one day.
The agency monitored several cases of buzzing and shaking.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the front routes on the cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysics have discovered increased activity from the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the Independence Vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protestors for independence had a clash with the police, while attending several thousand competing demon stations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on detachment.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police, bombarding them with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handgemeng also broke out later in the day, when police used batons to limit the fighting.
For several hours, independence protesters stood and shouted "Never forget, never forgive", face-to-face with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
Tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the 1 October referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming conviction for detachment, but it was poor attendance because the vote was boycotted by most who opposed the release.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to halt the vote conducted at electoral stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped on the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was abolished, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes about Catalonia's opportunity to become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had trouble keeping the pressure up this year, as many of their besk-known leaders have traveled in self-detained exile or are in custody while awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said the conflict is inflamed by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been imprisoned in anticipation of a trial since late last year, announced that he will be running for the European Parliament next year.
“Standing for election as a candidate in the European election is the best thing I can do to condemn the oppression and regression from democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
An armbrush may also have been fired against the car at some point.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livinston amazed Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has not yet won on the away field in the Premier League this season and will play against leaders Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will play home matches against Rapid Wien in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained undefeated through six games in the division. Chief Trainer Holt has not yet lost a game after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Misses Opportunities For His Sleepy Guests
Holt's team should have led a long time before they scored, as their direct process caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick on after sliding in to meet Craig Halkett's header past the goal.
The host allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing they could create problems for their guests at deathball.
That’s how the decisive goal came to be.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening - Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a clear track, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage, Rangers had had the ball pretty much all the time, but the home team defense had proved to be impermeable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed an almostscoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers-keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a wide short pass.
Crosses were constantly entering the Livingston box and were continually saved, while two criminal claims - once after Halkett's protest against substitute Glenn Middleton, and once by hand - were overlooked.
Phenomenal from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were amazing all of them, and continue to surpass all expectations on the way up.
The game style and crew have hardly changed since they got on top again, but Holt will have much of the honor for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing and coordinated a hugely well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the game.
The Rangers did not have my inspiration to sign up with.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was laber - they only got into the home team's field half once - and it was a bit of an uplift for the Rangers, located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
There has been a division over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police reported security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many followers showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also dismissed, criticizing both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the division that follows a man who is acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrats by others.
Deptford collision: cyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist is killed in a collision like a passenger car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the rider was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on site.
The collision takes place just one month after a cyclist died in an attack where the driver escaped from the crime scene at Childrens Street, about one kilometre from Saturday's collision.
Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus traffic are in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
Six prison officers are injured in an incident in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Revolutions broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers are brought in to handle the incident, which involves eight inmates and is limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for smaller facial injuries on site.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: “Special trained prison personnel have been sent in to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees are treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our jails - the responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind locks and hits.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader received hospital handling after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, the rebel police were called to deal with a serious incident where employees were attacked by billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (can be beneficial for drought areas)
It’s the source of Arizona hit by a tropical low pressure, but it’s probably going to happen early next week, as the hurricane Rosa’s remaining force moves through the desert regions in the southwest and brings floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain will start late Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service has stated on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or lowprints within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border.”
The latest National Hurricane Center models anticipate 5-10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some locations in Mongollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will likely get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those outside flooding, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this precipitation is likely to be beneficial, since the southwestern United States is currently in a drought condition.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona are experiencing at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category,” according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa hits land at the Mexican Peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum wind power of 137 km, located 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, thereby losing power.
This is why it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm forces on Monday evening or afternoon.
The precipitation across parts of Mexico can be powerful and cause great flooding.
“Total rainfall of 7.5-15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with opportunities for up to 25 cm of precipitation,” according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the Arizona dawn on Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, as these move on through Arizona into southern Utah within late Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected by Rosa or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and southwestern desert in the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This precipitation is expected to produce deadly flooding and liquid debris and rapid in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 4pm BST on Sunday.
He was taken to hospital, and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked anyone who may have a mobile recording of the incident to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "did under the slightness and mind" of the Democratic Party
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a referendum in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "did under the slightness and mind" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the severe and emotional accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he had committed a sexual assault on her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw how brilliant, skillful and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
“A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of the most proficient lawyers of our time, with a spotless walk in public service,” he told a gathering of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred discreetly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans voting in the middle elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of our lifetime most important choices.
“I’m not really a participant, but I’m a participant,” he said.
“That’s why I’m travelling and fighting for the best candidates.”
Trump alleged that the Democrats aim to "resist and prevent".
The Senate's first midterm vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to the assistant of a leader in the Republican Party.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunami, the figures are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out at sea by huge waves that dusted at the beaches when a large earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves evaporated land around sunset, destroyed everything in their way and drove many into the drowning death.
The tsunami came to the heels of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami father arose yesterday, people still engaged in activities on the beach, did not escape immediately and end up being victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia’s emergency management agency (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone - it took cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed up trees to escape the tsunami and survived.”
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the emergency management office showed many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and crushed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency for the assessment and use of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the power of Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as “inclusive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death toll and damage may be larger land coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely crippled, completely without information” from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people there,” the Red Cross said in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, one hears a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes plunging towards the beach, and rivers with it buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuates still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport is only open for assistance and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centres on Sunday.
The death toll after the Indonesian tsunami rises over 800.
It's awful.
World Vision staff from Donggala have come safely to the centre of Palu, where they have been searching shelter during the shelter in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed great damage on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
“They told me they saw hundreds of broken houses,” he said.
It's awful.
As aid organizations began the grim preparations to deliver emergency aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open the borders for international aid, but the situation hasn’t got any status yet.”
As the sun descends over Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that illuminate the dark news picture after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued by rescuers after spending two days under ruins with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing Paragliders for the Asian Games, which were conducted earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those trapped in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional should to wear,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes who participated in the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages resulted only in grey chopping marks, rather than a few blue chopping marks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal US$26,750 during ATM refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who filled a bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, the detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who "run up behind that Brink's employee" and stole a money bag to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects escape from the scene, according to the press release, but the police have not specified how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity must contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creation formerly known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a long time, using the name as the title of its eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she canceled on "emotional basis", according to the serial creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye — as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's incumbent president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he should never use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
Military troops fired on a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements clashed across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The United States Should Double Financial Support for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements regarding artificial intelligence, despite the US generally not having a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, in turn, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in the field of innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next major breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double financial support can double the chance that the next major performance in artificial intelligence comes from the United States,” Lee told CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the US's best Othello player, and later was a leader of Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the US government’s previous technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation of wise heads.
Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
“It’s not China that steals the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired wise heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive a residence permit offer automatically,” he said.
China's Minister of State issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions,in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. law aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been halted for several months.
Macedonian votes in referendum on whether the country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their efforts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim to Greek territory, and has vetoed to include them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has caused doubts if the attendance will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Are you for NATO and EU membership when accepting the agreement with Greece.”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that originated after the fall of Yugoslavia, to gain membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the country’s future, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, it is likely to be crucial because a high enough number of Members have said that they will comply with the results of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission has said that they had not received any irregularity reports by 13:00.
However, the attendance was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent at the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children - we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open their doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) clarified a small scene and drew up chairs in front of tents set up by those to boycott the vote.
“We’re positive to NATO and the EU, but we want to be enrolled with a raised head, not be put in the back road,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our worth.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of European integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead sorely needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think most people will be for, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become a member of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He says that a “yes” response will be a “confirm of our future.”
According to a survey released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will attend the referendum - this is lower than the required attendance.
Another survey conducted by Makedonia’s Telma TV showed that 57 percent of black people plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers past Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crushed the Brighton Defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He raced with three Brighton defenders before he got out on an open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four vegetable shirts.
He got around one defender before running from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right shoe to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal at that time.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball put inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few touches before leading Sterling towards the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the death line.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet strong.
However, the always equally competitive Scherzer hopes to stand on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff opportunities of the Colorado team, which leads over the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
Rockies won a wild card spot with a 5/2 win over Nationals on Friday night, but is still looking to secure his first division title.
Although we don’t have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to be the highest level of combat I get to play on this year.
Why didn’t I want to participate in that?”
The Nationals have not announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are supposed to be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has this season won 18 games and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts on 220 2/3 innings.
Trump People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president was discreetly referring to the situation around Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republicans voting in the middle elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big ... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant. That's why I travel around and fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this cruel, cruel group of radical Democrats, you see that happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power at all costs, and there you see the slightness and the badness.
They don’t care who they harm, who they have to overrun to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we will not give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, aims to "resist and prevent".
“And you see it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “not and bad and nasty and dishonest.”
He referred to the Senate court committee and mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, after which the public bowed loudly.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
“No, I’m waiting for one — it was very bad body language — the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They do not tolerate people who say their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a large number of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I would be censored because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding how important it is to have responsible economic policy, regarding national security, regarding Europe — ironically, similar issues that they Jeremy disagreed with former leaders about.
At the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of “softer, friendlyr” policies is long-forgotten, if at all it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I previously thought I shared many political attitudes with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, united with the nation's security or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - I receive a wealth of ugly messages on social media that require me to be dismissed, condemns downtown politics and tells me that I shouldn't be part of Labour.
And it's not just me that's been experiencing this.
I know I’m happier than some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that gender-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never let themselves cow.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how rough scalloping has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every proposal of confidence and every change to the electoral rules becomes the party narrower.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the last two years when I’m encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better.”
But that’s not why I was involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government which had led to my classroom in the public school I attended being literally fallen, I have struggled for better public services for those who need them the most, both as local councillor and minister of government.
I have never concealed my political opinions, nor in the previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East may have misunderstood my political stances or disagreements with the current management.
To those who put forward the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as the country is raging our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot grasp and understand the desire to waste time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum - it's to those I represent, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of dismissal or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best preserves your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeested Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final score a bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazing entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
They are now at the top of the table, and are the only undefeated of the ten.
Ultimately, it was as much their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they received that led to the home team's defeat, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be happy.
“We have been challenged in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy with that,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “All honor to Ayr, they were better at taking advantage of the opportunities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, with a goal kick from Frazier Climo gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, loaned from Warriors, allowed Melrose to equalize the position, and Jason Baggot performed a try without a goal kick.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty kick before he, right before a break, scored and scored a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at a break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a goal kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on the båre, and from the reboot, Ayr increased the management even more oath of a try from Stafford McDowell, with a goal kick from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, then received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the field to the fullest with a try from Bruce Colvine without a goal kick, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for coping with Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the inkast behind the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo performed a goal kick, as he did again almost all the way from reboot, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanks Gregor Henry departed for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game Star is ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the serving industry - it was recently discovered that he is named as the director of a restaurant company with a beneficiaries.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays on the popular BBC program, for which he writes and plays alongside his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The due has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning the life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to engage in Glasgow's "livable restaurant business".
“The sea is ours: Bolivia, a country without coastline, hopes the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol a riggy-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicacas to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The whole inland state of Bolivia has still recovered in memory of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody 19th-century resource conflict, and the country longs for once again to sail in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be greater than they have been in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has drive, community spirit and peace of mind, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the judgment of the International Court on a large screen in many different places in the country, hoping that the Court of the Hague will give its ruling in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile, after decades of sporadic negotiations, is committed to negotiating to give Bolivia its own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president, who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year, has also been investing a lot on Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia’s party, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The UN agency, as its team in the Netherlands, has no authority that allows them to give away Chilean lands, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The International Court’s ruling only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case was “not complicated,” according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have actually made things worse.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has wiped away any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will give "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "set an end to 139 years of disagreement, in favor of both sides."
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, has used the maritime situation as a political shackle.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“The knowledge is an opportunity to see what we have to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Secretary of State Ri Yong Ho says his country will never degrade its nuclear weapons if they can't trust US authorities.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with the promises they gave during a meeting between the two conflicting countries’ leaders in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to initiate the locked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a “want dream” that continued sanctions and American resistance to are statements that end the Korean War ever will force North Korea to knee.
The U.S. government is skeptical to accept the declaration without the initial implementation of significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to let go of an arsenal the country is likely to view as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion showcases in Paris reveal the latest in huge headwear, which is heading for a dress shop near you
If you want some big addition to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don’t need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of odd, oversized headwear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motel lions on the fashion week in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most stunning garment was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a spring-like broad brake drowning the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-dried watermelons, a wizard hat or even ananas, but they are not designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had recycled lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than the last scream.
One creation reminiscent of diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you’re looking for even more big fashion accessories, then you’re lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats can be on their way to a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right in the heels of the La Bomba, the straw hat with a half-meter-wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another great creation down the catwalk - a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the swimsuit model that wears on it.
The orange raffia box, lined with refinery and complete with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer - when the designer has had such a big impact it will be difficult to overlook the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland’s fresh oils are constantly exhibiting academic excellence, and this has persisted in 2018 with another year’s outstanding exam results. These are supported by individual and joint success in sports, art, music and other community measures.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern language is constantly a popular and demanded elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the words reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can not only stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we see that language is at the top of the table with the highest percentages of freshols.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the graduate grade A.
The data obtained from the University Council’s 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received the graduate grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that freshols in Scotland support foreign languages as a decisive skill children and young people are undoubtedly going to need in the future.
Languages such as professional elections are now valued at the same level as sciences such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the curriculum for freshols and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that for the reasons employers stated to have trouble possessing a vacant position, 17 percent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will provide real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those associated with emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered the most valuable for the UK on the way to 2020, e.g. Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from on freshols, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish freshols aim to create a learning environment that will prepare and equip them with the knowledge and abilities they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that languages are constantly crucial to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills”.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and award for Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is still not decided.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game pre-season plan.
“I don’t need pre-season matches at this stage of my career,” he replied.
Time of Trump's West Virginia People's Meeting, YouTube channel
President starts a number of elections tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five scheduled public meetings in the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the referendum for his elected Supreme Court candidate is on hold, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming middle elections, since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump’s West Virginia meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's referendum in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 7:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view Trump's public meeting in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault.
The main objective of all these referendums is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has said that these five conventions over the next few weeks aim to “incite volunteers and supporters as Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Congress control is so crucial for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move towards a busy campaign season,” Reuters told Trump a campaign spokesperson who did not want to be named.
The evening's crowd meeting, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh press," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind on the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost to the polls,” said Simon Haeder, an expert in political science at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows battle spirit to retain faith as they enter Sunday's single-game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's afternoon foursomes may have been exactly what this year's Ryder Cup needed.
Momentum’s fluctuating pendulum is a fully fictional sport concept, yet something the players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points and now there are four, so we probably carry it with us as a bit of momentum," said Jordan Spieth when he left the field for the day.
Europe will, of course, have the advantage - they lead with four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel they have gained some wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebrations grew higher as his round continued, and sank to a decisive put to raise the match to a tie when he and Thomas lay two under after two.
His put, who won them the game at 15, was faced with a similar scream - of the sort that shows that he still doesn't believe the American team is chanceless.
“We really just have to put all the cloths to and focus on our own match,” Spieth said.
That’s all that the player has now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who is undoubtedly Ryder Cup's great success story.
Europe’s unusual but lovely couples have four out of four and don’t put a foot wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple to avoid a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogey’s Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the vibrant crowd makes it clear that they are Sunday's biggest competitors, and there are no other players the audience will see assure a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
I prefer both at the same time, in each hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson hampered easily with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was partner with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles over the first nine holes, the Spanish and the Swedish were so far behind that they had no chance of taking back the forefront.
On Sunday, there is no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at closely due to the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the battle spirit of some, especially in the United States, has missed.
Europe leads 10-6 at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong forefront at the start of Ryder Cup's final day, after completing Sunday's fourballs and foursomes matches with 10-6 leadership against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led off with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, raising their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, which struggles to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unlucky side in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they couldn’t catch back any of the pre-stage.
Jim Furyk's side must pick up eight points from Sunday's 12 singles game to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have been nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the only couple to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they collaborated seamlessly to defeat broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more repressive 5&4.
Woods, who got through two matches on Saturday, glimpsed to sometimes, but has now lost 19 of their 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the fourballs of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this hot day with light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, a team has managed to get in after a four-point advance at the start of the single game, but as current holders only need Furyk's side to achieve a draw to keep the trophy.
But after being the second best for two days, they don’t seem to be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will “in no way” agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s Secretary of State told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened the distrust of the United States, and that the country would in no way agree to unilaterally let go of its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual general meeting that North Korea has implemented “significant charity measures” over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We haven’t seen a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not completely reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim vowed to work against the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War which took place from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on “nuclear disarmament first” and raises pressure via sanctions to achieve its objective of coercion, and even opposes the “declaration of the end of the war,” according to Ri.
“The belief that sanctions can force us in the knee is a wish dream for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second hit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If the other party in this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as locked as it is.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland U.S. with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after Mr. Onde President Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the UN this year and praised Kim for being brave enough to take down armour steps, but said that much work remains, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is the atomic assassination.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he had no time frame for this, saying, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures implemented.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced severely and without exception, until we have attained complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to plunge the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn’t go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had progressed, but only hours after accused North Korea of making "gangsterous claims".
North Korea committed to a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile area as well as a nuclear facility if the United States took "similar measures".
He said Kim had said that these “similar measures” he wants were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures for normalizing the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by coping with the growing unculture of pugging through the night with caffeine drinks as fuel.
An academic found that the students at the world's best universities often did not have the idea of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the effect that sleep deficiency has on learning.
“After the talk, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why hasn’t anyone said this before?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains students how important it is with good sleep habits in order to perform academic and sporting, and for the general state.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of University Health Services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw students suffering from severe sleep deficiency.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a dormitory room, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance is affected by sleep deficiency, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to pup all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deficiency being an increasing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be the student’s “secret weapon” against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said — even as a means of weight gain, as sleep deficiency puts the brain in starvation mode, leading to constant hunger sensation.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the classes of the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master students to take a similar study programme before enrolling at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students put on an alarm for when to lay down as well as for when to get up, and that they had to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light can interfere with daily rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Goals of Menga beat Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another away loss when Dolly Mengas scored Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to win its first victory since February's 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager and left his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and Rangers never managed to compensate.
Rangers now falls into sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble in fermentation for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown from the away audience.
Gerrard made eight laps on the team, sweeping past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased with how his well-trained team defeated his opponents.
Rangers might have the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder lost the chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target bar.
Rangers took control, but it looked like their game leaned more on hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos said he was going to have a penalty kick after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson refused this.
Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first place, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not get trouble with Lassana Coulibalys header and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis opening in the 34th minute may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, Rangers could not handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player's exchange gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the kind of game they like, as Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the last half, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton probably had a late claim for a penalty kick as he ended up in conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson saw away.
The Almanac: The Inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we now know as the geiger counter.
The Geigerteller has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of popular culture via the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a geiger counter, finding radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals emits.”
Evans: "I'm going to say it makes sound now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention he named lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
Cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancers and then injected into the patient again.
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then these cells are injected into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results suggest that we have a highly promising vaccine.”
HER2 "drives growth of different types of cancers", including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and "trained" to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, made a fierce defense of Trump after the SNL appearance.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was bowed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a fabulous appearance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he longed out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then he says, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’”
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee for the allegations of sexual assault that Christine Blasey Ford presented.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded in social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the public that he was hearing it in the back room regarding the choice of headwear.
"They bullied me.
They said, “Don’t go out there with that hat.”
They mobbed me!
“And then they said I don’t understand what reality is,” he said.
West continued: “Do you want me to see what reality is?” he said, saying that he was going to “take on the Superman coat, because then no one can say what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try love.”
His comments were bowed at least twice, and the employees working at SNL looked embarrassed, Variety reported, where a staff member told: “The whole studio was deadly.”
West was brought in as the last little replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: THANK YOU STAY THE IMOT MASSES.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "who he is and it's absolutely amazing".
“But I choose not to reward anyone by purchasing his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) which I believe cultivates and scouts ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
“We are, too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was "the creature formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion. Then, of course, it is the late music legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Aimed for murder attempts for stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The aim is expected to be presented to the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The opinion will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington extends out against "Gasp masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of sword swinger Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles on film often causes young men to think they need to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was very concerned about the theme.
“It’s a lot of worry for me at the moment — where did masculinity go wrong?” he said.
“How have we raised men in terms of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may have part of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the highly masculine roles.
He continued: “What is congenital and what is taught?
What is conveyed on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel like they have to cultivate just this side by being a man?
I think that’s one of the really big questions of our time — how can we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any precursor or successor of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play the main role in a remake of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recordings, so that way something good came out of it - my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, for whom Kit's character Jon Snow is in love, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 800,000 people have been affected in the country, says health representative.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, which marks a change from earlier.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the disease infection is due to insufficient protection by sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, China’s authorities have promised public access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects leaked data about Republican senators, fnyss of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected on Saturday allegations that members of her staff had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured by the allegations was made by “ultraconservative” commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more repudiable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The published information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the assault charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was tracked to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and a regular lie,” Waters continued.
"The members of my staff - who have been compromised by their identities, personal data and security as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations - had absolutely no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and a regular lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, among others by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is aggressive,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
You can't go to defense.
You must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They have to act calmly and concealed.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing aggressively during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the middle elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big, if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "relevant authorities and police about these false accusations".
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are revealed,” she continued, “and that they are held responsible for all actions that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff.”
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - Bloody Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit drawings in all new films with a British backlash and it seems appropriate for this revival of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurrected in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the sarcastic self-satisfaction of how obviously hopeless we are become the nation’s new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and the rubber face has been renewed his license to mess it up for the second time - his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with a non-English-speaking cinema audience.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a deceleration of Mr Bean, and a portion of that guy who contributes one note to the musical entry with fire truck theme during the 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role that Atkinson played in the long-forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There are some great moments in the latest Johnny English flight.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades sneaked his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy comes to his right, but humor feels quite bloody and strangely redundant, especially now that the “serious” brands like 007 and Mission Impossible have a feature of comedy.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and for me Johnny English's fades aren't as inventive and pointed as Mr Bean's silent film loops.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the UK's super-secret web network of spys and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the guard-in-law agent - a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a prime minister, a pompous and depressed figure that already undergoes a complete crisis of political impopulation: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this liksom-Teresa-May role, but the script doesn’t give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform me that since every active spy has been revealed, she must bring some among the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobby establishment, but provides unofficial teaching in secret intelligence. There are some funny sequences here, when English offers a rocka academy for spy activity.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, sliced with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class lady role in which Vicki Pepperdine is slightly wasted.
So Batman and Robin's style of messing everything up for the queen are back, where they confront with Olga Kurylenko amazing femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the lumber Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey with farish side-step: disguised as waiters, they set fire at a flashy French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but yet so loving and noisy it is so there is a lot that resembles children's TV with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I could only think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he can really use his talent?
Labour denies that they are preparing plans to let the British work four-days week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day work week - but get paid for five.
The party will apparently use savings on the revolution of artificial intelligence by giving employees an extra weekday free.
This will mean that the employees receive a three-day weekend, while they receive the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of employees.
The trade unions support the transition to four-day week so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits with the party’s desire to allow the pendulum to fluctuate to the workers’ advantage — in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. The Green Party promised the four-day week during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary election.
The idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said, “A four-day week is not the party’s policy, and is not something that is being considered by the party.”
Financial policy spokesman for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless executives” and “profitors” of public service providers.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not getting back the entire shareholding because a Labour government can make “deductions” from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the corporate boards and set up employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity of companies in the private sector to the employees, which can receive an annual dividend of £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI review of Kavanaugh can make them change their minds
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings may cause some Republican senators to change their views.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked in "60 Minutes" Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, obscure, unambiguous".
Graham's voice seems to be cut into stone.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and that would have to be an inspiring finding," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denies it energetically," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of them she mentioned could not confirm it.
It's been 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped fight poverty?
This Saturday is New York hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicating the world's poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will make thousands of people flow to the big lawn of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also increase awareness around the event's real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by making more people work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions”, such as voluntary work, send email to a world leader, take a phone or in other meaningful ways to increase awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for changes, or just enough a case of so-called “clicktivism” - that people feel they contribute great by signing a petition on the web or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from their supporters, with a wealth of different goals.
They say these actions have helped make world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding has hitherto had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the United Kingdom to “help children exploit their full potential” and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador to the Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 action in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, “what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult way — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the important civil rights and anti-aparteid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year’s New York event, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. may use the Navy as "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports - the Interior Minister
Washington may "if necessary" turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including in the Middle East, from revealing US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially when operating after the invitation of the legal government — is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the south flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to handle this.
“The U.S. has through the navy the ability to make sure the seaways are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that profiles itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, noting that they are far from the same.
“The economic option towards Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one trick pony” with an economy that depends on fossil fuel.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the far cheapest option for European consumers.
According to Trump, employees in the Trump administration, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project The North European gas pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the “captain of Moscow.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s glowing opposition to the project is only motivated for economic reasons and is an example of fraudulent competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose supplier,” Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States’ position has faced resistance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have major problems with third countries that interfere with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the leader of BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” on his 2020 presidential candidateship,” Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "think seriously" on whether she would run for president after the middle elections.
During a vote meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she will run.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix the shacked government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
"After 6 November, I will seriously think about whether to run for president."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said he "led the country in the wrong direction".
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI review before voting.”
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the Senator should not run, according to a poll from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's PTSD at Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after enlisted in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with a home violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after coming home, I’ve shared with other families experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with him,” she told the public at a voters’ event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “elefant in the room” and said about his son and other veterans: “They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their soldiers and airmen and all other members of the military have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with violence in the home of a woman with a report on home violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police in Wasilla.
18 states and D.C. support testing of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented a briefing from the amicus curiae (friend of court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The entire name of a plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union laid down in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner “and his violent gang member sons” abused her, but government officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have extensive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the Court of Appeals for immigrants who gave undocumented immigrants who fled from home violence permission to apply for asylum.
State Attorney Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “looks away from decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires all asylum claims to be determined based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban is contrary to that principle,” said the briefing from amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the briefing that policies that refused immigrants access harm the US economy and say that there is a high probability that they become entrepreneurs and “supplies with needed labour.”
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims fleeing home violence and gang violence in June.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view,” Sessions said in the statement on June 11.
Asyl was never meant to reduce all problems — even all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu - deaths are doubled in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It was very excited,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her feverish son at an evacuation center in the confined city of Palu.
“All the time you see ambulances that pick up the dead.
Clean water is deficiencies."
You could see residents who came to broken homes and eased through water-injured assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were injured in the magnitude of 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sit outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shaken the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves safely.
I was squeezed by the wall that collapsed, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife shouting for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "trakassering" with "propaganda ads"
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper that distinguished the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the annex China Daily paying to move into the Des Moines Register, the most-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accused China of attempting to intervene in the U.S. Congressional elections on 6 November, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to influence the U.S. elections marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, US officials said.
It is normal for foreign authorities to use ads to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new tariffs on each other's import goods.
China’s penal duty in the early trade war was to hit export firms in states like Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts reported.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading post in Sunday’s Des Moines Register: “China is now stepping up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities exploit the freedom of speech and the open press that we enjoy in America to put a paid ad into the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast — at the avischian on the street here in Beijing, you won’t find many divergent opinions and won’t experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese around China’s problematic economic rate, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers declined the offer to publish” his article, although he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters before the middle election with the Kavanaugh fade, warns analysts
As many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received several accusations of sexual assaults targeted, analysts warn that they will receive a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings about this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move on with the vote.
“These things cannot be withdrawn,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) proposal for an FBI review in the last second will be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events — they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming!" while demonstrating the gangs of the Senate when the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move on with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“People say it has already been high, that’s true.
But it could have been higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, which often do not vote even if they dislike the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony that gave detailed description of the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts believed that it would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
"This has become a blessed mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), in early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final approval, or if Kavanaugh is put in - it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that promotes the election of Democratic candidates, to the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41% of respondents were completely or quite convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh’s production.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
The FBI is investigating the claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh in drunken condition committed her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitalia to her while at a party during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web developer plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, launches a start-up to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology doctor’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
At Solid, users can choose where their data should be stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said about the start-up.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data storage online” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, worklists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser at once.
What’s unique about the personal data storage online is that it’s entirely up to the user who should have access to that kind of information.
The company calls it “personal authorization through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company should run with resources, process and relevant expertise to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers on contract to work on the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don’t talk to “Facebook and Google that they’re going to introduce something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely converted overnight.
“We do not ask for your permission.”
In a post on Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic in terms of the next era to the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Victoria Cross Recipient from World War I
The only priest in the English church to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann was awarded the honor on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a "good symbolism" in the fact that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September, "through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the shooting line and led the line "with great courage" ahead before storming a field gun himself and knocking out three of the departments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the corps Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he "feel very honoured to play a role in the parade," adding, "the captivity of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people."
MMA supporters were up all night to see the Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine that you’ve stayed awake all night to see the tightly packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you won’t see the main game.
The San Jose participant managed 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were seated to moonlight when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to see the match.
On Twitter, a follower described the transition to the children's program as "a kind of sick joke".
“There is state regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programs at 6:00, so they had to turn over to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked for the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the broadcasting plan to include the viewers of Storbrtannia in the future.
“I think we can find out about it for the rematch,” Coker said.
"But it's at six in the morning on Sunday there, and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe with - when we put over, there went many messages back and forth, and they were not exactly of the friendly variety.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it was not, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five games - which we usually send - and we tried to stretch far for the followers, but tipped over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
Olympic stumpman Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of minority to everyone because of his sexuality — but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it wasn’t until high school he realized that “he wasn’t like others.”
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of gay people to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular program manager for the traditional program, Kirsty Young, is to be gone a few months due to illness.
Daley was a little lost on Laverne's first broadcast and said he felt "less worth" than anyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of being lessworthy and different have been the real motivation and have me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he “was something,” he said, so that he didn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice the bronze winner of the Olympics and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador. He spent his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Delegates in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands up because he feels lucky that can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "surprise me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you undergo so much at such a young age" - he attended his first Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was tough to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, until a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole perspective had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about I just had to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than a gold medal in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had purchased tickets to London in 2012 — since he wanted to sit on the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit on the first row,” he said.
“I kept his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a home audience at the Olympics, the best feeling ever," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud of Heather Small - which meant a lot for him in the run-up before the Olympics and still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs attend BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formsweak Mickelson taken out to the Ryder Cup golf tournament Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will score a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to get in shape if it is not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the centre of events, as he had so often been for the United States, it shares five times the major-winning day between being cheerleader and working on his game on the rank in the hopes of correcting what is scratching.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of his career and is not in perfect form for the tight Le Golf National track, where the long rough area continually punishes wild strokes.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson faces in the ninth game on Sunday, even British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 singles games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s games can turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has great self-confidence.
He is a "Hall of Famer" and has added so much to these teams earlier, and this week.
I didn’t think he was going to play two games.
I looked for myself more, but that’s how it ended, and that’s how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation added some intellectual values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, and likes to run grains with others. He’s a great guy to have in the teamroom,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership will soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant leadership at the entrance to the last day's singles game in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the vessel attracted the victory with the least possible margin, 141-2-131-2.
“You constantly remind yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only solitary,” said Bjørn, photographed after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else that this is not over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have received the points on the board.
We have one goal, and it’s trying to win this trophy, and that’s where the focus lies.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side — the best golfers in the world.”
Bear is delighted with how his players have made it on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t have done better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that stand in the center, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, your achievements as a golfer are tested to the fullest.
It’s the message that you need to convey to the players, that they need to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjørn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to make his players perform better individually than they did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk has himself been on both sides of the big revolutions last day. He was on the winning team at Brookline before ending up as a loser when Europe performed the "miracle at Medinah".
I remember every damn word of it,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had ravaged his players at the entrance to the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you’d like to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts a great pressure on the middle games.
We arrange our setup then and send out the people the way we feel. You know, we're trying to create something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the player order.
“I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way,” Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship delayed once again
German navy's latest frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it will not happen until early next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the drivership of the brand-new frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesperson.
The vessel was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered back in 2007, will replace the old fregatts of the Bremen class.
It is agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to apply the latest fregats for up to two years away from home port.
Continuous delays, however, mean that the advanced warships — they were said to give Germany strength on the sea — will already be outdated before being put into service, Die Zeit reports.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel in operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media mentioned a number of important “software and hardware defects” that made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older fregats in the Bremen class.
It was also uncovered that the ship has a huge overweight, reducing performance and limiting the navy's ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7000-ton heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag on the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also started to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached dizzying €3.1 billion — from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems around the new frigates are particularly important in light of fresh warnings that Germany's naval force shrinks.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government's defense committee, confirmed that the navy is actually "empty of useful ships".
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were out of range, but no new vessels arrived.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
National Trust steals the secret life of bats
New research carried out at a land property in the Scottish highlands will reveal how bats use the landscape in the hunt for food.
There is hope that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help design future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow regular bats and dwarf bats, as well as brown-launch and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Experts’ sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and which species do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be implemented, such as planting pastures and how best to care for the forests of bats and other associated species.
The flagermus population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has sunk considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affect breeding sites and restriction of habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attacks from huts.
Flag mice are not blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echo localization to find insects and obstacles on the road when flying.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly conduct surveys, surveys of breeding spaces and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only own bat reserve at Threave land property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave we have a perfect area for bats,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He emphasizes the importance of mapping the bats before maintenance is carried out on a property, since the inadvertent destruction of a single breeding space can kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps destroy a whole local population.
Flag mice are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disrupt them or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help in their work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species, we simply don’t know how the populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as “false news” and says that people “want fame” by using his name.
His lawyers will sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $355,000 in the aftermath of keeping close about the incident, Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the allegations as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” says five times winner of the Golden Ball into the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's normal.
They want fame by giving my name, but it's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and I’m fine,” adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the allegations they have called “an unacceptable representation of suspicions in the private sphere,” according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the football player will demand compensation for “the reputation damage to an extent equivalent to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years.”
The alleged event took place in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the District Court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% a good man" who was betrayed by the "one percent".
The documents show Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken in hospital, but later they concluded settlements outside the court because she was “lived of revenge” and also worried about “being publicly detained.”
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to put the settlement aside because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault, moving this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain “will mourn forever” over losing automakers
Britain "will mourn forever" if they lose the status of world leader in automobile production after Brexit," business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, they would stop production temporarily at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that the consequences of delayed border crossing at any Brexit without a deal could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, in my view, we will experience the production at our factory stopping," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other British manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement in terms of how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they will close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is about what the car manufacturers say is the supply chain risks of any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of “order as needed” and it comes every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be a stay at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day inventory at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's Brexit plan for further connection with the EU is "presistly designed to avoid such checks at the border".
“We have to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that makes us, as I say, not only enjoy success at the moment, but that we take this opportunity,” he said on the BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also from other automakers, is that we must certainly be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that increased costs in the long term will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually lead to a loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never return.”
A government spokesperson said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "exposed another week" while the fight around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervised by Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in the elections, relations between Trump associates and Russia, as well as possible impediment of trial by the President.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the Deputy Minister of Justice or not, and thus threaten Mueller’s independence, has for many months nailed up during the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of addressing the talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was resigning voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time in the UN in New York, would take place Thursday.
Trump said he “did rather let go” to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoid colliding with the Senate Judicial Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI review of one week on charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week’s delay because of everything that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always keen to keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists will dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Program creator Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to the reluctance to television-reported “self-goodness,” although she added: “I don’t disagree with the fact that they are self-good.”
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
“The president is making more questionnaires than any previous presidents,” she said, adding without giving evidence: “We’ve looked at the figures.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, "If the press gets the chance to question the President of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We try to make it happen often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often in recent weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause when he made a solo race and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and a desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member of Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the costs of application for residence and work permits for EU citizens who work in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Debates between the UK and the EU on release have taken place over the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up the preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this has to be a very difficult time for all of you.
I will therefore repeat now how much I appreciate the efforts of each individual employee, regardless of nationality.
Collaborators from all over the EU, and outside, add valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health care services for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Defense player at the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent urgent surgery after having a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 losses to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in Tennessean newspaper.
Tennessee States head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half was over.
"He came out on the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no information on the type/scope of the injury yet" and Tennessee State attempts to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before finishing the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be spent to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters
Document fee increase will be claimed from those who do not pay tax in the UK
Investigators expect it to increase up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK - and the extra money will be spent to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters with promise to offer more affordable homes and frame high-income groups.
The document tax increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK. The extra money will strengthen the government’s action to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The surplus — which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on housing number two and housing purchases for rent — can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the UK. This drives up prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot within the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spiritual cities” because of the many foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson made a proposal for a reduction in the document fee to help more young people own their own home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping housing prices high by purchasing land without using it, demanding that Theresa May reject quotas on affordable housing to resolve Britain's "damaging housing policy".
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an intriguing array of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unfounded drafts.
He also wants to give municipal councils more power to build new homes.
May said, "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create themselves a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For very many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and the unworthy situation for the homeless persists.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland
Sunderland's chief Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scotland is pleased with the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there’s always something that pulls me back.
However, that opportunity would only come if I succeed in the club management.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League."
From the structure and facilities of this club, they certainly belong to the Premier League," he said.
It’s not an easy task to get it there, but I’ll probably just consider myself to have succeeded here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in the leadership for three years, after a period as Assistant Chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month short appearance in Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa regain himself from downs to third division and helped St Mirren from the brink of downs to win the championship following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real road gap,” he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, created me a reasonable income of it and experienced some nice highlights.
Soccer play can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it with regard to stress and pressure at work, but the management feels perfectly right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do it. It feels like the most comfortable I have known throughout my adult life.”
You can hear the full interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
Perfect time for a half-liter is 17.30 on Saturdays, survey shows
The summer heat wave has strengthened revenue for Britain's hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a sales increase of 2.7% in July - while the income for restaurants fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a corporate consultant, CGA, summarized the figures, said: “Continued sunshine and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup led to July following a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when the pubs went up 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Drinking-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger equal than what restaurants went down.
Pubs with food serving also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6.6% that month, with food serving decreased 3%.”
Paul Newman, analyst from the hotel and restaurant RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports and social events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales on the market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still have difficulty, and a sales fall of 4.8% year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of ongoing cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food serving businesses, and time will show if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will give a long-awaited breathing space.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the braking of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, industry sales controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of £9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed pages of “fake Insta.”
The news has raised concerns about sharing sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they show their parents.
One in five children - some are only 11 years old - creates accounts on social media that they keep hidden from the adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake Insta” accounts — a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has raised the concerns that sexual content is shared.
20% of students said they had an innocent “main account” that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to “violate me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC for private schools, revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is terrifying that so many youths are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “Athletes’ Voice” in the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of the Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role on the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her extensive experiences at international level over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide athletic environment, and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will enjoy getting her into the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and has a total of four Olympic gold medals. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after she suffered a transient ischemic seizure she failed to go.
She tweeted: “A month ago today I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said only time will show if I want to be restored and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m really good again and I’ve learned to go again, and today I’m doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ad that compares mothers with cows divides public opinion online
A breast pump company has split the public opinion online with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump to be carried close to the body,” Elvie, the technology-based consumer commodity company, published a fresh and flirting, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump provides active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of high and cows to a song with the following text: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see any tail” and “In case you didn’t realize it, this is not jur, it’s my tits.”
The choir continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bowls.”
However, the ad, published on the company’s Facebook page, has created storms on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received blended reactions from viewers, many say it paints the “gruliness” of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth,” one wrote.

Another commented: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, hey, why not use them to advertise for a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “What a failed ad.”
Others defend the ad, and a woman admitted that she thinks the song is “unbelievable fun.”
“I think it’s a great idea.
I'd love to have one if I'm still breastfeeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product,” he wrote.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at mothers pumping (often at work or toilets) and feeling like “cues.”
This is not an advertisement that tributes or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and gets fine space in a breast-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, keep the baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to put spotlights on breast pumping and all the challenges, while in a entertaining and recognizable way we show the incredible sense of freedom the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border secretly
The number of detained migrant children has gone into the weather although the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children at supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been unproven immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other household adults had to enter fingerprints and that the data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Authorities, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to be a supporter of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no former criminal record.
Nearly 80% of the people who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to persecute these people,” Albence said.
Employees attempt to handle their children faster and introduced new rules that indicate that some of them must meet in court within one month after being arrested, and not 60 days that were the previous standard, according to receiving workers.
Many will be portrayed through video conference instead of meeting up personally to bring their case of residence permit for an Immigration Judge.
Those who are considered unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of getting anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have emerged in the sewage system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who struggle easier are overlooked due to the size of the plant.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without having enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can enhance the trauma many already struggle with.
Syria asks U.S., French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the UN General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces stayed illegally on Syrian soil under the cover of combating terrorism and "will be treated thereafter".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror so to say is over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on the run.
He said Damascus will continue to “bring this holy battle until we have cleaned all Syrian territories” for both terrorist groups and “all foreign presence.”
The U.S. has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counselling of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
When it comes to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused “certain Western countries” of “spread irrational escape” that causes refugees to stay away.
“We have approached the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing what is really a pure humanitarian situation.”
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for rebuilding Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the rebel's last major defense position at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political conversations.
The Russian/Turkish treaty prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where there are three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hopes that military action will be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al-Qaeda affiliated Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to summon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem made conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to "the review of the articles of the present constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Wants to Win Another Period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope for, impeachment and scandal end the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic conclusion of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of seerrightness.
Since 2014, viewing figures for best broadcast time have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the cable seer numbers with a total of 3.5 million viewers on evenings of big news issues.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don’t understand anything,” said Neal Baer, program manager for the ABC drama “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedian and writer of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him to vote for Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
There is an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the actions that take place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Disclosure is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened person when you stay sitting for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep dip in background fabric" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with ostrich spring worth $15,000 ("a garment spitted with hybris," said the Washington Post) and the accompanying of the Great Daniel's description.
I don’t want to look at Super Mario in the same way.
"Some of what he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the daily director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the "Pawn Stars", about Trump show's varying cast and daily twist on the plot (crangle with the NFL, shame Kim Jong-un).

When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27 °C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he burshed in and looked at MSNBC while picking up CNN.
He could not tear himself loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh meets the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake.
"I remember when we made all the crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the smoothest intermediate choices of the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district experiences a stream of money after a conversion of a congressional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This recent suburban district in Pittsburg runs with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a supplication election last spring.
Lamb faces another sitting representative, republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, who greatly overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was retracted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were a constitutional manipulation of constituencies in favour of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race on campaign funding between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a button victory in a closely followed supplication election for Pennsylvania's 18th district to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a little leadership.
United States Considered Criminal Measures Against El Salvador for Support to China, Then Threated the Threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team to the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to recall the U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Ministry spokesperson, in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalty measures were only assessed against El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed criminal measures, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder figures.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a top-level conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
By mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now prepared to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, to show the importance the administration adds to the collection, said the diplomat.
And the three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or criminal measures from Washington.
A spokesman at the White House for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the prerequisite of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next nail in the coffin may be special advisor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible impediment of law enforcement, which is now very solid evidence for in public documents.
Mueller is allegedly also expanding the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign worked with Russia in interference with our elections.
If Congress was to change side, Trump would be held accountable in that body, in the midst of the preparations to meet the voters again and perhaps finally a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors and I do not mean to claim that Trump's fall is inevitable - nor for his counterparts in Europe.
Choices must be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean which will affect how long the game will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had risen up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The course of history revolves around such flipping points, and the inexorable March of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are faced with several of these moments now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's review?
Rosenstein has been in harsh weather ever since this newspaper reported that he last year suggested secret cancellations by the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recently launched FBI review of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible abuse charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle election of a Congress that will make Trump accountable?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don’t think we’ll fail because of the experience I got in Prague.
My mother was Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the chicken cross.
With such an legacy, how can I stop seeing optimistic on our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, assured that victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he thinks the Rangers can use the result as a jumpboard to make bigger things.
“It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game and thought we could get something and got one point with us.
Maybe we could have nicked in at the end, but the tie was probably a fine result.
They were better in the first place and we came out in the second and were the best team.
On Thursday, there will be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home audience in the back I am sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, put the previous season behind us and get it to it.”
Women lose their night's sleep due to the fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be taken care of, few people talked to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they do nothing to take that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care if you don’t say what you want in advance.
Discuss with the advisor and family where and how the care should be given. Such choices can be of great importance in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
The long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-assurance with your own assets - if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Remove legal problems immediately.
Get a health care authority in place by appointing a person you trust to keep track of your medical care, and make sure that your health care professionals will comply with your wishes if you would be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your finances.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write out the details in an overview so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake — who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medicines do you need?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that overview in place.”
Man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air guns when he was on his way home after a night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "unreverted act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamies in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Donggala regentship, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regentship that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regentship, an administrative region below the province level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the beams of the central province of Sulawesis economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Ildringen in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 266,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit south Java, Indonesia's most populated island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands, outside Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that raged dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the regent Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while the people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by coincidental buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes strike Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested after charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested after assault charges.
Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, clashing with a report on domestic violence and opposing arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he reportedly took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
Palin is imprisoned in Mat-Su jail and is arrested for an uninsured debt letter worth $500.
He was pronounced in court on Saturday, declaring himself “not guilty, absolute” when asked how he put himself to the guilt issue, the network reported.
Palin is confronted with three offences of Class A, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and imposed a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of an offence of Class B, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is brought to Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, clashing with the report on domestic violence and holding a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit near central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social media showing the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami plunged into the beach.
Federal prosecutors seldom seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect for the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare penalty that has not been exercised in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to perform an attack on a bike road along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he chilled down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutor must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “deliberately” and caused serious body damage intentionally, according to the notice of intention to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury dropped the 22-point count, including eight charges of murder in connection with money-extortion, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in matters of organized crime, and a charge of violence and wreckage of vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and intention," said prosecutor, who described the way Saipov performed it as "secret, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injuries, property and losses for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states the notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a case that could give the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
Last time the death penalty was conducted in a federal case in New York City, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to perform espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no regret in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he was pleased with what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on mobile, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He did not plead guilty after the 22-point charge.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and lifetime in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a demonstration at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians would be “feeling the pressure” of the Euroscepticists - when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain would have been "outlined" now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile its deeply split ranks has been emphasized by pro-Remain Tories who participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fights to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she will go on to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force Euroscepticists and Labour to choose between her package and "caos".
Bone told the Solihull protesters that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and received responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I want to stand on for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit plan".
When he was going to explain his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed allegations that the referendum had changed since the 2016 vote: “The assertion that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: “I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular in the public. The opposition is not going to vote for it. It is unpopular in the party and in our activists, who are actually those who tracing the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening".
In a direct message to May, she added: “Ministers keep the job when they keep their vows.”
Farage stated that politicians would be “feel the pressure” if they were thinking of betraying the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now about the trust between us - the people - and that politicians," he said.
“They try to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to let them know they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilise the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before having a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists waffled with Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app as the conference started.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete daddy.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren seriously considers running as presidential candidate
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she wants to “consider seriously running for president” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke of the future during a Town Hall meeting in the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been central to speculation if she is going to run against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors, who have used the town hall format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time that "women get to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman on top."
Arrest after Sims of LSU was killed by shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting incident that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in his head and died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the spot and carried weapons, and he admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Chamber.
Sims was a two-metre high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton faces the world championship after stallords give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stallordre would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and swept closest to Hamilton off the field while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in to the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue driving in the rear of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove himself up after some shoveling with the wheels making the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free after a double-pass to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the field and came in at number seven at the end of the first round of her 21st birthday.
Then he led in much of the race while lying on the wheels to try to get to a quick finish and overpower Kimi Raikkonen, who was number four.
He finally came across the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
“The team has done a fantastic job to get a good fool,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her arrest that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
“The only thing that could happen and the gorgeous thing that has been going on in the last few days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and talk false,” he said.
“When you look at extraditions and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I haven’t.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked."
Hey, wait a minute.
“We leaked... no, we didn’t leak,” he added, with an imitation of the Senator’s voice.
Feinstein was sent the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein refused that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked for.”
But her denial was not graciously taken up by the president, who, during the party event on Saturday night, commented: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power with all the necessary means.
You see the madness, evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were shot by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie substituted for home team before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come behind after they defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting for the season between the teams, and Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford retired the game when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt retired to Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants had the lead at a break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard equalized once again with a championship goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game late in the second half, and he secured the victory with the team's fives half-way into the final round.
Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Airline leader dies to ensure hundreds of air passengers escape earthquakes
An airliner in Indonesia is hailed as after his death and ensured that a plane that had hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after his colleagues fled for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly swaying control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway right then, could safely ease.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts burst when we heard it,” he added.
The government fears that the death toll can reach thousands, and the country's disaster emergency agency reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The figures are expected to rise further since many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been possible to reach,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Up to six meters high waves have raged Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances getting dead.
There is a lack of clean water.
The mini markets are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross works febrilically to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” CNN said.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini is now reporting that a man is missing after a plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one man is missing. They previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they collaborated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wander through waist depth water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he was suffering a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair a pier also helped in the rescue work using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank about 30 meters below the surface of the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggest 111 people have died in crashes with PNG registered aircraft in the past twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analytics present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors ended the procedure on Saturday in a new trial for a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Attorney General Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile printing to puzzle the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained localization data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which struck what he had claimed earlier.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers's cell phone at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the testimony on Saturday and claimed he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis spoke true when he claimed he was in Sanford's trailer that night, Sanford said he "spoke because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile printing suggests that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Telli deleted calls, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
“He removed her from her life,” said Hale.
The defense will start its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be left to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is community-engaged hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to address social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make community-engaged hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new bloom in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York Children's Caretaker sues couples for resignation after "racist" message
A babysitter in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory resignation after receiving a misdirected message from her mother who complained that she was “another black person.”
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she appeared to the first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEII ENDA A SVART PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a statement.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the loss, it was an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman who resigned Maurice, claiming that their dismissed childcareer, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one day of work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the resignation and demands compensation in the order of $350 per day for the six-month, lodging-based scheme she was promised, though without a contract.
"I wanted to show them that - hello, that's how you just don't," she said to the New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have turned back against the allegations that they are racist and say the resignation of Maurice was the only right thing, since they didn’t feel they could trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
“But would you have handed your children over to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
The comparison of the lawsuit with “extortion” says Plasco was due to his wife having only two months to term and being in a “very difficult situation”.
“Is there such a person you want to punish?
It's not very nice," the stock broker added.
While the legal case goes on, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington's publisher feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said about the letter: “It is difficult to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to know what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a little cloth bear, would have been greatly pleased that his work had been declined.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
“He was a rather quiet man, and he wasn’t a boasting person,” she said.
"But since Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like when you have a child doing a feat: you're proud of it even if it's not really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the honour to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
On landing, her daughter had been rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked so bad that he didn’t think she would survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got the phone from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be back to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medication the doctors had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost her effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body clapped together.
I just had to sit there and wait, in certainty that it happened.
I could not shout and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers — who did not know about the trials she underwent.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I looked down all the time and the tears ran in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcard with mourning women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers follk can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was struck by depression and killed him when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to relive every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him on the smile.
They said his smile could illuminate any room.”
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he killed him.
Sharon says, “I constantly worry that it will be an infectious effect.”
Sharon put the cards “to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even though it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit by yourself, you have to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, his partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling down or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changed mood.
On Christmas Day, he was in the basement - when the kids opened the Christmas gifts, they didn't achieve eye contact or anything."
She says his death was a big trauma for them, but they have to fight through it: “It tears up a large hole in the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to endure and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigation
“I thought that if we could get to something of what he asked for — a time- and scope-limited investigation — we might come to a certain agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee “falled apart” along fixed party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Reluctance was due to timing.
The middle elections are only five weeks away, November 6 - if the Republicans are likely to do bad, it will be significantly more difficult for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called on Senators and conducted lobbying to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI has filed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where at the moment there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "falls" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, which refers to data from South Korea’s collection department, said there had been 1127 defects last year — compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices in human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't commented publicly.
Most North Korean defectors are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China sees the defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South, which is technically still at war, has improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met to talks that were about the locked negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Secretary of State, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no chance that we unilaterally will rust down first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the House of Representatives, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said he had a temper that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't do anything but think that if a woman had acted like this, she would have been called hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening declaration, sometimes he almost shouted and was crying when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He was also strongly condemning the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character killing" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he cannot sit in the Supreme Court as it shows that he is predestined against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's sitting in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the investigation, Kavanaugh questioned whether he would overestimate certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It is a fair harm, months and years in which the mind takes over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s so weird, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said she’s also crying when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she talked to “you might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought it was amazing.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for harm in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office. I started crying with unexplained rage and was caught in the neck collar of an older woman — a cool boss that I had always been a little scared of — who drove me to a staircase.
“Let them never see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry and happy because they managed to catch you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he ran for president.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be cheating on the spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of running as presidential candidate himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was one more.
Some called it “Snow white and the seven dwarfs.”
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she left behind with the funding and swore that she would not run if she didn't get in $2 million.
It was a lost game.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” she wonders.
When she spoke to announce that she did not want to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive in money and to reach voters instead of delegates, as well as anger over sexism - that she fell into crying.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press mentioned her.
“You would think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they wanted to write on my tomb?
“She was crying?”
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The opening ointments of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the struggle is far from over, a rift between the countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by placing customs on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, meaning customs duties of half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, retaliated every time, at the latest with a charge of five to ten percent on US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to match US attacks for attacks, and the world's second largest economy will probably not lift the white flag at first.
Getting Washington to step down means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays their cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give positive figures for China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create relationships that start economic ringing effects in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the spectators have realized before,” said Abigail Grace, a research colleague focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria “ready” for returning refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says they are ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeal for help to resurrect the country, which is raging after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke at the UN National Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country are in recovery.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress of combating terrorism,” he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now facilitated for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that affected their everyday lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country, who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will welcome help to rebuild the ruined country.
But he stressed that it would not be accepted conditional assistance or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn received the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The United States star Phil Mickelson, who broke during much of the tournament, wore his tee strokes in the water at par-316 holes, and had to see himself defeated by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all of his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got their current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 of the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind them, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most winning European of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t let go.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and believed in me.
I am very, very happy to get the cup back.
It’s all about the team and I’m glad I could be helpful,” an emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
He leaves the relay stick to his countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods - I followed that man closely in the upbringing," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career score in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA spent the whole weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk stated after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I am proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We were thrown.
Hats off for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be your team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten.”
