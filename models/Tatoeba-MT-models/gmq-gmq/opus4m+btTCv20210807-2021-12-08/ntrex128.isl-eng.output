People are worried about “looking like a fool.”
Uggur is in some councillors for a proposal to turn their title to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The concerns have arisen because of the plan to change the name of the Council to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of all groups are concerned that it could make them laugh.
One of the ministers of the Labour Party said that his party was concerned because “that's up with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers living outside Wales: in Welsh means twp stupid and pwp means feces.
A member of Plaid Cymru said that the party as a whole was “unhappy” and made other proposals.
A spokesman of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party had a “open mind” about the name change, but pointed out that there was no big difference in the word MWP and Muppet (flon).
In this context, it can be noted that the Wish letter w is carried similarly to u in Icelandic.
The Council, which is now working on a bill to submit the name changes, said: “The closing decision on all the names that are placed over the members of the Council will of course lie with the members themselves.”
The Law of the Government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council published the results of a public opinion survey that showed a great support for calling the Council of Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the ministers, the Council chose WMP (Welsh Parliament members, welcoming MEPs) but the MWP received the greatest support from the public in polls.
According to the news, councillors are now making other proposals, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the President of the Council, Elin Jones, who is to submit a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The proposal for the reform will also include other changes to the functioning of the Council, including rules on the removal of the ministers and the organisation of the committee system.
Members will be able to make a final vote on their title when discussions on the bill begin.
The Macedonian people vote in the country's elections to change their names.
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "The Republic of North Macedonia."
This case was put under a vote in an attempt to resolve decades-long dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens City has long argued that their neighbours’ name in the north equals a claim in its territory and has repeatedly objected to their applications for membership of the EU and Nato.
Macedonia’s President, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the change of the name, has said he will not consider the elections as valid.
On the other hand, supporters of the votes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid to join the EU and Nato.
St. Martin's churches in Harlem are in difficulty
“Older people I’ve spoken to said that before I could find a bar and a church at every corner of the street,” said Mr. Adams.
“Nobody can be found there today.”
He said it was understandable that the bars were falling.
“People have other ways to meet,” he said.
“Children are no longer the centers of the neighborhood where people come together regularly.”
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money recovered from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect to “and sooner or later they will be back to the starting point.”
He added that possible churches would be replaced by residential buildings full of people who will not help to save the remaining refugees in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore will accelerate the closure of these churches forever, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became the center of the black - the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin's Church decades later.
The original white meteorological assembly moved away in the 1930s.
A group of black people who had worked in the neighborhood took over the building.
The congregation of blacks took over St. Martin’s church under the guidance of Pope John Howard Johnson, who had the initiative to abandon shoppers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who wanted to hire black workers or give them a stand-up.
The building was severely damaged by fire in 1939, but members of the church of Father Johnson made plans to rebuild it and also allowed them to construct the clock card.
Pastor David Johnson, son and successor of Pastor Johnson called the clock game proudly "the clocks of the poor people."
The expert who played the clock game in July called it a different name: “cultural fund” and “single historic instruments.”
The specialist, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell game in the world as a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played on, but he moved to a larger bell game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin had no one else in his place.
In recent months, many architects and developers have travelled to St. Martin, some hired by the leaders of the church and others of the diocese.
The Council of the Church, which is supervised by the church leaders, wrote in July, declaring its concerns that the diocese “will seek to bring the cost to” the Council of the Church, even though it had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and developers sent by the diocese.
Some of the bishops complained about the lack of transparency of the bishophood.
Shark wounds a 13-year-old boy who swamped after hum in California
According to the authorities, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him on Saturday when the boy was diving after the hummer in California on the first day of the Hummer fishing season.
The attack took place just before seven o’clock in the morning near Beacon’s Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then rode over along with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had initially thought it was just excited to have reached the humour, but then he was aware that the boy cried, “I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
All his attachment was torn up," Hammel said about what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I cried to everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously injured.
It is not known what kind of shark attacked the boy.
Head of the Coast Guard, Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous kind of shark.
Giles added that the victim had been seriously injured on the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed beach access from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and security purposes.
Giles said there were over 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to take over the UK cosmetic market
Sainsbury’s plan is to defeat Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic shelves in a shopping mall style and with specially-educated assistants.
This is part of the plan to enter the UK’s cosmetic market, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is increasingly growing as the sales of fashion and domestic products decline. The larger cosmetic shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be installed in more stores next year if successful.
Cosmetic investment is part of a big market to use a hill-up lock that was previously utilized by televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury’s claims to double its selection of cosmetics for up to 3,000 types, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get extra space with marked areas similar to those found in shops like Boots.
The store also intends to resale its Boutique cosmetic selection so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly, while younger consumers require it to a greater extent.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will test goods in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
E-commerce and the increased tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food daily in the neighborhood stores means that supermarkets need to make more effort to get people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s CEO, said that the stores would be increasingly similar to shopping centers as the shopping chain tries to fight the low-cost Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos shops in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat shops since both chains were purchased two years ago. According to them, it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The first attempt of the store to live up to their cosmetics and drug departments failed.
Sainsbury’s tested a partnership with Boots around 2000, which ended due to disputes on how to share the income of drug sales in the supermarket.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-account pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyd’s pharmaceutical stores, at £125 million three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will have a role in these programs by adding a wide range of luxury tattoo brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Marketing Director, said: “We have completely changed the look of our cosmetic shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We also have invested in special training for employees who will be at hand for advice.
Our product selection is designed to meet all needs. Stunning environments and convenient locations make us an exciting cosmetic store that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones’s “happiness” after Holly Willoughby cancels a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became “everything” after television scientist Holly Willoughby canceled a £11 million contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their household goods and accessories brand, Truly.
The company had been similar to Goop, a brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has divorced Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, with painful worries by disconcerting a popular lifestyle company in the last minute to focus on new and profitable deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones has been the “earth” of a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the television woman popularly acknowledged that she did not have enough time for the home product and accessories brand Truly because of the new deals worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been similar to Goop, a brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was intended to double Willoughby’s assets, but their estimated value is £11 million.
When Willoughby, aged 37, announced on Instagram that she was going to withdraw from Truly, Jones flew from the UK to stay in one of her many summer homes.
The author said, “Truly was a long-runner on Holly’s priority list.
This would be her future project that would earn her income in the next two decades.
The decision to stop was made by everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line went on the market.
There is a full stock of products at Marlow's headquarters that are ready to go for sale."
Experts believe that the elimination of this morning meeting, which is among the most popular stars in the UK, can cost the company millions due to high product investments, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home products, and possibly causing further delays in the sale of the product line.
This could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a three-child mother, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and Töru Capp, his wife, for decades.
Willoughby co-founded Truly in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined the board of directors in March.
The couple spend their summer vacations together and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin’s company, which produces television material.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S brand, replacing Ant McPartlin as the conductor of ITV shows I'm a Celebrity.
A member of Jones said last night, “We don’t want to say anything about his business.”
"Workful talk, and then we're in love."
He went through the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate to the president, and for being so positive to North Korea’s leaders.
Why has President Trump left so much?
Trump said and imitated the voice of a reporter.
“I haven’t left anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, discussions about the closure of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the main ambassador to North Korea, told UN General Assembly leaders on Saturday that the North had not received an "appropriate response" from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards nuclear decommissioning.
He said that instead, the United States continued to sustain business peasants for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was more positive in his conversation.
“We’re going to meet North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great.”
He said his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim have returned positive results - missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released and earthly remains of American soldiers were returned home.
He also had an unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a stubborn stadium, there were only 200 people standing there,” Trump said.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause great damage to the island, hundreds have died
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, the international aid organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to flee their homes, the emergency situation was not declared, but it is the prerequisite that the international organizations can have assistance there.
“In many cases, they have unfortunately made clear that they are not going to ask for assistance from the international organization, so this is difficult,” said Miss Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization is putting together teams to travel to Palu, it is still not certain when foreign aid workers can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the country's disaster agency, said that Indonesian councillors were evaluating the situation in Palu to see whether the international organization should help with the relief work.
Given the commonness of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly poorly prepared to protect itself from natural forces.
Flood controls have been constructed in Aceh, but they are rarely seen by other shorelines.
It seems that a flood-wave surge in Palu has still increased the number of deaths, even if a warning has been issued.
Even in the best situations, it can be a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make planning even more complicated.
A hospital vessel that has been lying at the port of Lombok to cheer about the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the new accident.
President Joko Widodo made it the main issue of his campaign for elections to improve Indonesia’s downward transport routes, and he has put a lot of money in the roads and railroads.
The shortage of money has plagued Mr. Joko, but the elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to struggle with sustained tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have dedicated themselves to a more conservative religion.
More than 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes when Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with feuds, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturridge, player Liverpool, against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring at the 89th minute of Saturday's game at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a shipment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's team was under 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then attempted a shot to the target towards the spring bar.
The ball flew high above the mark and towards its right corner.
The ball eventually crossed the Kepa Arrizabalaga, which jumped up, and into the network.
“I just wanted to try to get into this position, catching the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as far as possible so I tried to create myself as much time as I could,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and touching once and didn’t think so much about it, but just took the shot.”
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker gave the ball with a helicopter to Mateo Kovacic and then sprinted from the middle to Liverpool play.
Kovacic allowed the ball to move quickly between the center.
Then he sent the ball beautifully forward and sent Hazard in for the virtue.
Hazard ran off defenders and scored in the distance with a left foot ahead of Alisson Becker, goalkeeper Liverpool.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the Premier League finals at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths is rising to 832 after an Indonesian flood.
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and flooding in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to a report from the country’s disaster agency early on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said a number of people had been buried when buildings crashed in the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale. The quake caused floodings that reached up to 6 meters high.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with a brake from buildings that had crashed.
Police arrested 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has begun after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stabbing wound was found at 7:55 this morning near the Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have encouraged people in the area to come forward if they saw or heard something.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is correct, but I would like to ask everyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard something suspicious.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have reached something in the picture with their car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our study."
Police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
Today, people who thought they knew the woman came to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and the police claim to work to inform the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him no one could get into the building or leave it.
He was silent when he discovered what had happened.
The residents have been told that many hours may last until they can go back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She repeated: “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 a.m., two police cars were in the area of the police and one car just outside it.
A number of police officers stood within the marked area and watched the residential buildings.
Anyone who may have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact the Criminal Line anonymously by phone 0800 555 111 and provide the number 247 from 30 September.
The British Parliament of Cromwell is the most recent memorial accused of “rewriting the story”
The banning of the statue would be a poetic justification for the destruction of his magnificent Puritian escorts on so many cultural and religious deities of England.
The Cromwell Company, however, said that Mr. Crick's proposal was "the fitters" and "experience to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion that is going on to remove statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be faced by the battle.
The opposition of the English Civil War to cultural symbols was neither the command nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his father Thomas in the century before.
The impressive statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a sign of the 19th-century men's spirit and is part of a man's story that many believe still deserves praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps rather late in the 19th century than today, has been the protector of the parliament against external pressure, in his case of the kingdom.
There is still a lot of historical controversy as to whether this description is entirely correct.
However, it is certain that the conflicts that were in the middle of the 17th century have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known individual who represents one side of their conflict.
It is worth celebrating and remembering his accomplishments as the protector of the state.”
Pigs attack the Chinese farmer and kill him
Pigs attacked the Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in southwestern China, according to local news.
The man named only with his surname Yuan was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood close to a stand on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, according to South China Morning Post.
Pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into a pig on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He had travelled with his uncle from the neighboring Yunnan region on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and saw that the door to the nearby pork stairs stood open.
He said that inside the stove there had been a large barrel with a bloody mouth.
The trial confirmed that 250 kg of the casualty had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My uncle’s feet were bloody and injured,” said his uncle, with the surname “Wu,” at Guiyang Evening News.
The shooting from a security camera showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked inside so that it did not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence on the scene.
According to the news, Yuan’s family and the market owners have a discussion about compensation for his death.
There are evidence that pigs have attacked people, even though it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a wife and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, 300 kilograms of pigs clamped a Welsh farmer at a tractor until his wife caught the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood taste can raise their aggressiveness.
“They’re just playing.
They want to be curious, they don’t want to hurt anyone.
“You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remnant of the ROSA orchestra brings great rainfall across the southwestern United States
As predicted, the concentration of the orchestra rose diminished as it crosses the cooler seas on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rose will bring great rainfall that could cause floods in northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa became an orchestra in Class 1, with a wind power of 136 km per hour, at 5 a.m. to the eastern time on Sunday, and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rose will go north on Sunday.
At the same time, it will travel eastwards to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives at the Baja California shade on Monday as a tropical storm, therefore, a large tropical storm in the north will follow into the southwestern part of the United States.
Ross will follow up to 25 cm of rainfall in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical rock will be mixed with the lows approaching and forming large and widespread rainfall over the southwest in the next few days.
Local 2.5 to 10 cm of precipitation can cause dangerous acceleration, soil movement and possible shrunks in the desert.
Large tropical storms will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of rainfall per hour in some locations, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected in some places in the southwestern part, especially in most of the state of Arizona.
There is a possibility of rapid flooding with a rapid situation due to the spread of tropical rains.
People are strongly advised against walking into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn the hills into a sloping river, and thunderstorms can cause storms and dust storms.
The downhill approach will carry a local shelter in certain areas on the southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of rainfall that could cause a slight movement on the soil and a mountain on roads.
This is the first rainfall in the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical rainfalls will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before precipitation spreads over larger areas late on Monday and Tuesday.
A great rainfall will spread over four counties on Tuesday and last out on Wednesday.
In October, large temperatures can be expected everywhere in the United States as the Arctic region is cooling, but the tropical climate remains fairly warm.
Sometimes this can cause a lot of heat fluctuations over short distances.
See a very good example of a large temperature difference in the mid-country of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
The next few days will try to rebuild and disperse.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern U.S. will start in October with temperatures around 25 degrees or more from the plains in the south to the northeastern states.
Temperatures could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term forecast suggests that there is a high risk of temperatures above the average for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have been interviewed with Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse that was supposed to have occurred in the 1980s. The testimony was sent out on six different channels.
At the same time, the political patt status continued and television stations paused their regular agenda to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, a senior Arizona senator, submitted a bill to the FBI to investigate the charges for one week.
Ford told the Senate Senate court that she was confident that Kavanaugh had covered her drunk and tried to put her off at a school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was confident that it had not happened.
More people are likely to have watched the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported to have watched on Friday.
The company measured average views on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other television channels that showed the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people's views in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar to the size and for the finals in football or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, most people watched the interviews that took all day on the Fox News Channel or 5.69 million.
The ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million and CNN was 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained great after the trial.
Flake was the center of the game on Friday.
After the office of this Senator of the Republican Party issued a notice that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS took pictures of when protestors attacked him on Friday morning, when he tried to enter a lift to reach a meeting with the Judiciary Committee.
He stayed down for a few minutes while a little raining over him on a live broadcast at CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?”
People said to him, “You have power while so many women stand powerless.”
Flake said his office has issued a statement and before the lift door closed he said he would express himself more at the meeting of the committee.
The cable and television stations were all directly broadcasting later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to forward the nomination of Kavanaugh to the Senate.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the nominated next week, but a minority of Democrats have encouraged it.
Flake was convinced by his friend, Chris Coons, Democrat Senator.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several other Senate senators after that.
Flake's votes were significant because it was obvious that Republicans did not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump authorized the FBI’s investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh.
May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, accuses critics of “being in political play” because of Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Theresa May, the Prime Minister, accused her critics of leaving the European Union of “being in political play” about Britain’s future and engraving the country’s interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend a conference held in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview, which was published next to her interview on the cover of the paper, Boris Johnson, her former Foreign Minister, received the so-called Chequers plan on Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union should charge each other's customs would be "almost discouraged".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the death of LSU player
Police have arrested one suspect due to the death of Wayde Sims in a deadly shooting. He was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for another-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, saying Sims has lost his glasses in the attacks.
Police found the glasses on the ground and said they had found a genetic material from Simpson on them, according to WAFB, sister CBS.
Police say Simpson has confessed in the interrogation to have shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, there was a guarantee of $350,000.
East Baton Rouge County Court Office issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot in the head and down the neck.
Authorities wanted to thank the Louisiana Police Special Force, the Police Crime Laboratory, the Police at the University of Southern University and citizens of the area for the help of the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, the chairman of the sport at LSU, thanked law enforcement officers for “his ruthlessness and searching for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two-metre forward grew up in Baton Rouge where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points on average and took 2.6 runs for each game of the last season.
"Will Wade, basketball coach LSU, said on Friday morning that the team was "harm beaten" and "in shock" due to the death of Wayde.
“That’s something you’re worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano spurs ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention in the United States recommended on Saturday that the Mexicans stay away from the volcano after the activity increased in the crater and recorded 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center observed vibrations and tremors from the volcano.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ashes on car slides in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as in Xochimilco.
Earth physicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 miles southeast of the capital, since the earthquake up to 7.1 on Richter in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists right before the anniversary of an independent referendum
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protestors took over the dissident police and thousands took part in protests in the occasion of the first birthday of the debated elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separationists stoned an irreversible detective with eggs and threw powder paint that formed a dark dust cloud on the streets, which would usually be or else full of tourists.
The battle also broke out later that day, and police used bats to keep fighting in check.
The group of separatists shouted, “We don’t forget and don’t forgive” for a few hours while their opponents shouted, “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen had to be apprehended because of minor injuries they suffered in the protests, according to the local media.
A great tension continues in the independent zone one year after the 1st October referendum was unlawfully judged by the authorities in Madrid, but was welcomed by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of the voters chose independence but participation was poor since most of those who were opposed to separation ignored the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to stop the elections across the area, which resulted in conflict.
The Independence Party had stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent protests in support of the police.
The protest took place, but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, took part in the protests against separationists with his wife, saying he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy over being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but barely victory in the December regional elections, Catalonia's independence groups have had difficulty holding steam this year, as many of the most famous leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention for their role in the organisation of the vote and the Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took the protest to support the police on his phone, said that politicians of both states had encouraged the dispute.
“The excitement is constantly growing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned and asked trial since late last year, that he would invite himself to the European Parliament next year.
“My mission in the European elections is the best way to condemn the recession in the field of democratic values and the oppression we have seen the Spanish government apply,” he said.
Londonderry: People arrested after a car was driven to a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after driving back to Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 a.m.
Bob Blemmings, investigator, said that the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that it was shot from a crossbow towards the vehicle.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga wins Livingston
Livingston, who came from the lower division, got Rangers in an open shield and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as Ibrox's CEO.
Mark Dolly Menga made the success and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard has not yet won the league in this season and plays against Hearts, who are eight points ahead in the top spot, the next Sunday.
For this game, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston is still unsuccessful in the league with six wins, and Holt's main coach has not yet had to experience losses since he came in place of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Loss Opportunities to Bitless Guests
Holt's team should have been over a long time before it scored a goal, but their bone fidelity caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but he hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot by after running through the defense to receive a shell ship from Graig Halkett across the mark.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them in quietness, knowing they could cause guests trouble in the right places.
That was the way the goal was made.
Rangers gained extras and Livingston worked to create target opportunities. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga in unity, which took over the shipment and scored from the middle of the auditorium.
At that stage, Rangers had ruled the ball, but the defense of the locals was unbreakable and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper didn't have to make much effort.
So this continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos was able to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor, the Rangers goalkeeper, and Lithgow shot from the mark after the capture from Livingston.
He was kicked off, and two demands for a penalty - after Halkett's defense against substitute Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were dismissed.
“Great” at Livingston
Alasdair Lamont, reporter BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
For an ordinary man, they stood great and continued to outperform all the expectations of their journey.
Their play style and teammates have hardly changed anything since they came back to the top division, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for having put the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, a leader, was extremely good and led to full-fledged defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes all the time.
Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under the control of Gerrards, they played far under expectations.
They failed to finish their siege and only managed to open the valley half of the locals so this should be a wake-up for the Rangers who are now sitting in the middle of the division.
Erdogan receives blended reception in Cologne
It was a smiled and bright sky on Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s debated visit to Germany with the purpose of improving the relationship between the two Nato nations.
There have been disputes between them due to issues such as human rights, media freedoms and Turkey’s entry into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, giant mosque.
The city is home to most Turkish inhabitants outside of Turkey itself.
Police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters could be found in her neighborhood to see her president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of the Kurds - also heard and condemned both the direction of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The two protestors reflect the level of debate this guest is, but he is honored as a hero of some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator of others.
Deptford: Bicyclist killed in a car crash
A motorcyclist died in a car crash in London.
The conflict took place near the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a multitude of streets in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10.15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and the ambulance officers were injured, but the man died in an accident.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died in a crash where the driver drove off on Childers Street, a mile away from the accident site on Saturday.
The police said she was working to identify the man and let his closest relatives know.
The road has been closed and the drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six people are injured
Six prison guards were injured when disintegration broke out in prison for men, according to a statement from the prison agency.
In Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m., there was an outbreak in Long Lartin prison at the British local time on Sunday.
"Tornado" special officers have been called to the area to try to inhibit the irresistances of eight prisoners, and are solely in one elephant of prison.
The guards were affected by minor injuries in the face of the scene.
A spokesman for the prison agency said: “Educated prison guards have been called out to deal with cases that occur in the Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have been injured.
“No violence has passed in our jails and we make it clear that the officers will be handed over to the police and could expect to spend even more time behind the lock and beat.”
Over 500 prisoners are in the Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison officer had to go to a hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
In October of last year, a police officer was called to the place to deal with serious disruption of peace, where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Ross threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with fast flooding (drying area could benefit)
It is rare that tropical landslides pass over Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early next week when the remnants of the orchestra of Rossus cross the southwestern part, at risk of a sudden flood.
The country’s weather agency has already issued warnings about hurricanes before Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rose will head over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with rainfall.
The Phoenix Meteorological Office said on Twitter that only "thy lizards have been able to maintain strength to be classified as tropical storms or lows at less than 320 km away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of Arizona border.
The last predictions from the country's piercing center predict 5-10 cm of rainfall, with a stagnant rainfall of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Precipitation is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas of the southwest, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin (The Great Basin), with the possibility of a unique rainfall of up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of exploding, the rainfall from Ross could be a blessing because there are large droughts in the area.
Although flooding can cause severe damage, some of this rainfall will have a positive effect, as the drought is now in the southwestern part.
According to the U.S. Drying Authority, at least 40 percent of Arizona is extremely dry, which is the second-highest party,” the news reported from weather.com.
First, Ross will land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a storm on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at a 19 km speed per hour.
The storm crosses the cooler sea in the Pacific Ocean, and its power diminishes.
He is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday or Monday night.
There is a potential for heavy rainfall in some areas of Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
“The precipitation is expected to reach 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwest of Sonora, with a potential of up to 25 cm of precipitation,” a report told Weather.com.
Rose will then head north over Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical landscape. She will then continue up through Arizona and arrive to the south of Utah late on Tuesday night.
“The main threat that is expected to originate from Rose or her remains is a very high rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and in the southwestern desert area of the United States,” the country said.
This precipitation is expected to cause life-threatening hurricanes and movement on the soil in the deserts, and crawling in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for murder attempts, after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The game was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. to British local time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition was said to be “stable.”
One 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
The police have been waiting for a witness that could have a phone recording of what happened to give up.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "feel the evil and the anger" from the Democratic Party
"A vote to support the Kavanaugh judge is a vote that rejects the relentless and abusive methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "gett to feel the evil and the anger" from the Democratic Party out of his entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Senate on Thursday, hardening Christine Blasey Ford's charges that he had sexually harassed her a few decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified to the committee for his accusations.
The president said on Saturday, “Americans had seen the genius and the diversity and courage.”
“A vote to confirm the Kavanaugh judge is a vote that confirms one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an impressive CV as an official employee,” he said to the group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of the Republican supporters taking part in the mid-term elections.
“There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
“I don’t do it, but I’m really doing it,” he said.
"That's why I'm going around a wide range to fight for great candidates."
Trump claimed that Democrats were working on “toughting and obstructing.”
The first key vote on the floor of the Senate for Kavanaugh’s nomination is to take place no later than Friday, according to an assistant leader of the Republicans in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died after an earthquake and a flood in Indonesia, and likely the number of deaths will rise
At least 384 people were killed, and many were scattered out by a huge wave of beaches, when a great earthquake and flooding was riding over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered together at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six-metre-high waves headed on the beach by the sunset, scooped a number of people on the sea out and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The flooding wave was formed after an earthquake of 7.5 points on Richter.
“When the flooding threat was formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so it died,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, at an information meeting in Jakarta.
“The flood wave didn’t come alone, she brought cars, tree drums, houses, she hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the flood wave had traveled over the open sea at 800 kilometres of speed before it hit the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the flood and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs from the air published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and unused bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The aftermath continued to ride over the beach on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was observed in areas with 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia’s agency for food and technology use said that the energy released from the countryside in the big earthquake on Friday would have been about 200 times higher than from the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which lies at the end of the long and narrow bay, could have increased the size of the flooding wave, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was “real” and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had crashed.
The body of a few victims was found trapped under a bracket from crashed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and damage to property could be greater along the coastline 300 km north from Palu in an area called Donggala, which is close to the source of the earthquake.
“Communicate completely down and no information received” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“Over 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the relevant areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not being told that a flood wave had crashed at Palu, though officials said the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media, one could hear one cry from the upper floor of a building to warn the people on the street below that the flood wave was approaching.
A few minutes later, the flooding wave hit the beach, carrying away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn’t confirm the video.
The earthquake and flooding caused an electric insecurity that prevented communications with Palu and made it difficult for authorities to organize relief work.
The military has begun sending aircraft with aids from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but people who have been helped by the region still need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for assistance and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit Palu refugee centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800 after an Indonesian flood.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of the World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where it seeks shelter in the tent cities that were set up in the garden outside their offices. Gereylegging blasted them on the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
“People said they saw a lot of houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Auxiliary teams have started hard relief work, but some have complained that foreign auxiliary staff with a high expertise would be hampered from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, stocks and staff can only begin to occur if the accident area is declared a disaster zone.
It hasn't been done yet.
“This is still a local accident zone,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster zone, we can open up for foreign assistance, but no statement has yet occurred."
When the second night fell over Palu after the earthquake and flooding wave on Friday, their still missing friends and families kept hoping that their loved ones would be one of the miracle stories that shed hopeful deceit on the devastating headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the start.
On Sunday, relief workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian Air Force, had been the coach of two pilots, now missing, for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who stayed inside the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a man with a long experience in flying, I have my own emotional burden to carry,” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hours after news arrived within the swivel group because the Roa Roa hotel had crashed, he would have sent WhatsApp a message desperately to the competitors who stayed in Palu and attended the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a grey signal, instead of blue.
“I think it means that the message was not received,” he said.
Thieves steal 26,750 dollars in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed 26,750 dollars from an employee of Brink, who was filling up a bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a report from the police in Newport.
The driver of the car had been draining the ATM in the entertainment area and was filling more money on it, said Dennis McCarthy, a police officer, in the announcement.
When he was at his job, another man came “running behind Brink the employee” and stole a money bag that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspected fleeing the scene, according to the announcement, but the police did not give up how many were controversial.
Those who may have information about the suspects are asked to contact the police in Newport on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rappare Changes His Name in Ye
Kanye West will change his name in Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The creature previously known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album that was released in June.
The change comes before his participation in the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi in the show, but she resigned for “emotional reasons,” said the show’s producer.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but there is also a shortening of his current name.
“I think ‘ye’ (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year when he spoke the name of his album to radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“I am you, I am you, I am you.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and over to just Ye - to be just a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, everything.
It’s a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former collaborator of West, has also written his name with and without strings and letters.
President of Mexico is called not to use the military against public citizens.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, has vowed to never use military power against public citizens, now the country will soon recall the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students.
On Saturday on Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers fired a peaceful protest on the square on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people in a time when the students' leftist movements were shooting roots throughout the Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to assist young people in Mexico by giving all students a monthly grant and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of learning opportunities attracted young people to crime gangs.
The United States should double the capital for artificial intelligence
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the resources it holds in research in the field, says inventor and artificial intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were reported after the various departments of the U.S. government issued notifications of artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal overall program of artificial intelligence.
China, however, announced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in innovation with artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the funding that goes into artificial intelligence research, considering that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
"Double capital could double the chances that the next major discovery in artificial intelligence will be made in the United States," Lee told CNBC.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” which was released this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the main artificial intelligence companies in China.
He worked with artificial intelligence systems in the 1990s at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best player in the United States in Othello, and later was the director of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Division at Google.
Lee talked about previous technical competitions, held by the US authorities, such as the Defence Division Robotic Competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to spot the next entrepreneurs.
Scientists in the U.S. often have to do a lot to get the power from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that loves its main ideas, but the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired talents from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. to strengthen its artificial intelligence research.
“I think those who have a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence should get a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China's parliament released its future identities plan in July 2017.
China’s Natural Science Institute provides funds to people working at university institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar government agencies do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a artificial intelligence center, designed to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, it invests over 100 million dollars annually in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation, designed to create a security council on artificial intelligence, has nothing to pass on for months.
Macedonian voters vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The inhabitants of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country to "The Republic of North Macedonia" in an attempt to resolve decades of disputes with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and Nato.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that its name in the north equals a claim to their territory and therefore denied them entry into Nato and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will undermine the identity of the majority of Macedonian inhabitants of Slavic origin.
President Ivanov said he will not participate in the vote and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum required to make the vote valid.
The question of the electoral bill is: “Do you want to join Nato and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say this is a fair fee for Macedonia to join alliances like the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people in Macedonia so that it can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, at Skopje.
Although the result is not legally binding, enough Senators have said they will comply with it and bind it into law.
The name change would require the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The election committee said nothing unusual had been reported at 1 o'clock at noon.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum on whether to change the name of the country, but it would pay its way into Nato and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, worked to prepare a small range and set up chairs in front of tents that had been built by those who will ignore the vote.
“We are humble to Nato and the EU, but we want to become members with head high, not go through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn around like China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said Nato will bring the necessary resources to Macedonia, where the percentage of unemployed is over 20 percent.
“I believe that the longest majority will agree that more than 80 percent of the people in the country are favored by the EU and Nato,” Zaev said.
He said that consent would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A survey published on Monday from the Macedonian policy research institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, but it is lower than the minimum required.
Another survey from Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
70% said they would say yes.
So that the referendum is considered valid, the metting must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious shock for the government’s policy, which is in favour of the Western countries, since it took over in May of last year.
Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all defense Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to defensive Brighton in Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine leader received a shipment in the middle of the field at the beginning of the siege.
He jumped past three defenders of Brighton and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-dressed defenders.
He escaped one defender and then ran a few more straight to Brighton's defensive career.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English predecessor used the first touch within the cast to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to play on Mathew Ryan, a goalkeeper Brighton, with a shot in the right side of the goal.
“Aguero has some leg problems,” said Pep Guardiola, Director-General City, to reporters.
“We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky that he scored at this moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the league.
That mark came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a shipment far inside Brighton's whale.
He sent an impressive long ball to the left of Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent to Sterling towards the spring bar.
Framherji City sent the ball to the net just before he ran out of it.
City plays at Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Since the Nationals team has been excluded from playing in the finals, there was no reason to force another start.
But the enthusiastic Scherzer hopes to get to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have the chance to get to the finals, but they have a one-play advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the western league.
Rockies received at least a “wildcard” seat with their 5-2 victory at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still strives to reach its first league title.
“While we play for free, we can at least play for the electric atmosphere in Denver, as well as the other team will definitely play their best game this year.
“Why shouldn’t I want to compete in such a situation?”
Nationals will still report who will be the first pitcher to play on Sunday, but it is believed that they will let Scherzer throw in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting a game for the 34th time, took a training session on Thursday and would throw on a Sunday that is usually a Sabbath with him.
This right-wing pitcher in Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 winds in 220 2/3 cycles during this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the case around Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, when he spoke of the importance of the Republican supporters taking part in the mid-term elections.
“Everything is at stake in November.
It is five weeks in one of the most important elections of our lives.
“These are one of the big, big... I don’t bid myself forward, but I do, but that’s why I’m going through a wide range to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, radical group of democrats, you can see that happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see cruelty, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to go to gain control and control, they just want power and control, we don’t give them it.
He said that the Democrats were working on “toughing and obstructing.”
“And it has been seen in the last four days,” he said, saying, “the Democrats are angry and evil and cruel and untrue.”
He named the Senate Senator Dianne Feinstein, a leading Democrat in the Senate Senate’s Judgment Committee, by name, and was responded with a loud buli from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who did the document?
Oh, what?
No, no. I waited for one... it was really bad body weight, the worst I've ever seen."
The church is no longer a church.
He doesn’t like those who express their minds.
When the activist Momentum in my party decided to retaliate, it hardly surprised me.
I am, after all, the last of many Members of the Labour Party who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our minds.
Joan ryan, my congressman received a similar treatment because she strongly objected to prejudice against the Jews.
In my case, the proposal for accused me came about because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having a responsible economic policy, on national security, across Europe, ironically similar issues and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East meeting announces on Friday that “we want the meetings to understand no exceptions and be successful.”
In my eight-year career as a member of the Labour Party, Friday sessions have been quite that.
Unfortunately, it’s not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of “milder and better” politics has been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that different opinions are not passed in the Workers’ Party and that all opinions are judged according to whether the leaders of the party consider them acceptable.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, who I thought before had similar political opinions to me, began to expect that I took a complete reversal and supported opinions that I had never agreed before, whether it was about national security or a common EU market area.
Every time I speak publicly - and then it doesn't matter what I say - it follows the crawling abominations on social media, calling for my elimination, middle politics denied and I said that I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
This is not just my experience.
I know I’m happier than some of my colleagues, where most of the comments I get to me are usually political.
I admire professionalism and confirmation of those who have to endure the holocaust of sexual or prejudiced offenses daily but never retreat.
One of the biggest disappointments in this political period is how attacks and offenses become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Workers’ Party should support a tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer tolerant to the church and with every distrust proposal or change in electoral rules, the party will become increasingly narrow.
I’ve had a lot of advice for the last two years about not having too high, and then I’d be “all right.”
But I did not decide to participate in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Workers’ Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the government Thatcher who left my schoolroom in disrepair, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in the city council or in parliament.
I have never given up my political views, nor at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policies and where I disagree with current leaders.
For those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that when the country is on its way to Brexit, which will harm homes, businesses and our public service, I don’t understand the desire to spend time and energy in my devotion to the Leaders of the Workers’ Party.
But my only message that I want to send from me is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my constituency, whether they are members of the Workers’ Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threats of divergence or political exclusion will hinder me from doing what I consider to be for the best benefit of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touch limits may have made a point in the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the win separated in this short play of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now in the top spot on the list and the only team out of ten that is still unbeaten.
Finally, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made locals more victorious and Peter Murchie coach had the full right to be happy.
“We’ve had hard opposition in our games so far and are still unbeaten, so I’ve got to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Ayr deserved praise, they took advantage of their chances better than we did.”
Mark Grant Anderson came to Ayr on the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned the attack, but a yellow card on the Scottish captain, which was allowed to play the game with Warriors, allowed Melrose to let the numbers talk and Jason Baggot managed to score a touchpoint.
Climo increased the lead of Ayr with a hell before he scored with a kick right before half time, and then a touchpoint came over 17-5 in half.
But Melrose began the second half with force and touchpoint Patrick Anderson, after Baggot reversed the attack, reduced the goal difference to five points.
He then had a long break to sustain serious injuries at Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off from playground, and after that Ayr still increased his lead with a touchpoint from Stafford McDowall, after Climo reversed the siege.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, then received the yellow panel, and Melrose re-appeared to be a man over with a touchpoint from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a harsh attack.
However, locals came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow panel for capturing Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchpoint behind the Ayr siege, after the extra spin.
Climo turned the sack back, as he did again immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe reached the kick of David Amrstrong from the auditorium and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the fifth touchpoint of the team.
Stars Still Game shows ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game, seems ready to move to a restaurant clash after discovering that he was hired as the manager of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC series popular, which he writes and plays in with his old partner from the entertainment industry, Creg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the prospective ninth season will be the last and apparently Kiernan has plans for Craiglang's life.
According to public records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor wanted nothing to say about the story, but a Scottish Sun author suggested that Kiernan wanted to become a participant in the “living restaurant shop” of Glasgow City.
“The sea is ours: the coastless country of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean.”
Marines guard the headquarters of the fleet in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flag.
Naval stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are marked by the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It’s our duty to recover it.”
In the midst of all the landscaped Bolivia remembrance of the coastline, which was lost to Chile in bloody conflicts in the 19th century, still in fresh memory - along with the desire to navigate the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the strongest in decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on 1 October after five years of prosecution.
“Bolivia possesses the power, the unity spirit and the innocence, and, of course, awaits the decision with a positive mind,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diploma.
Many residents of Bolivia will monitor the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice in The Hague will settle Bolivia in favour of their claim that Chile is obliged to grant Bolivia access to the sea, after many decades of difficult talks.
The decision on Monday is also extremely important for Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indians who will have a disputed fight for the re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts think it unlikely that the court ruled Bolivia in favor, and that it would little change if he did.
The Court of Justice, headquartered in the Netherlands, has no power to give land from Chile and has ruled that the decision will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the court’s ruling comes only six months after listening to the final talks indicates that the case “had not been complicated,” said Paz Sárate, a Chilean international expert.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been the case for Bolivia to progress, but have caused the country to return.
“The Bolivian government has stolen the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
Morales's speech has deduced all the goodness of Sile, she said.
Bolivia and Sile will continue to talk sometime, but it will be very difficult after that.
The two countries have not been divided by messengers since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the former President of Bolivia and the representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile” and the opportunity to “bind an end to a dispute that reaches 139 years back in time, both countries for good,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue as a political heap.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is a chance to see that we need to recover from the past.”
North Korea says nothing will be of nuclear disarmament unless it can rely on the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the country will never take down its nuclear weapons if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri held his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Foreign Minister, appears to be re-opening negotiations on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s leader.
Ri says it’s “draumors” to think that the U.S.’s continued business prayers and protests against the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever kneel North Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the statement unless Pyongyang first takes clear action to take down its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump will meet again at another meeting.
However, many doubts state that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country most likely considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion exhibitions in Paris present the latest line of big headwear that will come in fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, you don’t have to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a number of superficial oversized hats for their SS19 line in the fashion scene that fascinated the jetty of the fashion week in Paris.
Numerous images of extremely unobtrusive hats have been published on Instagram this summer, and these designers have had their innovative creations for the display of fashion shows.
The main work of Valentino was a large light brown hat with wide shoulders that resembled the feathers and covered the heads of the models.
Of other oversized accessories, watermelons could be seen placed precious stones, beechshade and even pineapple, but these things are not designed to keep the heat on the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, precisely at the right time for a hawkwatch.
Many of the colorful masks were fitted with aggregated lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One mask resembles a diving device with a respiratory pipe and glasses, while others resemble melting ice in a bread form.
If you want to go to the fashion, the luck is with you.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon come on sale in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats come on the heels of La Bomba, a strap hat with over 60cm of large shoulders that have adorned the head from Ridesign to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion brand behind the extremely inappropriate hat that was seen on all social media was the inspiration for other large accessories that appeared on the fashion scene - a straw-coast bag that was almost as large as the swim-fashioned model that wore it.
The orange strap, with a straw and a white handle made of leather, was the main part of the La Riviera SS10 fataline Jacquemus at the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, the styler of the famous people, said in an interview with FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags appear in the fashion stores for the next summer - since the designer has caused such a great impact should be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for world citizens
Scotland’s private schools are known for their students’ outstanding performance and have continued in 2018 with new, impressive test results, which are still strengthened by individual and group performance in sports, arts, music and other social media.
These schools have up to 30,000 students across Scotland, with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (Scottish Private School Council, SCIS) in defense of them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further graduation, the career they have chosen and their position as a world citizen.
As a teaching sector that can assemble and educate specially designed curriculums, we see that innovations continue to be a popular learning topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it touches his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we can not only trust in English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show us that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest proportions of students who achieve exams in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned a foreign language received the Excellence A.
The data collected from 74 schools within SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the Excellence A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received the rating A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages that the necessary fitness that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as an election, are placed in the same place as scientific related topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private school and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for the reasons employers stated it was difficult to hire jobs, 17 percent was because the lack of people with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future jobs.
Now that more and more jobs require skills in languages, this skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career people choose, it will have a real advantage in the future if they learn another language, but it is a skill that lasts forever.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person the advantage of competitors.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to maintain conversations, and French was the only language spoken by two-digit percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest immediately in language learning.
Multilinguals, especially in new markets, will give children a better chance to find a significant job.
In Scotland, different between schools is what language they teach.
A certain number of schools will focus on classical innovations, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when watching until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It is not possible to deny that at this time, in a global business environment, language remains necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, a modern language should really be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer choices, diversity and superiority for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Scottish Private School Council.
LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
It will soon end up for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of Lakers, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
“It will be longer than one minute and shorter than 48,” Walton said on Lakers official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game program of Lakers before the start of the season.
“In this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare myself,” he said.
Timetables for Trump's West Virginia Election Meeting and YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of elections, and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop in friendly places, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election to a new Supreme Court judge has been suspended, Trumpad aims to build up support for the next mid-term elections, because Republicans are at risk of losing control of the parliament when voting will be paid in November.
What time is the Trump election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin at 7:00 a.m. to the east coast time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below through direct broadcasting on YouTube.
Trump is likely to convince the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, in which excitement ruled due to the accusations of sexual harassment. The Senate vote to confirm him as a judge was suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates the accusations.
But Trump’s main goal is to help Republicans get better, but they are waiting for a difficult election in November.
Therefore, the message from Trump’s campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, aim to “fill volunteers and supporters of enthusiasm as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the Senate,” according to Reuters.
“President management is so necessary for the president’s plan that he will travel to as many counties as possible already,” said Trump’s spokesperson for the Reuters news agency.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling and supporters are expected to come from "Ohio and Pennsylvaniu and that Pittsburgh media tells him," the West Virginia Metro News news agency said.
On Saturday, Trump’s second visit to West Virginia will be this month, but he won over 40 percent in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to help Patrick Morrissey, a candidate of the Republicans in West Virginia to the Senate, but he is down on a poll.
“It’s not a good idea for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows a fight to keep hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three single-sided circles, the four-player, which was afternoon on Saturday, could be exactly what needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
The fluctuations in success are a sports concept that has been invented and which players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like this.
Where would they say the success is now?
“They had a six-step advantage and now it’s four points, so the success lies rather on our side now, I guess,” said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four stages ahead with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, consider themselves to have a bit of wind in the sails, and they can be hopeful of many, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played greatly all the way to the surface and leads with his example.
The feat rose as he walked on the ring and he put down an important puddle to hold all four levels of the game after he and Thomas had been two levels below after two games.
His assault, which assured them the victory in the game on the 15th hole, received a similar shout of jubilees, crying out of the genre that tells a man that he believes the American team still has a victory hope.
“You just have to dive deep and think about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s the only thing these players can do now.
18 holes to win points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but thrilling European couple has won four games of four and can't do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only pair that got a shovel on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid shoveling on Saturday morning, afternoon on Friday and on the nine holes of the field on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audience clearly shows that they are the pair that needs to win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun is seated across the Le Golf National Stadium.
The best option would be that both did it at the same time on different holes.
It’s too early to talk about the European team’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson joined Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourth game in the morning, playing with Alex Noren.
Two doubles in the first nine holes, the Spanish and the Swedes dug into a hole that they never managed to scratch out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the four games are so exciting to watch in close proximity because of the communications between the pairs, their advice, the advice they don’t give and how a game schedule can change in one stage.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a considerable advantage for the final day, but these four-game slots also showed that the team of the Americans has the battle will that some had doubted it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 leads for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage for the Ryder Cup's final day after a four-ball and a four-ball on Saturday, with an advantage of 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who were struggling, and have scored four points at Le Golf National.
The European team Thomas Bjorns, who would like to regain the winning cup, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed a great superior over the U.S. team in the four-ball game of the morning and won 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the four games and won two games but failed to win up the score difference.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after the magnificent weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they showed a lot of team strength and defeated Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who drew himself through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliant talent, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and four-plays, including seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who was defeated for the four-ball game this morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the fours and won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are in the first and third place on the list of the world's best golfers.
Europe, however, did not go all in profit on this mild and steep day of the southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners in golf, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won with difficulties 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four ball games and later returned and won Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the four games after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that the team has won up four points will at the start of a single race, although the team Furyks only needed a draw to keep the cup going.
After two days, however, they seem to be attacked on Sunday.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament “impossible” without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday that the continuing trade-beans only shouted on their distrust to the United States and it would be impossible for the country to disrupt its nuclear weapons alone under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said during the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “meaning action to show goodwill” in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile testing, taking down the nuclear testing area, and promising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not seen any similar reactions from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances, it is impossible to take down our nuclear weapons alone first.”
Although Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stage-shaped" approach to nuclear disarmament where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed special to the extent that he did not deny unilateral nuclear disarmament purely as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump’s joint statement at the first meeting between the U.S. President and North Korean leaders, in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim vowed to work on the “nuclear disarmament of Korean history” and Trump issued a promise to secure North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought a solution to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax the strict trade ban against North Korea.
“The U.S. demands that nuclear weapons take place first,” said Ri.
“There are only dreamers who don’t know about us to think that business prayers can put us on the knees.
But the problem is that our continued business prayers increase our distrust.”
There was no mention of plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about earlier this week.
In return, the minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea for the past five months, adding: “If the party to this nuclear arms issue was South Korea in place of the United States, this would not be the patt position in the case of nuclear weapons in the Korean Sea.”
In spite of this, the tone of Ri's speech was extremely different from his speech last year when he said at the General Assembly that it would be inevitable to target missiles from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after "the devilful president" Trump called Kim a "fireman" in suicide.
Last year, Trump threatened to “destroy” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim of the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that a great deal of work was still being done and that business prayers would have to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame as to what it was like: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
But Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s commercial prayers must continue until nuclear nuclear weapons have taken place and it has been confirmed.”
The Security Council agreed to increase business prayers with North Korea from 2006 in an effort to block funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for doing “crimeful claims.”
North Korea pledged on a meeting with Moon this month to take down a missile zone and nuclear station if the United States took “responsive action.”
He said Kim had said that the “responsive actions” he sought were security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and actions towards normal relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a class on a rest.
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an effort to track against the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little about the basics of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleeping Medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and the Women's Hospital, designed the course and believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea of doing the course after holding a lecture on the impact that sleep deficiencies have on learning ability.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I told this now, in my final year?’
She said no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he said to the Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits help learning ability and performance in sports and even contribute to general wellness.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and Director of Health Services, said that the University had decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were very sleepless over the week.
The course is an hour long and involves various interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of the living room, where students click on coffee cups, window tents, sports shoes and books to learn about the impact of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen in lack of sleep, along with the importance of a good routine before sleep.
In the second part, participants are told how a lack of sleep for the long term can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students.
But we feel that they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Czeisler added.
The culture that accommodates those who are awake and learning all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deficiency was an increasing problem.
Ensuring to achieve enough sleep of good quality should be a “defense weapon” of students to protect against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid fatigue, because sleep deficiency increases the brain’s urgency for food so that the body is continually.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old professor of chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, but he sat one of the professor's courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all the master students to complete a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider adjusting the alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to awaken them, and keep in mind the harmful effects from blue light that electronic screens and LED lights emit, but it can confuse the inner clock of the body and lead to trouble falling to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
Rangers was still struggling with a split-up team Stevens Gerrards had to accept 1-0 losses at Livingston, after a goal by Dolly Menga.
Ibrox wanted to achieve his first victory in the league after his victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt team gave Gerrards only his second loss in his 18 games as manager. The team is now eight stages behind Hearts, which is in the top place in the Ladbrokes Premiership division.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and Rangers seemed to lack all the inspiration and was never likely to match.
Rangers now falls to sixth place, while Livingston goes up to the third and is only behind Hibernian in a goal difference.
Rangers may face further trouble after Calum Spence, a lineman, had to get intimidated due to head injury after some item was thrown into him from the whale-half of his guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and finished in the premiere in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, stayed with the same Livi 11 setup that reached the stage of Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how well-trained his teams chose over the opponent.
Rangers may have had more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball that it reached.
They should have scored only two minutes after the start of the game when the first broadcast from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of the Allans McGregors goal, but he shot a pass.
A long extra spin from Keaghan Jacobs then ended at Craig Halkett, while Alan Lithgow, his defensive partner, shot past the spring bar.
The Rangers regained control of the game, but appeared to live rather in hope than belief in their game in the final stage of the game.
Alfredo Morales felt he should have received a penalty when a quarter of the game ended, when he and Steven Lawless were coinciding, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the call from the Colombian man.
Rangers only managed to score two shots in the first half, but Liam Kelly, former goalkeeper Ibrox, did not have much to protect the shell from Lassana Coulibaly and easy shots from Ovie Ejaria.
Although in the 34th minute a chance from Livi had come despite the other team being overtaken, no one can deny that they deserved it, but only because of their perseverance.
Rangers failed to do anything from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield failed when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his calm and chose to send to Menga who then easily scored.
Gerrard took control in half and sent Ryan Kent into place of Coulibaly and the exchanges affected almost immediately when the back guard entered Morelos, but Kelly quickly replied and ran forward to close the shot.
Livingston continued to trick the guests into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy playing and Lithgow and Halkett got each long shipment on one’s feet.
Holt's team could have increased its leadership in the final minutes, but McGregor was well in refusing Jacobs for an opportunity before Lithgow ran to the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a substitute for Rangers, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell down, but Thomson redirected it.
Almanak: The Man Who Invented the Geiger Counter
This is the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to study and measure radioactivity and that invention eventually led to a device called Geiger meter.
Geiger has gained a permanent position in the scientific world since then, but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unprecedented roles as scientists:
“What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger measuring, used to find radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on you, you can hear the effects from the atoms due to radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: “It really works right now!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that carries his name continues.
New Cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to “see” dangerous cells
New Cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
Treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory
Then they can “se” proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and are then injected back into the patient.
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman receiving the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to recognize dangerous cancer cells.
The procedure involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory so that they can “se” proteins called HER2 and are found in many types of cancer. Then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that the vaccine is extremely effective.”
HER2 “lets various types of cancer stop growing,” including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon and rectum,” said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method in which immune cells are taken from patients and the “instructed” to attack cancer cells has acted on the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West had a long conversation in support of Trump and had a MAGA hat after appearing on the TV show SNL.
It didn't end well
Baulad was on Kanye West in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a long-term speech in which he commended President Donald Trump and said he would bid for President by 2020.
After moving the third song of the night, Ghost Town, where he wore Make America Great derhatsu, he long spoke against democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so often to white people who say, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’”
If I were concerned about racial hatred, I would have moved from the United States a long time,” he said.
SNL started the show with the Hollywood star Matt Damon joked about Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate’s Judgment Committee for Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual accusation.
Although West's long-running was not released, her recording was put on social media by Chris Rock.
I don’t know if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the recording.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received bad receptions due to his hat choice.
“I was put in a mock back.
They said to me, “Don’t go up to the stage with this hat.”
They put me in mocking!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the deep hole?” and said that he would put on his superhero box “for that means you can’t arrange for me. Do you want the world to progress?
Try the love.”
His comments were met with bauli from the audience at least twice, and SNL's actors seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, and one in attendance said to the newspaper, "There was a stone silence in the studio."
West had been invited to join the show instead of singer Ariana Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many of his performances as he sang the song I Love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, the chairman of the Conservative Party TPUSA, who said on Twitter: “To one of the most courageous souls: THANK YOU TO SEE THE MOT.”
Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply “he himself and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I did not choose to reward anyone (by purchasing his music or clothes or supporting his ‘list’) that I think is supporting and spreading the ideology that is damaging to my community.
He is free.
“We are, too,” he added.
For the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that now he was "the creature previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and walk in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the music legend Prince named, which changed his name to a symbol and later named himself the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of assassination after a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with a murder attempt after being stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to attend a courtroom in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will go over the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticizes poisonous masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent HBO adventures.
The actor, 31 years old, has, however, criticized the stereotype of the male hero and said that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be harsh to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that “something has gone wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem that poisonous males are in the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married her co-star of the Crown Games, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong opinions” on how to deal with this issue.
“I feel at the moment - what’s gone wrong with manhood?”
“What have we taught men in their growth, about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic male manliness due to a very male person on television.
He said, “What is withborn and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that make young boys feel like they must be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the most important questions of the time - how do we change this?
“It is clear that something has gone wrong with young men.”
He also acknowledged in the interview that he would not play in any other Crown Championships after the season resembles the next summer and said that he had received "nothing of battlefields and horses."
As of November, Kit will play in the re-creation of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about having played in the Crown Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife in these episodes, so they gave me somehow my future family and my life after that,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend who Kit played in these Emmy Awards series.
The couple married in June 2018, on the country family of Lesliar in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with the HIV virus or with AIDS.
Health authorities say more than 820.000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new infections occurred with sex, which is a change from what was before.
Previously, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the administration of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus in this way has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese health workers said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus or AIDS has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection caused by sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but much discrimination against LGBT people is still taking place.
Because of the conservative values in the country, research has estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections are caused by inadequate contraceptives in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from Republican Senators, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy teachings”
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, Senator of the Republican Party, denied the allegations that one of her employees had published the personal information of three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said these statements came from “over-right” extremists and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more miserable lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The information published included addresses and U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham's telephone numbers from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday from an unknown party at Capitol Hill during the interrogation of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge, for sexual accusation.
The leak came after the three Senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said the IP addresses identifying the source of the information were linked to the Waters office and published information about one of her employees, according to Capitol Hill.
“This irrational accusation is completely wrong and pure lie,” Waters continued.
"My employee - what personal data and security are now at risk for these wrong accusations - was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unfaithful accusation is completely wrong and pure lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized online, including Ara Fleischer, former White House news officer.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It’s a sign that she doesn’t have the ability to sit in the Senate.
When someone is accused without reason, do not react with anger.
No opposition can be shown.
You can’t ask about the reasons for the accused.
It has to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats on the Kavanaugh judge, who critics said had appeared to be too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate against Waters during the mid-season elections, also said his opinion on Twitter.
“Well, if it is true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had told "appropriate authorities and law enforcement officers of these untrue statements.
“We will ensure that the guilty will be found,” she continued, “and that they will be charged with all the actions that are damaging and dangerous to all my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes again - a spy scene with Rowan Atkinson
It has become a habit of the novel looking for Brexit references in all new films where Britain comes about history, and it seems to apply in this revival of the Johnny English comedy series - which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and rightly awakened back to life in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a question of how bad we are for the country?
Whether or not, Johnny English has been renewed for the second time to scratch everything - his name shows above all that he is a creation designed for exhibitions in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, a wise intelligence officer who pretends to have stunning characters, but is a little blend of Clouseau, a dass of Mr. Bean and a little deleted by the man who played one note for the song Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic Games.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the mysterious world city that Atkinsons once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he separated everything from himself in a mess.
There is one or two good things in this new Johnny English film.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking a helicopter dressed in a middle-aged bride and the helicopter blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his comic skills, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially already “serious” films like James Bond and Mission Impossible films also offer undoubtedly a joke.
The grain seems rather intended for children than adults and I thought the adventures that Johnny English encountered were not as imaginative and focused as the silent jokes of Atkinsons in artificial Mr. Beans.
The main reason for this film is that Britain is in trouble.
A computer hacker has been able to break into Britain’s secret spy network and come up with the identity of all British spyers, to a great deal of trouble for the spy on duty — but there Kevin Eldon is unfortunately in too little role.
This is the last step for the Prime Minister who is a proud and controversial person and already in a great hurry due to enormous political impotentness: Emma Thompson does his best with his role as a character to remind Theresu May, but the script is not a lot of fish for her.
Her advisers tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had been settled in the holy stone.
And there Johnny English himself comes to history, now a schoolmaster at some fine school, but also provides secret instruction in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers a spy school that reminds us of the School of Rock film.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and meets Bough, his former long-trött partner, whom Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine captain, but in the vital role, Vicki Pepperdine does not quite let her light shine.
The spy nephew who clutters everything in her Majesty's service has now returned to the gear and meets Opheliu Bulletova, who is played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is thrilled by the magic of the fascinating billionaire in the technology sector, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: that is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their acceleration: they set on a fine French restaurant, ready to serve, they cause vultures as they smuggle themselves into Volta’s luxury submarine, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to explore the infrastructure of Volta’s house.
There is nothing to save in the final detail, but although the picture is lively and energizing, though some of the child material in it is in its entirety.
Moderate material.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t but think: can the British film industry let Rowan Atkinson get a role that really fits his abilities?
The Labour Party refuses that he is preparing a four-day work week plan for the UK, with the same salary as five days a week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the report, the party wants companies to make use of savings generated from the revolution in artificial intelligence, and let employees benefit from one extra holiday.
Workers can spend three days on weekends without falling in wages.
Sources say that the idea would "fit" to the group's economic plan and its policy on improving the benefits of workers.
The Trades Union Congress has supported the shortage of the week for four days, as a means for workers to take advantage of changes in the economy.
A source from the upper divisions of the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “The policy audit is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“The change will not be overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that matches the approach of the party to transform the economy for the benefit of workers and for the overall industry policy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the goal is not supported by the entire team.
A spokesman for the Workers’ Party said, “Four days of work are not on the political paper and the party is not considering implementing it.”
John McDonnell, the Ministry of Shadow Business Minister, last week used the Workers’ Party conference to describe his ideas of social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "unknown predecessors" and "fruit collectors" supply companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get their whole share back as the government of the Workers' Party could put on "reduction" due to alleged iniquities.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers into corporate boards and create a joint holding fund to leave 10 percent of private assets to their staff, which could receive £500 of them annually in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say “60 minutes” whether FBI’s investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week-long delay in the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court judge, raising the question of whether her findings could get the Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the show “60 minutes” of Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could reveal something that made them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his college from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when the trial began, I said I spoke to the Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusations were put forward and asked, “Do you do this?”
He was determined, steadfast, undisputed.”
Graham's vote seems unchangeable.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would be an incredibly accusation to change it,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it steadily,” Graham added and spoke to Christine Blasey Ford.
“Everyone she mentioned in her name couldn’t confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I can’t see anything new will change.”
What is the International Civic Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The International Citizen Festival (Global Citizen Festival) will be held on Saturday in New York. It is an annual music event where a series of big stars will emerge and with a similarly influential strategy; to end poverty around the world.
This is the seventh year that the International Civic Festival is held and tens of thousands of people will fly to Central Park, not only to listen to music scenes from Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to end sore poverty by 2030.
The International Civic Festival, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, but there are international fighters who want to end poverty by increasing the number of those who fight against it.
To get free tickets to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), concert guests needed to complete various projects, or “actions”, such as working volunteering, sending emails to any of the world’s leaders, calling a call, or using other valid ways to help draw attention to their goals of ending poverty.
But how much success has the festival achieved, now that 12 years are on the path to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concerts in a real way to convince people to call for action, or is it just but one so-called “click action” - where people feel it does something that matters by signing up the online credit list or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “actions” from its supporters, to call for a variety of different goals.
It says these actions have helped get the world’s leaders to declare commitments and policies equal to over $35 billion that will affect lives over 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications due to its actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have been invested or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in the UK who work to “help children to enjoy themselves to the fullest,” and promised to give 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, having received 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can let the social injustice that underertion is belonging to the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition to the London concerts in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5000 calls were sent that Britain should improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
In a list of common questions on the group’s website, one question is as follows: “Why do you think you can put an end to sorrowful poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will fail all the time.
But, we will reach our goals, just like movements that fought for civil rights and abolished racial separation before us, for we are stronger together.
This year’s events include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe.
“The United States could use the Navy as a “obstruction” to prevent Russian energy exports,” the Minister of the Interior said.
"If necessary," Washington could use the naval forces to prevent energy in Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East," the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said in a statement.
Zinke argued that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially since the country works there, would be a pretext to explore the new market.
“I think the reason for their being in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy, as in Eastern Europe and its southern part,” he said.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and methods to impede it.
“The United States can use the naval force to ensure that sea routes are open and to form a barrier, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them does not come on the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called itself the “voice of the energy industry” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said it was more or less the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more and less utilizing energy sources and replacing them for others,” he said, saying Russia has only one card in memory with an economy that would be dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come after Trump’s government wants to increase its exports to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, officials under Trump’s leadership, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project to put forward a new power management, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly claimed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 power supply, which will double the transfer capacity of the current pipeline up to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
Russians say Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply driven on for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the opinion that energy must not be a tool to apply pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers,” said Russia’s energy minister, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to not take part in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I’m very unhappy that outside states are replacing our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, Chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “respect seriously” to bid for the presidency in 2020.
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "be seriously thinking" to bid herself to president after the mid-term elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider preparing for a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and go to our government, and they also need a woman as a leader,” she said.
“After 6th November, I will consider seriously to invite myself to the office of President.”
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting and said he was "going with the country in the wrong direction."
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracies,” she said.
Warren has been disgruntled by his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: “Of course, we have to let the FBI investigate the matter before the vote takes place.”
A survey published on Thursday shows, however, that the majority of voters in the state of Warrens do not think it should be offered by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the Senator should not be offered, according to a poll published by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent claimed to support her supply.
The survey showed greater support for Deval Patrick’s former governor, with 38 percent claiming to support his possible availability and 48 percent claiming to be against it.
Among other popular Democrats who were discussed for a possible presidency in 2020 were Joe Biden, former Vice President, and Bernie Sanders, Senator of the Senate from Vermont.
Biden said he is going to make an official decision in January, according to a report from the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Traffic Traffic Disorder Track Palin at Donald Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, age 26, was in Iraq for a year after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, I feel with other families who are affected by shock disorder and the spiritual wounds with which our soldiers return home,” she told the audiences at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the enemy in the room” and said that her son and other soldiers “come back a little differently, they’re hardened and wonder if any respect is being borne for what their members in the army and the air forces and other divisions have done for the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for attempting to prevent the announcement of domestic violence and for the arms of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support challenge against new asylum seeker policy
Eighteen states and Washington City support legal challenge against the new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing hostilities or domestic violence.
The representatives of the states 18 and the city submitted a court report on Friday in Washington to support the asylum seeker protesting the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions prosecution committed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy has not been announced.
She said that her spouse, “and his violent sons, who were prostitutes,” had abused her, but American government officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The accused, who support Grace, declared El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries where problems related to gangs and domestic violence are increasingly increasing.
The new asylum seeker policy revokes a decision set by the appeals committee in 2014 to allow unfamiliar immigrants who fled home violence to apply for asylum.
The Washington State Prosecutor Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “shed for decades of state and international law.”
“The federal law requires a decision on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule,” the court said.
Lawyers further said in the report that the policy of denying immigrants about entry would be damaging to the US economy, claiming that immigrants were more likely to start a business and “because of an important labour force.”
Jeff Sessions, a state prosecutor, ordered immigrant judges to stop granting asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and abuse in June.
“Those who leave their home country for persecution based on race, religion, ethnicity or membership of a particular community group or political scrutiny can apply for asylum,” Sessions said in a statement.
The hospitals were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people deal with every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, the number of dead doubles
Conditions are becoming more difficult for those who survived.
“There’s a lot of excitement in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, when she comforted her sick son at the help center in the city of Palu.
“Public cars are always coming here.
There is little water.”
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes and searching for their waters to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed after the earthquake that measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and shoulder, were located outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were injured outdoors due to continued powerful aftershocks.
His tears filled his eyes when he told him how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
“I pushed up to the walls, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press and said his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador to China accuses of “prosecution” with “aggressional advertising”
A week after the official newspaper in China published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper to discuss the mutual advantages of trade between the two countries, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media to disseminate harvest.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, last Wednesday spoke of the Chinese newspaper's announcement in Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accused China of trying to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections that will be on November 6th. China denies this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections marked what officials told the Reuters news agency that there was a new level of increasing campaign from Washington to apply China pressure.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to push business, Beijing and Washington are in a continuous trade war, with new tariffs on both countries’ import products.
Chinese and American experts say China’s revenge customs were designed to harm exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, an ambassador to the United States of America in China and a former Iowa governor for the long term, but that state exports a lot of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in his introductory statement in Des Moines Register, “China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free media.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the government of China is taking advantage of the love of the American language freedom tradition and our free media by publishing costly advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said in a statement.
“In contrast, a few protests can be found in Beijing magazine stores, and no real reflection can be found on the different views that Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic policy, where the media is stuck under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's biggest newsletters got away from the offer to publish" his article, but he did not notice what it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are making female voters dismiss them for the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh language.
Experts have warned against negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid-term polls, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, who has faced allegations of sexual harassment.
Very strong feelings have been around this issue and most Republicans have already officially shown that they wanted to start a vote.
“These things cannot be supported,” said Grant Reeher, Professor of Politics at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, at The Hill for a paper published on Saturday.
Reeher doubted that Jeff Flake, Senate Senator of the Republican Republic of Arizona, was in the last minute of the FBI's investigation enough to calm the riding voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow and not November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokeswoman for the liberal group MoveOn, told Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang “November approaches!” when they protested at the walks of the Senate when the Republicans who ruled the Judiciary Committee decided to continue with the nomination of Kavanaughs, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“The interest and enthusiasm of voters will go up out of full power,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“People will say that interest has already been great and that’s true.
But he could be greater, especially with female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18-29, who do not like the president, but rarely vote."
The analysts predicted a backlash if Republicans pushed to confirm Kavanaugh, even for the testimony of Ford, declaring her accusations of sexual harassment from him.
“This has become a big clue for the Republican Party,” said Michael Still, a former member of the Republican Party National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be allowed to sit on the class, it’s also about how Republicans have dealt with this and how they’ve dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, President of the Priorities of the United States, a group that helps to vote for Democrats, at the news station.
However, the U.S. seems to disagree who should believe in the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and little majority support the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed certainly or probably the testimony from Ford, while 35 percent claimed to believe certainly or likely testimony of Kavanaughs.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they thought Kavanaugh probably or surely lied in their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the call from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations that Ford put forward and from at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, according to a report from the Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate Senate’s ruling committee last week, saying Kavanaugh had attacked her at the age of 17, and that he had been affected by alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh was carrying her genitals in front of her when they both attended a party at Yale University in the 1980s.
The man who invented the internet has plans to start a new internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the internet, plans to set up a spinning company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a firm based in the Berners-Lee open platform.
Solid enables users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access any information.
In a private interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “world dominance.”
“We have to do it now,” he said.
“It’s a historical moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
There is a list of contacts, task lists, calendars, music collections and other personal and work-related devices.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all present in one browser and all at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data store is that it is totally under the user's control who can access any information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment using data.”
According to John Bruce, the CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides access, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several programmers hired as developers to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world could create their own independent application with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to launch a complete change that would put their current business models on the head of one night.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a article published on Saturday at Medium that Inrupt had the aim of “creating energy in business and ecosystems that help protect the integrity and quality of the new website based on Solid.”
Berners-Lee transformed the internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion of the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even as he establishes Inrupt.
“I’m fully optimized for the next season of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Won: Priest and Holder of the Victorian Cross of the First World War
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian Cross in the First World War as a soldier has been acclaimed in his hometown 100 years later.
Pastor Bernard Vann, who played the position of a undersurgeon in the military, received the cross on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later, and he never learned that he had received the highest honour of the British Army.
His two grandsons uncovered memorials about him on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “very symbolic” that the memorial had been revealed just 100 years from his grandfather’s honour.
According to London Gazette, Vann led his supreme force on September 29, 1918, across the Canal de Saint-Quentin canal “through a very thick fog and under a harsh shooting from guns and machine guns.”
Later he ran to the shooting line and with "great courage" he led the line forward before he attacked a cannon one of his teams and overcame three soldiers.
The winner was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just months before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s heroes were “something I could never do, but something that makes a man humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a blossom after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was “a great honor to participate in the parade” and added that “the deaths of a true hero are shown with the support that so many show.”
MMA fans wake up all night to watch Bellator 206, got to see Gurru pigs instead
Just imagine, having awakened all night to see the overwhelming Bellator 206, just to be denied to see the main event.
On the agenda, there were 13 battles from San Jose, of which six on the main record, and they were aired live all night in the UK on the Channel 5 channel.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, the British audience unexpectedly attacked when the broadcast turned into Gurru pigs.
Some were dissatisfied after watching the battle all night.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to child material as “a kind of sick joke.”
“According to public rules, the subject was not a qualified audience at six o’clock in the morning so they had to switch to child material,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication for Bellator, when asked for the broadcast.
"Gurra pigs, yes."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator said they would review their timetables and take the UK audience into account in the future.
“I think when I think about the replay that we could probably solve this,” Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on Sunday there and we can't solve this until Sunday until our time, which is Monday with them.
But we are working on this.
Believe me, when it was changed, a number of text messages were sent back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn’t the case, it was an official problem.
I can promise you this won’t happen next time.
We limit the evening to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and passed out.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has “disambiguation” due to sexual orientation
The Olympian Tom Daley said he had been dissatisfied with other people in his upbringing for his sexual orientation, but it encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said he didn't realize that he was "unlike the other" until he went to a counter-educational school.
In Desert Island Discs on the Radio 4 channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that his parental role reduced his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular manager, has taken a few months off because of illness.
Daley first appeared as a “minder man” than everyone else when he was a child because “it was not agreed in society to be impressed with both boys and girls.”
He said: “Until today, these feelings of feeling less and differently give me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he would not be disappointed when he finally found out about his sexuality.
The binary of the Olympic Bronzehaf has been a great fan of LGBT and used its participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he was being heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without penalties and wanted to give others “hope.”
The world champion said it had "comprised him" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When a man walks through so much at an early age,” but he took part in his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all lifestyles" had been coveted.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold prize,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than a gold prize at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic Golden Prize.
His son is baptized into the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, forty years old, after diagnosing brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not agreed that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had received their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breath stopped and he was dead that I finally acknowledged that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze prize.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, dipping me in front of the audience at the Olympic Games. It doesn’t feel better,” he said.
It was also inspired to the selection of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
Mickelson in Bad Form and Dead in the Class in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find back his old beats so that the score is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the competition for the 12th time, which is a record, was allowed to sit on the class at the decision of Chairman Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-game competitions on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the hashes, as he has been so many times before the United States, the day of the five-fold champion is divided between being a clapper and practicing the plays on the field in the hope of correcting what is wrong with him.
Mickelson, aged 48, was never the one who shot directed with the killers, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Golf Course, where long glomps often punish for bad shots.
And not only is the golf course a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson needs to compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with newer Tommy Fleetwood in a team and together they have won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four stages below, are taking the first game of 12 matches, reaching a good start, the game of Mickelson could make a difference.
Fury expressed confidence in her husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, klapped me on my back and took hold of me and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is in the celebrity hall and he has been so much better for the teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I felt more, but that’s how it ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will record Nick Faldo in the number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the process in the Ryder Cup which has never reached as high as any other achievement on his record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said his presence had a certain vague impact on the team.
"He's funny, he's ironic, hilarious, enjoys making fun of people and it's great to have him in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed playing with him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives more than just the golf game.”
Thomas Bjorn, leader of Europe knows that a lot of advantage can disappear quickly
The European leader Thomas Bjorn knows from the experience that a good advantage for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily change into an unpleasant experience.
The dance first played in a game in Valderrama in 1997, where the side under the command of the leader Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but was able to correctly squeeze the victory at the end with a minimum possible score difference, with 141-2-131-2 wins.
“You’re constantly reminding us that we had a lot of advantage in Valderrama, we had a lot of advantage in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but just so,” said Bjorn, who is seen here on the photo, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 both on Friday and on Saturday and close to the National Le 10-6 success.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
We’ll all be ahead tomorrow.
Let's do everything right.
This is not done until all of the points are on the table.
We have our goal and it is trying to win this cup, we focus on it
I’ve always said this, I’m focused on the players 12 in our team, but we’re very aware of our opponents in the other team — the best golfers in the world.”
Bear was thrilled with how his players had been struggling, adding: “I never go beyond myself in this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow it’s the performance of the individuals that matters, and that’s another thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you play one, you’re tried on all people’s abilities as a golfer.
It’s the message you need to send the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and you also have to play your best game."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will seek to make his players stand better in individual games rather than with a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this big transition last day, but he was defeated by his team in Brookline, but ended up losing when Europe performed the “miracle of Medinah.”
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, “how Ben Crenshaw, the leader of 1999, would have encouraged his players to continue for the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When the crawler reaches the building, it causes a lot of pressure on the games that are in the middle.
We ordered our players according to that and let them play as we think will be the best tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the defense and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
"I chose these players in this order because I think they cover all the way through," Bjorn said about his choice of players in the individual competition.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The newest German naval ship should have been built in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until first next year due to faulty systems and ever-increasing costs, according to news in the region.
The building of “Rheinland-Pfalz,” the headship of the brand-new warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Party, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to sources from the military spokesman who spoke to the Die Zeit magazine.
The ship had to be taken into consideration by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the delivery the project preferred.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the British Army.
They should be equipped with a more powerful cannon, many anti-aircraft missiles and hiding techniques such as reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer usage times - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, continually delays mean that these ships of the latest type - which are said to enable Germany to demonstrate its strength on the sea - will be already expired when they are finally taken into service, says Die Zeit.
The F125 warship came to the news last year when the German army officially refused to take over the escapade and returned it to the Blohm & Voss drop in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorces, but German media talked about a number of women seriously “defects in software and hardware” that made the warship useless if sent to military.
Disadvantages in software were particularly important because the warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg category will be controlled by 120 crew, which is half less than on the military ships of the Bremen class.
It also found that the ship was too heavy, which reduces its performance and restricts the ability of the navy to make improvements to it in the future.
The 7000 tons of ship “Rheinland-Pfalz” is thought to be twice as heavy as the Germans used during World War II.
Besides the defects in the hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is starting to cause problems.
It is said to have reached EUR 3.1 billion, but was originally to be EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems that affect the latest ships are particularly important in view of the warnings that the Germans’ superiorities on the sea are decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Defense Committee, acknowledged that the naval forces were actually becoming “optical bodies with operational ships.”
The officer said that the problem had emerged over time, because older ships were removed, but no ships came in their place.
He regretted that none of the commands of the Baden-Wuerttemberg party could be adopted by the Navy.
National Trust Nature Protection Association spying on secret life of leather flakes
A new study in Scotland aims to find out how lumbers use the landscape as they hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in guiding natural protection measures in the future.
The study, led by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will monitor different types of leather stains in the Inverewe descent of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed in key locations around the area to monitor the behavior of the leather blurs over the period.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also go on tours with handheld sensors.
Experts will soundtrack all recordings to find out the frequency of calls, which the leather beetles emit, and what species do what.
Maps of habitats and reports will then be published to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a geographic scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s Northern Environment Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of habitat is most important for the lumbars and how they are used by each genre.
This information will help determine the benefits of managing habitats, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain forest land for leather bulbs and other related species.
Leather stains have declined considerably in the last century in Scotland and throughout the UK.
They are at risk for construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and lights can also cause risks, also fly paper and certain chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
I don't think the lips are really blind.
However, the ears help them better than the eyes when it comes to hunting beef, because they are used to hunting at night.
They used advanced electric targeting technology to find insects and objects that are on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes leather bulbs very seriously.
In the association, there are ten experts who carry out regular checks, nest checks and sometimes rescue operations.
The association has even established Scotland’s first and only forestry country at the Threave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten leather flakes of Scotland have homes.
David Thompson, the guardian of the farm, said he was a perfect area for them.
“The site at Threave is great for leather beads,” he said.
“We have old buildings, plenty of grown trees and plenty of good habitat.
But there are still a lot of ignorance about leather bulbs, so the job we work here and in other places will help us to better understand what they need to thrive.”
He emphasized the importance of checking leather bulbs before maintaining the habitat, as possible unintended destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 female bulbs and young and destroy all leather bulbs in the area.
Leather bulbs are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, harass or disrupt, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative at the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot left unlearned about leather bulbs, and we don’t know how well many of their species are going.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers prepare lawsuits against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called for accusations against him of rape "false news" and says people want to "wake attention to themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The leader of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 for silence over the incident, according to Der Spiegel.
A few hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, aged 33, said in an Instagram Live video with his 142 million followers that they were “false news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
“What was said today is fake news,” said the world champion fivefold to the camera.
“These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it’s part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added a smile.
Lawyers Ronaldos prepare to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations that they have called “unacceptable disclosure of suspicion regarding privacy,” according to the Reuters news agency.
Advocate Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would demand compensation for “a penetration of the same amount as the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player’s room, where he was said to have raped her in the anus, according to documents submitted for Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo had fallen on the knee after this incident and told her that he was "99 percent a good man" who had fallen into temptation because of "1 percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex, but that they had both consents.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but finally agreed to conciliators outside the courtroom because she was “dead of revenge” and worried about becoming “different publicly.”
Now she says she wants to stop because she's still in shock after a supposed incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to have occurred, and this summer he switched to the Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain would “repent forever” to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “seek for it forever” if it lost its position as a global leader among car manufacturers after Brexit, says Greg Clark, Secretary of Commerce.
He added that it would be "concerned" that the Toyota UK would have told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily cease its production factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car maker said the impact from losing the border if Brexit without a contract would be a reality would cost jobs.
Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European countries.
“My opinion is that if the UK elapses from the EU at the end of March, we’ll see production standards in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British automotive manufacturers have expressed concerns about exiting the EU without the consent of international trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say are captive chain risks if Brexit without a contract becomes a reality.
Toyota's production line is based on the reception at the "last hour", where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars manufactured by order.
If the UK withdraws without a contract on March 29, it could become an interference with the borders that the industry believes could lead to delay and lack of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day in their factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the Chequers programme Theresu May for future relations with the EU was specifically aimed at preventing these views at the border.
“We have to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us to enjoy not only success in modern times, but as an opportunity we can take advantage of,” he said on BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue with very successful approaches.
Toyota could not tell how long their production would stop, but warned that for a long time increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trustee in the factory, said that his colleagues were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they will never return.
The government spokesman said: “We have put forward a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
On Sunday, the White House declared that a significant meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, the Assistant State Prosecutor, could be “a resurgence in one week” now is the dispute due to Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, continues.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Muellers’ work, a special prosecutor who investigates Russian elections, links between Trump’s and Russia’s assistants, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the President’s hand.
For many weeks, rumors have gone on to Washington to see if Trump is going to run an Auxiliary Prosecutor and thus jeopardize Muellers’ independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein had been discussing bringing a recorder to take up conversations with Trump and the possibility of rolling the president out of office using the 25th additional article of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these statements.
But last Monday he visited the White House, among the news that he was going to resign.
Trump was announced on Thursday, but he was with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he “prefered not” to run Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to not be at the same time as the hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has accused him of sexual harassment, witnessed both.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI of allegations against Kavanaugh, which postponed the Senate vote further.
Sarah Sander, Trump's media agent, was on the show Fox News Sunday.
When asked at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not been decided for him, it could be this week. I think he may be postponed for another week because of everything else that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we can see and it’s always a pleasure to inform the media.”
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not due to the dissatisfaction that television reporters had “virtualism,” but she said, “I don’t disagree with the fact that they have virtualism.”
She then gave evidence that a direct relationship between Trump and the media would increase.
“The president answers more questions than any other president has ever done before,” she said, without referring to the sources: “We’ve reviewed these numbers.”
Media meetings will still take place,” Sanders said, “if the media have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We try to do a lot of it and you’ve seen us do a lot of it in the past few weeks and it’ll replace media meetings when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders visiting him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown the reason in New York this week, when he showed unprecedented and at times strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Health Minister writes EU personnel in the health system in Scotland for concern for Brexit
The Minister of Health has written staff from the EU working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to declare the nation’s appreciation and wish it to continue working after Brexit has gone through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter in less than six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to meet the costs of application for EU employees working in the public service sector.
Frk. Freeman wrote in his letter: “Over the summer, discussions between the UK and the EU have continued and decision-making is expected this fall.
The British government has also worked on the preparation if possible.
I know it must be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I want to point out again how much I appreciate the jobs of all the staff, no matter what their nationality is.
Partners from the EU and beyond come with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care jobs and are beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to stay."
Christion Abercrombie went through emergency surgery after having a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a liner for the Tennessee State Tigers had to undergo emergency surgery after having a head injuries in a 31-27 loss match against the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to a reporter from Mike Organ, reporter Tennessean.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State superintendent, told reporters that the injuries had fallen shortly before half time.
“He came to the sideline and fell down there,” Reed said.
Coaches and ambulances gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before being placed on a bar and carried out for further inspection.
A Tennessee State representative said Chris Harris, a radio broadcaster, WSMV, in Nashville, Tennesse, that Abercrombie had been in surgery at the hospital in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there was "no information about the type or severity of the impact yet" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is at school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
He had five people on Saturday before he left, which increased the total number of apparitions with him up to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged for higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged for higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK. The surplus will be used to assist homeless people, according to the new plan of the Conservative Party
The operation will disrupt the success of Corbyns campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp fees will be paid to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The government plans to raise £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged for higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK. The surplus will be used to assist homeless people. Theresa May will report this today.
The operation will be considered an attempt to destroy the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by promising housing at an affordable price and taxing highspeakers further.
Individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK need to pay higher stamp fees, and the surplus will go into government actions to help homeless people.
The increase - which is in addition to the current stamp fees, including the increase that was placed on two years ago on an extra home and real estate purchase for rent - could be up to three percent.
The government estimates that the increase will earn up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by foreign sources, which causes price increases and makes those who want to buy real estate for the first time harder to enter the market.
Many of the richest areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become “spiritual towns” due to the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new trend comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a decrease in stamp fees to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large building firms of keeping real estate high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas in homes at a affordable price to fix the UK’s “house” preferences.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of reputable improvements in housing issues, including the leases and endings of rentals without cause.
He also wants to give more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would devote myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first season — that every new generation should enjoy better quality of life.
And it involves fixing our undeserved real estate market.
Britain’s door will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be right that it is equally easy for foreign parties and companies with headquarters abroad to buy homes and for diligent British nationals.
For many, the dream of their own home is far too far away, and the shame of homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland.”
Jack Ross, coach of Sunderland, says it’s his “main goal” to become Scotland’s coach at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotland now enjoys the challenge of blowing a new life in the North-East club, which now sits third in the first division, three stages from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after returning to the Scottish Premier League in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
“I was injured on my knees and that’s why it was over,” Ross said in an interview with Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden often with my father as a child, and there’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only happen if I was able to train the team.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic Club coach said he did not feel any fear of following such famous names at such a large club, but he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town coaching positions.
“At the moment, I’ll recommend my success by thinking, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
“This club has no doubt at home in the Premier League because of its structure and facilities,” he said.
“It’s not an easy job to get him there, but I’d probably just consider myself as successful here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only three years of experience, as a coach, after a period as a Dumbarton assistant coach and 15 months as part of a Hearts coaching team.
He helped Alloa recover from falling into the third division, and transformed St Mirren, who was about to fall through the league, into a league champion next season.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he was ever at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real time,” he said about the season when he became a coach of Alloa.
“I really believed that the coaching work was suitable for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I went well, I had a fair income from it and enjoyed the possible success.
But change can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still go through it in terms of stress and pressure from the job, but the coaching work seems simply right for me.
“I always wanted to train, and now I do, I’ve never been better with myself in all my adulthood.”

The best time for a beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a survey
The heat wave this summer has proven profitable for British bars that have a base, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales at pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, but sales at restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant, CGA, who collected the figures, said: “Increasing sunshine and the unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern and June, when barsale increased by 2.8 percent, except what restaurants sold even less.
The sale fell by 1.8 percent in restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Bars and bars, which mainly focus on drinks, were the best of the day with more booms while restaurants went downstairs.
It was also difficult for people who sold food in the sun, but not as much as a restaurant.
People just seem to want to go out to drink.
Sales of drinks at pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent for the month, but food sales decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, from analytics company RSM, said: “These findings are the continuation of the fluctuation that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social events or sports events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales in markets outside of home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still have difficulties, though a sales reduction of 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful above the continued pressure caused by cost.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for dining places and only time will reveal whether to temperate temperatures, as we’ve had in August, will improve the situation.”
The total growth in sales at pubs and restaurants, including in newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting how possible the openings are.

One out of every five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
One in five children, up to 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they cover for their parents and teachers, according to the survey.
A survey that reached 20,000 students showed an increase in the “type of Insta” pages
The news has raised concerns about sexuality being published.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “primary” account that they show parents
One in five children, up to 11 years old, create secret accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey that reached 20,000 students showed a huge increase in “type of Insta” accounts - which is a reference to the website Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about sexuality being published.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a clean “primary” account to show parents, as well as having secret accounts.
One mother, who fell down on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website, found a teenager who encouraged others to “push me.”
The study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Senate of the Private School Manager (HMC), showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of HMC, said: “It’s a concern that so many teenagers are tempted to create an online area where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an executive officer at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful athlete, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said that the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive experience in the international field in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect within sports communities in Scotland, Britain and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would profit a lot from getting it to the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope that I can make my contribution and help lead the sport forward in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and has a total of four Olympic golds, and is now a regular visitor at the BBC, was paralyzed after a short-lived blood depletion.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would reveal if I recovered and then to what extent.
It’s been a hard job, but I’ve come to a full level, learned to walk again and do sports exercises today!
“Thank you for your encouragement!”
Breast pump advertising, which compares mothers with cows, causes online discrepancies
A company that produces breast pumps is now mentioned online for advertising that carries lactating mothers with cows that are lactating.
The company Elvie published an advertisement to mark the introduction of what is said to be the “first silent breast pump in the world that can be worn outside”. The advertisement is inspired by music videos and should show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four real mothers dance in a ladder full of hay and we cut a song with a lyrics like, “Yes, I milk, but you can’t see a tail on me” and “If you didn’t notice it, it’s not yoga, but my breasts.”
The argument continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the kids, pump, pump, pump, I pump milk from the jules.”
However, the advertisement, which appeared on the company’s Facebook page, has resulted in an online review.
The video features 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has received varying feedback from the audience, who tells many that it is "the horror" that follows the milk industry.
“It’s a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like we do, they have to become calfful and carry to produce milk, except what the calfs are taken from them just a few days after they are born,” one comment said.
Elvie bra pump fits conveniently in the breast donor holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another viewer wrote: “It’s very difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of line with time.”
Others brought the ad to the defense, and one woman admitted that the song was "abbreviated."
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would have bought it if I had a baby.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping out milk.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I took it as it is.
“It’s a great thing,” one of the audience wrote.
Another said: “This is a fun ad directed to mothers who pump milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like “cum.”
This is not an advertisement that boasts or judges the milk industry.”
At the end of the ad, the women's group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their breasts.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say they feel like cows when they pump milk.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipelines and fits comfortably into a bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby and go even out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and chief executive, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that she deserved a prominent presentation that would bring about.
By comparing women to cows, we wanted to direct the cast light to breast pumping and all of her challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much the freedom feeling of the new pump would give.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has come to the news.
At the London fashion week, a two-child mother appeared on a fashion show for the designer Mörta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved quietly to camps near Texas border
The number of immigrant children in prison has increased suddenly even though the number of those crossing the border monthly has remained somewhat the same. Part of the reason is that hard speeches and policies that the government of Trump has put forward have made it harder to bring their children into temporary foetus.
Usually, the fetal parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and have fear of putting their chances of staying in the country at risk, by offering themselves to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when the public authorities announced that possible fetal parents and other adults within the home would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the Immigration Authority.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of the Immigration and Customs Authority, witnessed before the Senate and said that his institution had arrested a number of people seeking to feed single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on the file.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foetal parents or in a home that fosters children are illegal in the country, and much of them are illegal immigrants on the file.
“We continue to look for the individual,” Albence said.
In an effort to work faster on children's issues, representatives announced new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month after they were placed in custody, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous criteria, according to staff working in the complaints.
Many of them will appear through video sessions, rather than in person, to bring arguments for their legal position before the referee in immigration matters.
The children who are ineligible for entry into the country are immediately sent out of the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or refugee attempts, according to the workers of the athletes and reports published by the system in the past few months.
Speakers said these problems were even more likely to be in a larger institution, as in Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that even if a child has difficulty, because of how many of them are.
They added that the transfer of children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or greeting friends could increase the shock that many of them are already facing.
Syria says the U.S., France and Turkey are withdrawing immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also said in his speech at the General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even if the country's war is now in their eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Vice-President, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false assumption that they countered terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly.”
“They have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he told the Senate.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism was almost over,” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to carry on this sacred struggle until we cleanse all Syrian areas - both by terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign parties."
The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, with most of them training and counseling both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that situations were good enough for them to return and he taught “some Western countries” to “wide out unreasonable fears” that urged refugees to stay away.
“We have called on an international community and humanitarian organization to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They’re creating politics out of something that should be just a humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will provide no funding for rebuilding in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN officials say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral area with the last large fortress of the resistance has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The treaty between Russia and Turkey prevented large attacks by Syrian forces backed by Russia, in the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had "different final deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would focus on jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters, who are connected with Al-Qaeda, and that they "should be exterminated."
Staffan de Mistura, the U.S. Ambassador, hopes to be able to attend the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition, to convene the constitution for Syria after the war and pay the street for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that her jobs should be limited to “reviewing the provisions of the current government,” and warned all interventions.
Reasons Trump will win another election season
According to that reasoning, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 re-election, unless charges and insults end his presidential career, as many liberal audiences are likely to hope.
What would be the most dramatic end of a presidential career ever?
Currently, the audience has no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, views of the best time have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best time, an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the episode MSNBC, “The Rachel Maddow Show” has peaked the audience with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, ABC’s director of dramas, “Designated Survivor,” said about an employee in the government who will be President after the House is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and writer of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another hypothesis.
She remembers a taxi in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” said Mrs. Scovell to me.
There is a lot of fun in the mess.
However, unlike what is shown on TV, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can unite and the health of the international economy.
Only those who enjoy what the most privileges can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you look at the sixth time on a group of experts logicing the use of Bob Woodwards on ‘aphir intimate’ sources for his book ‘Fear’, or $15,000-dollar jacket made of a skirt that Paul Manafort wore (“a like that is fed with pride,” said the Washington Post) and the consequences of exact life.
I will never see Super Mario again.
“The part of what he does feel like a real-life episode is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the episodes “Pawn Stars” when he talked about the employee's role in the show Trumps and daily changes in the story (e.g. starting a fight with N.F.

Money on the outside flow in the worst elections of the Middle Ages
It is no surprise that the 17th constituent region of Pennsylvania sees the money flowing to it, thanks to the reorganization of constituent areas that led to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly organized Pittsburg area forwards Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a second seat in a special election last summer.
Lamb welcomes other representatives, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old 12th constituency in Pennsylvania, which surpasses the new 17th constituency.
The maps of constituencies were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituencies were organized in favor of the Republicans and that it violated the constitution.
The race in the new 17th election zone has been the start of a competition in the funding of election campaigns between the major funding partners of both parties, the Democratic Election Committee (DCCC) and the NRCC.
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a brief victory in a special election in March before the 18th constituency in Pennsylvania, but many watched those elections.
Republicans had previously held that seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a victory in the election zone with 20 points.
Political experts have given democrats a bit of an advantage.
The U.S. was considering punishing El Salvador because of its support for China, but then retired.
Reichspeople noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with small remarks from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the co-owners of Trump's group run away.
The Foreign Ministry representatives decided to call back the U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “new decision to recognize Taiwan no longer,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman of the Ministry in a statement early this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties, which were laid down and included, among other things, the reduction in financial support and restrictions on the issue of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, where high unemployment rates and mortality rates are high.
As residential meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives postponed a conference on security and economic success and were to follow a similar meeting held last year, which was considered a step forward in action to prevent people from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, representatives from the top ranks made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and thus ended all the speculation of punishment against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now to address the conference, which is to be held in mid-October, as a symbol of how important it is in the eyes of the government, said the reporters.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard message or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss the discussions expressed by the three U.S. Representatives, including two delegates, who agreed to discuss the interior discussions against being anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the government and also spoke of the matter against anonymity.
Learning the Story
The next harassment could be Robert Mueller’s report, a special prosecutor, about Mr. Trump’s possible actions to prevent justice, but for that allegation there are numerous public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller is also redirecting his investigation to whether Mr. Trump’s campaign has worked with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the parliament is governed by another party, Trump may have to be responsible for it, at the time he prepares to meet his voters again, and perhaps the jury appointed his peers.
However, it’s very unaware and I don’t want to say that Trump’s fall is unequivocal, nor is his colleague’s fall in Europe.
We all have to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938, German officials were willing to rob Hitler, only if the Western countries had given him resistance and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the disasters that followed.
The story is about such important points and faster or delays for the unstoppable progress of the democracy.
Americans are faced with such important points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump runs the Rod Rosenstein State Prosecutor, the man who runs Mr. Mueller's fate investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this paper reported that last year he had suggested to make secret recordings of the president and discussed whether he was ineligible in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
“How will we respond if the new FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court judge despite credible charges of sexual harassment and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-season session that will give Mr. Trump responsibility?
If we fall on these tests, the democracy will have to wear a long winter.
But I don’t think we’ll fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and sat before in my ambassador's residence.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to turn on the Sabbath candles on the table with the hakacross.
With such an legacy, how can I look at our future?”

Graham Dorrans, team member Rangers, optimized for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will bring them into a strong position to get out of the G-team of the European League. Rangers made an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
Injuries to the knee prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game in the season until the game against Villareal, which ended with a 2-2 draw, but he believes Rangers can take advantage of the results as a jumpboard for better results.
“It was great to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” Dorrans said.
“We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Maybe we could have claimed a victory in the end, but in the whole, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got strong into the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important evening for the European Union.
Hopefully we can reach three levels, but it will be a tough game because they went well in their last game. But with the audience who support us, I’m sure we pulled this and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that happened in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling at the site.
The team is good and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go further now, put the last season behind us and succeed.”
Women Lose Sleep Because Fear of Losing Retirement Savings
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said they talked with their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children.
“People want a family member to annoy it, but it doesn’t take the right steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Department.
That's how it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t make them light with good notice.
Talk to your advisor and your family about where and when you get care, because these options can change a lot in terms of cost.
Get your financial advisor on the issue: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care include traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay costs, or self-insurance with your own money - as long as you own it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal disputes in advance.
Get a health care officer so that you can designate someone you trust to manage your health care and ensure that your health care professionals will meet your preferences if you can’t tell them directly out yourself.
Also consider getting a profound for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your old father or mother is in an emergency and is on the way to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Please provide that information accurately in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about the finances, but also who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will guard the dog?
“Take that plan ready.”
Man shot multiple times with a gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an aerial gun when he was on his way home walking after having been out having fun.
The victim is a man at the age of fifties and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Representatives describe the shooting attack, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m. at the British local time, as "attack randomly."
The victim did not see his assailant.
The man was not injured and the police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
At least 384 died after a powerful earthquake and flooding in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the representatives said, and it is expected that the numbers of the dead will rise.
Since all communications are underneath, aid workers have been unable to provide any information from Donggala County, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left home after the accident.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379.800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and flooding began.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 380 km of the coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi.
The administration, under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Solawesi region, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of them are in Morowali, which is on the beach opposite Sulawesi.
Flood waves have shuffled Palu and Donggala several times in the last century, according to the Indonesian disaster organization.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when the flooding was over, and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
It also occurs in the western part of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the active fire circle of the Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the main earthquakes and floods of the past few years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh region in the north of Sumatra ran over on December 26 and launched a flood that hit 14 countries and killed 266,000 people across the Indian Ocean coast, of which more than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes crossed the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people are killed on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 on Richter ran over the southern part of Jövu, the largest island in Indonesia, causing a flood that crashes on the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake on Richter ran over near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of western Saratoga.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on Richter crossed one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, raising up to 10 meters high flood waves that destroyed a number of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake raged over the Pidie Jaya county in Aceh and caused destruction and savagery when people remembered the destruction in the deadly earthquake and flooding wave in 2004.
No flood waves formed this time, but over 100 died when buildings collapsed.
2018: Large tremors ride over the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia and more than 500 people died, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were stuck temporarily on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former prime minister of Alaska and the presidential candidate, has been arrested for the charges of body assault.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, trying to block the announcement of domestic violence and stressing the arrest, according to a report from the Alaska State Police Department, which was published on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from her friend when she tried to call the police to report a alleged offence.
Palin is held at Mat-Su station where he is awaiting an audition before a court, and he is held against $500 insurance, according to a report from KTUU.
He was courted on Saturday, when he declared that he was "not guilty, no doubt" when asked to declare a guilt or innocence, according to the news agency.
Palin is charged with three offences in category A, which means he could be sentenced to jail for up to one year and would have to pay 250,000 dollars a fine.
He has also been charged with offences in category B, which is punished with one day in prison and $2,000 a fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged assault.
The case is now being dealt with in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, for obstructing the announcement of domestic violence and for carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in the incident.
His wife claimed to have hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of surrender troops in 2016 after she taught a shocking stress disorder about her son's violent behavior, following his military service in Iraq.
earthquake and flooding in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 on Richter started a flood and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems are downstairs, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake was just in the middle of the Sulawesi Island, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident was now going around on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered together at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the flooding wave struck the beach.
Prosecutors are seeking a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
New York prosecutors want a death penalty over Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected to have been involved in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been used in the county for violations of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, is believed to have taken the Home Depot truck on hire to attack people on the road along the West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan. He drove there down pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the victims eight “wildly” and caused serious physical injuries “wildly,” according to the declaration of will to apply a death penalty, which was registered in the Southern District Court in New York.
Both these charges can lead to possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal court charged Saipov with 22 teams, including eight charges of murder for criminal purposes, which are commonly used by prosecutors in charges against organized criminal associations. Saipov was also charged with violent crime and for destroying the vehicle.
The attack included “measurely planned planning,” prosecutors said, declaring Sapiov’s work as “horrible, cruel, and immoral.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was chosen as a body injury, injury and loss for families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.”
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been decades since the Southern province of New York last took a death penalty trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a New York court case in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, couples who were killed after being convicted for pursuing the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the investigator that he was doing well with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had received the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 teams of charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s official defenders, said they were “evidently disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to ask for a death penalty instead of accepting a guilt declaration against lifetime imprisonment without the possibility of a trial solution will only extend the shock due to this event for all the parties,” Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The Senator of the Conservative Party said that NIGEL FARAGE should lead negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage pledged to "act the people's army" today to protest at the conference of conservatives.
This former leader of Ukip said that politicians would have to “feel under pressure” from aphesians about the EU, at the same time as one of Senators Theresu May suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone said to the Birmingham protest march that Britain “would go out” now if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by May in recognizing a deep dispute between her own team members came even better to light is that conservatives, who want to remain in the EU, took part in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep Chequers’ plan on the right track and sits under criticism from those who are accustomed to Brexit, those who are opposing, and the EU.
Allies claimed that she will continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - and force those who are opposed to Brexit and the Workers' Party to choose between her plan and "irrage".
Mr. Bone said to Leave Means Leave the Solihull protest march that he wanted to “lose to the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been able to participate and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were on the board, we’d be out now,” he said.
Senator Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone pointed out that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: “The idea that the British public has changed opinion and wants to stay around is absolutely false.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative supporter of Brexit, was also on the protest march and said to reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular among the public and the opposition will not vote with it. It enjoys unpopularity among our party members and activists who are on the streets and elect us.
Please, stop the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a direct message to May, she added: “Premier ministers keep the job when they conform to their promises.”
Mr. Farage said the politicians would have to "feel for pressure" if they were going to turn away from the decision made following the vote in 2016.
"It's about trust between us - the people - and our political party," he said.
“They want to betray Brexit and we’re here together today to say, ‘We won’t let you get away with this.’”
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to let your political party, which is about to turn away from Brexit, feel pressure.
We are active in this country of the general public, which gave us victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.”
At the same time, supporters of the EU held a demonstration in Birmingham which ended with a two-hour protest meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the flags of conservatives against Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis, of the Workers' Party, made fun of conservatives for security issues that came up in the party's phone app when the conference was opened.
“These are the people who tell us that it can have all the computer systems ok and all the technology for Canada plus, for borders without obstacles, for free trade with Ireland without borders,” he added.
“It’s an absolute scandal.
“There’s nothing that can be called a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren is going to “consider seriously” to offer himself to the presidency.
Elizabeth Warren, US Senator, said he was going to “consider a serious supply to the presidential office” after the November elections.
Boston Globe says the Democrat from Massachusetts has talked about his future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has seldom criticized President Donald Trump, is preparing for a re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-directed in the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the centre of the question that she could offer herself against Trump by 2020.
The Holyoke meeting on Saturday was her 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with residents in her constituency, since Trump took office.
One of the members of the meeting asked her if she wanted to be president.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to go to Washington, and we need a woman as a leader.
An arrest after a deadly shooting on Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot dead on Friday.
Baton Rouge police reported arrest at Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old at a news meeting at 11 a.m.
She had previously released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a person who was seen on the recording.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was shot dead near Southern University campus early on Friday.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died because of it,” said Chief Murphy J. Paul, on Saturday, a report from 247sports.
Wayde came to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been on the scene, with weapons in his way, and admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and imprisoned at the police department in eastern Baton Rouge.
Sims was two metres tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, out of which 10 in the start team during the last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 runs in each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the winning seat at the command of their team.
It was obvious from the time Valtteri Bottas got a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before starting on Saturday, that commands from Mercedes would play a major part in the race.
Bottas got a good start at the start and left Hamilton almost as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight his teammates.
Vettel first went to the pit and allowed Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been able to determine the results.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged after a few conflicts where the driver Ferrari was forced to leave the inner side after having been at risk of being left behind, after defensive attempts in the third turn.
Max Verstappen was in seventh place at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he postponed replacing tires to try to finish quickly and pass from Kimi Raikkonen and reach fourth place.
He finally went to the pit in the 44th circle, but could not increase the speed of the eight remaining circles, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
This is a difficult day because Valtteri was a beautiful man all weekend and was a true master to let me out.
“The team has been great to achieve this success,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body.
Donald Trump, U.S. President joked to Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, due to her allegations that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, with the accusation of Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not directly discuss the testimony of Ford for the Senate Senate’s Judgment Committee. Instead, he said that what went on in the Senate session showed that people were “bad and cruel and untrue.”
“The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and cruel and untrue,” he said.
“When you see the displays and the leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you find this?
Do you remember her answer: “Oh, what?”
Oh, no.
I don't leave it."
Wait a minute.
“No, we didn’t,” he said, simulating the Senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the accusations from Ford against Kavanaugh appeared, and therefore were leaked early in September. Feinstein refused that the leak had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I didn’t leave her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it in custody and I did as she asked me.”
But her denial didn’t seem to go well down to the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you, it was really bad body weight.
Maybe she didn’t work, but it was the worst body weight I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued his defense against Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and claimed that Democrats were taking advantage of the accusations.
“They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods to apply.
You see the cruelty, evil, no matter who they hurt, who they have to choose over to gain control and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 - 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars added for their loss in the Elite League league against the Belfast Giants, winning the next game, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-point advantage from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equated for locals, but Dwyer returned Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen then guaranteed their victory.
This was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe in the Elite League, which had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game between the teams during the season, and Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute at 3:35 a.m., after a support from Kendall McFaull.
There was so much to be in the first minute and Sullivan returned to the game when the time showed 13.10 and Cownie then matched after the support from Matt Marquardt in the fifteenth minute.
Dwyer made sure to bring the Giants over before half time when he scored his second goal in the game at the end of the first play.
The team got together and Bouchard returned after a goal when they were one man over to the 27th minute of the second play.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated and helped Nielsen bring Dundee over for the first time in the game late in the second stage and he secured his team's victory with the fifth goal when half the last stage was over.
Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, welcome Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic manager kills to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escapes earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic manager has been acclaimed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take on the air whole and covered.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and started a flooding wave.
Large aftermaths continue to preserve the area and many are trapped under ruins in the city of Palu.
The 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his colleagues had fled the control tower that swayed violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake crashed, could safely fly.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
He later died in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sad to hear about it,” he added.
Authorities fear that the number of dead may exceed 1,000, when the country’s disaster agency says access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The number of deaths is still increasing because many bodies are still under ruins and they cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six-metre-high-waves have caused massive destruction in Palu, which will be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft work to bring help and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There is little about clean water.
The shops have been robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is competing to find survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the projects related to the evasion.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia Air Niugini says the same thing is missing after a plane crashes into a reservoir
The airline, which had a plane crashing into a lake in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from and with the afternoon of Saturday, it did not know about the resignation of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about the passenger's details, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when she attempted to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, the officers said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all of them were stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact order of the incident was.
The airline and the US Navy both said the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the highway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the flight had been very low.
“It was really good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others could water the mid-deep water and get to emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots had been scared and screaming and that he had a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that seamen who were at work just away from making up a pier also helped with the rescue by using a bloated boat to ferry people to land, before the plane sank in about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Flight Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in PNG-registered aircraft crashes in the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in re-enactment of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for several hours as an expert in information analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile records to put together the trips of the accused 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessicu Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chamber at the same time he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was "a lie, because my car was in Nashville."
Tellis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks before her death.
Mobile phones showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls and contact information from her phone.
“He ruined her from her life,” Hale said.
It is estimated that the defenders will make their final talk on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be filed later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hipp jump?
Hipp hopp trieyker wants to fight negative opinions against the musical genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop had removed its origins where it contained political messages and discussed social issues.
They want to look for the origins again and make the conscious hipp jump popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent boom in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Parents in New York are prosecuting couples for expedition after "disambiguous" text messages
A parent in New York is suing a couple for an unlawful eviction after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple refuses to be prejudiced and resembles the prosecution of “financing.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, declared dissatisfaction when she found out that her new foster, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
“NEEEEEIIIII OTHER SWEED MONEY,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering his mistakes, Plasco-Flaxman, Mr. Maurice, “founded” and said that their ex-wifes, who was black, had been bad, and that she had expected a Filipino woman, according to a report from the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for his one-day work and then sent home in a Uber car.
Maurice is now prosecuting the couple and wants to receive compensation for the expiration, an amount of $350 per day for the six-month job she had initially been hired, although no agreement has been signed.
“I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do that,” she said in an interview with Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is a discrimination.”
The couple have objected to the allegations that they are prejudiced and say it was the right thing in the case to fire Maurice, because they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message she didn’t want to say.
She's not prejudiced.
“We’re not prejudiced people,” Joel Plasco told Post.
“But who would have trusted their children for someone after exercising their immorality, even if it was a surprise?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco compared the prosecution to “financing,” and said his wife had come seven months on the way and was in “a severe difficult situation.”
“Are you going to attack someone in this situation?”
It’s not very beautifully done,” said Plasco, who works in the investment industry.
The case is still before the court, but the public has gone hard on the pair of social media and shamed it for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers should have difficulty talking to a talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bonds, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put himself in someone’s footsteps that reads it for the first time before it was published.
“It’s very funny now that we know of the huge success of Paddington.”
She said that her father, who worked as a master at the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a small toy bear, had taken the rejection of his works with a calm positive, adding that the sixty-year edition of the book was "good-bearing" after his death last year.
As far as Paddington is concerned, as she describes as “a very important family member,” she added that her father had been quietly proud of his success in the end.
“He was a very silent man and not used to mocking himself,” she said.
“But as Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like when you have a child who accomplishes something. You’re proud of it even if you didn’t really do it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the honour.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she wasn’t expected to survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Since then Nad called me and said she would die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given to her to keep her heartbeat up were gradually losing their function and being separated from her body.
She had died soon before and it was her body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her dead daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
“No one knew anything,” she said.
“I had my head broken and my tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a lot of sympathy with Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sick women hang up a message to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who had a loved one who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up a message on a bridge in Wales, with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, the son of Miss Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want a parent to feel like I need to feel every day,” she said.
Frk. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, saying her son had been a successful chef with an infectious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could illuminate any room.”
He stopped working before he died, because he was “sucked down to a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, at the age of 11, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Mr. Davis said, “I am constantly worried that it will be a repercussions of it.”
Miss Davis made the message “to let people know that it’s possible to go and talk to others, even a friend.
“Don’t sit and say nothing, you have to talk to someone.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, his spouse until 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t talk about him feeling bad or being depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't look at them or anything."
She said that his death was a great shock to them, but that they had to work their way out: “This tears a hole in the family.
It breaks us apart.
We have to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a blue thread when the FBI has its investigation
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a limited time and scope study - we might be able to achieve a little bit of harmony," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "take apart" in the middle of a dispute between the parties where everything was in rear lock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican Party not want the FBI to investigate the matter?
It’s because of the timing.
The mid-term polls are in only five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans fail, as expected, they seriously weaken their attempts to get their husband chosen to sit in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met Ashley, his wife through him, but she was the private secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its research report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sitting at the moment.
It is still uncertain whether Mr. Kavanaugh could receive at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break up the draw and confirm him as the Supreme Court judge.
The number of people fleeing North Korea "decreases" under Kim's control
The number of people fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean Senator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted data from the South Korean Congress and said that 1127 people had fled last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border warnings between North Korea and China and higher charges charged by traffickers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any public statement.
Most of those who fled North Korea are invited to obtain South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Korean residents have been illegally crossing the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most people flee to China, but it has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross them rather than the well-respected neutral area between North and South Korea.
China sees refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forces them to return home.
Communication between North and South Korea, still in war, technically seen, has improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions that mainly dealt with postponed nuclear weapons negotiations.
This was after a historic June meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in the direction of a nuclear-free Korean shark.
On Saturday, Ri Yong Ho, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, taught American businessmen about the lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances, it is impossible to take down our nuclear weapons alone first,” R said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “motherly ill” and says he is incapable of performing the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority, called Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, “mother-sick,” and told him too much mood to be able to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave these words to an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t do anything but think that if a woman had ever done this, she would have been called motherly ill,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate’s Judgment Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he had sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes crying out and got a cake in his neck when he talked about his family and school years.
He also publicly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him “unreasonable and organized assassination” that was organized by liberal men who were angry at Hillary Clinton having lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not act on the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was biased against democrats.
“I think these assertions and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is incompatible with the job,” she said.
Pelosi did not respond when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh out of office if he is confirmed and if Democrats reach a majority of the Senate.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling the Senate or the FBI the truth, he's not only incapable of being in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion act Roe v. Wade, where he is believed to be a conservative judge.
At the interrogation, Kavanaugh questioned whether he would amend certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is no time for a motherly, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say, ‘It’s wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to use it.
It’s a fair speech, months and years of wrath flowing out, and it doesn’t come off without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Mrs. Steinem to me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s uncommon, but you?”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was the manager somewhere and said she was crying too when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and started crying, she said to her spokesperson, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
Then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from my previous job I had at the office with men in the majority, where I began to cry of wrath that I couldn’t express, came an older woman and took in my backyard. She was a cold boss that I had always feared a bit and she pulled me into the stairs.
“Let’s never see you cry,” she said.
They don't know you're insane.
They think you’re sad and happy to have reached you.”
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was in the presidency, and she was then a senator of the Colorado Democrats.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested by an adultery on board a boat called Monkey Business (Apaspil) and pulled his supply back, Mr. Schroeder considered, full frustration, that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to president.
“It wasn’t a good decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
“Someone named this “Small white and the seven dwarfs.”
Since the election campaign had passed, she was afterwards in terms of fundraising, so she vowed not to offer herself unless she was able to collect 2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she spoke her speech and announced that she would not formally offer herself, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who had supported her, anger towards the system, which made it so difficult to earn money and direct her eyes to voters instead of representatives, and anger out into gender discrimination - that she burst into crying.
“It could be thought that I had a nervous attack,” Schroeder said, remembering how the media reacted.
“I think Cleenex would be my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my stone?
“She cried?”
Reasons why trade wars between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the United States and China were awkward, and although the war is far from over, the gap between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
President Donald Trump shot the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s main export products, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
This week’s biggest boost came with new tolls covering goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), and taxing nearly half of all products imported to the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same coin every time and recently put 5 to 10 percent tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. customs warfare, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon be abandoned.
To get Washington to clash, it would be too humiliating for China’s President Xi Jinping to turn off the U.S..
However, experts say that if Beijing holds the cards right, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing the mutual need for both economic systems for each other.
“The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to circumstances that lead to economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than the audience has previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria “ready” for refugees to return, Foreign Minister said.
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return willingly to the country and seek assistance to rebuild the country, which is now in bad condition after seven years of war.
Mr. Walid al Moualem, the Secretary of State, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly and said that the situation in the country would improve.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to establish normal situations by building areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
Now everything is ready for refugees to return willingly to the country they were forced to leave for terrorism and unilateral economic decisions aimed at their daily lives and employment.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six more million people still in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said Syrian authorities would like to receive help to rebuild the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept aid depending on conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by winning the United States team with the final score of 16.5 against 10.5 points at the Le Golf National field outside Paris in France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on a European basis and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe reached the crown again when the team, led by Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 levels it needed to conquer the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled the most throughout the race, hit his start in the water of the 16th hole, which is a pair 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined brightly in all of his games, becoming 1 in 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the competition began using its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark, who was the second in the ranking of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is in the top spot on the world’s top golfer list, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, possibly playing in his final race for the Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times over the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European champion with a 25.5 degree.
“I don’t cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the team, and it was a pleasure to be able to help," Garcia said after Europe's victory.
John Rahm won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a solitary match on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him,” 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now registered with a 13-21-3 contest for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange result for one of the best players of the story, who has won 14 big titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a tough weekend to find themselves on the field, besides Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
U.S. leader Jim Furyk said after disappointment with his team’s performance, “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was sometime in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him down.
I'll take it down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players play very well.
We get back together, I will work with PGA in the United States and named the Ryder Cup and we will continue.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their leader.
You have to take it down.
They played better than us.”
