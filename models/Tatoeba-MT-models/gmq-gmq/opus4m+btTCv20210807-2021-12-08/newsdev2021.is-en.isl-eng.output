Biden leads surveys in three key states
After only 100 days of election, Joe Biden, a Democrat candidate, enjoys an advantage in three important swing states.
CNN reported today that Biden was in Florida, Arizona and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden recommends a 51% follow-up to the President.
In Arizona, 49%-45% of Biden's position is at hand and in Michigan is heading for Biden's superiority, leading by 12 levels, 52%-40%.
In order to win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump has to turn all of these states, and indeed more.
Trump is sitting up these days with a coronavirus epidemic that locals increasingly teach him about and say the vast majority of respondents have failed badly, or very badly at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has been disrupted by protests and disruptions that triggered the death of George Floyd.
Trump and his government have failed or failed to do so.
To conquer Trump’s problems, he is now under serious criticism for ordering federal police officers to break back protests in cities where city or government officials are Democrats.
It has created enormous wolves among the populations of the cities, and that anger spreads to other Americans.
The U.S. officials’ photographs of the protestors in unlabeled cars have not helped the U.S. cause.
The Lincoln Project’s announcement was highlighted, but it can be seen below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with very little vote differences.
In fact, Trump won a lot of states with a small vote and won the election with a minority vote.
Michigan, for example, won him with only 10,704 votes.
It is less than 0.5% of the population.
Almost all the opinions that politicians say significant are showing the same conclusion, Biden is taken beyond.
A new survey by CNN in Arizona shows that Biden’s advantage has now emerged from the queue boundaries of the survey.
The same goes for CNN and the University of Quinnipiac.
Even Fox News, who leaned to the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published surveys of the same content in its media.
The president’s last hope, according to the questionnaires, is that Trump might hope to re-establish a follow-up in important places within the swinging states if the attention of the election campaign is directed to the economy.
The U.S.'s economy was severely hit after the Covid-19 epidemic, but voters do not seem to be linking the economic shock to the coronavirus epidemic.
That is, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for having failed to respond to the Crown Viral Age, but still trust him better to deal with the economic shock that the state is experiencing at this time.
However, Trump has failed to lead the debate in the election campaign.
Following the incontinences that have leaped almost continuously since news came from the video alarmingly as four policemen killed George Floyd, Trump attempted to direct the debate over the law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order, became his character.
It seems to have failed completely, as I said before.
As the polls lean more on Trump, more and more Republicans are likely to abandon Trump and declare support for Biden, or someone else, which is then Biden without mentioning him specifically on his name.
This is because the U.S. government has voted in many elections on the same ballot.
Thus, the voter can simply mark the other party in the presidential election section, and make it valid as a vote for all other candidates of that party on the voting section.
Thus, the Republican Party candidates are tempting other offices to get rid of the sluggish relay of Trump and achieve independent success in the elections.
Children's Olympics in Dakar to be postponed to 2026
Youth Olympics were to be held in Dakar next year, but they have now been postponed to 2026 because of the World Olympic Committee and Senegal.
The postponement of the first Olympic Games to take place in Africa, however, is a shock for many young athletes.
Volunteer arrested for fire in Nantes
Volunteer in the Cathedral of Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed the church.
Le Monde has, after the prosecutor, admitted that the suspect, a Rwanda refugee who served as a church supervisor, had burned the fire.
The man’s lawyer says in a conversation with another media that the man greatly sees his actions.
Among those destroyed in the fire was an organ of the 17th century and historically illustrated windows of the church.
The 39-year-old volunteer, who has not been named, was arrested shortly after the fire on 18 July, but was then released.
He was subsequently returned to the police station yesterday and held in custody.
“No way out of this.”
I'm welcomed at Baltasar's and Kristjan Samper's home in Kópavogur.
The occasion for my visit is a new Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, which will be opened on August 1 in the Ladder of Litla-Kambi on Snæfellsnes.
This is the first time the father shows up.
I'm taken down to Baltasar's studio where a magnificent painting blazes with me.
Large and gloomy images of the chicks in the past but also of flying creatures; an eagle on one, shadowing birds on another.
From the living room is out in the courtyard of the house.
“We had a horse here with us that bit the grass,” Baltasar said.
“The horse works much better than a lawn mower on these hills and hills we have.”
Mireya is with us Kristjana and Baltasar and she tells us how her work is about the works that are here.
“Inputs, a combination of paperwork and jewelry sculpture.
“They’re all very white and in contrast to what my dad is doing, where I’m working with the light and so on,” she says.
“It’s been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain works I was working on and would have wanted to show there, but they stuck in Tokyo out of Covid.
When my dad started painting and I saw where he was going, I rethinked my part,” says Mireya, but Baltasar’s work has a strong repercussions in Icelandic legends about female scavengers.
“When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the chicks, I felt ideal to make jewelry related to them,” says Mireya, but the jewelry works with Sigurður Inga Bjarnason’s goldsmith in the store Sign.
“I’ll make a cut out of the jewelry.”
Last year, Mireya attended the exhibition of 72 artists of the Academy’s perception at Snæfellsnes, including in the Ladder of Litle-Kambi and found the building fascinating.
“This is a new space, an old load that’s just made up,” said Mireya, who talked to a artist Baldvinu Sverrisdóttir, who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar set up an exhibition.
“She wanted us both to show up and we thought:
“Why not?
It's a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain and studied at the University of Arts in Barcelona before going on a world trip to study art museums and conduct research.
He joined Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by country and nation.
Here he came back shortly afterwards, met his wife, Kristjana, and has lived here continuously since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a productive artist, has held dozens of private shows, and shows with Kristjana widely.
He is best known for his large wall paintings, including wall decoration in Flateyjar Church and fresco in the Víðstaðastaðakirkja.
“What affects what I do is bitterness that Iceland has and no other place,” Baltasar said.
“These low suns and those shadows that stretch and stretch.
As soon as I came here, I thought, “Wait, here you can work.”
Mireya is the oldest child of Kristjana and Baltasars, born in 1964.
“There was one thing I knew, it was quite clear that I wasn’t going to be a photographer,” she asked if she wanted to follow in the footsteps of her parents.
“I went to high school and did everything I could to get away from this.
And then I realized I was on the run.
“You just have to give up,” Mireya laughs.
She, like her father, has shown around the world.
A lot in Japan, to photograph.
All the children of Baltasar and Kristjan have been walking the art road.
"I call it a virus," said Mireya.
“There was no way out of this.”
Icelandair has been in a grey area when flights were cancelled.
The Minister of Social Affairs believes Icelandair has been in a grey area when the company terminated all airlines in the middle of a kjaradei.
Then he claims that laws that prevent firefighters from entering a residential building will be taken into consideration after the fire at the Bröderstadstorg.
On July 17, Icelandair agreed to cancel all 38 airlines who worked with the company while the airline’s carcass was still on the board of a state fighter.
There were discussions about whether Icelandair had been allowed to take these resignations and was prepared for the case to be resolved for the Social Court.
However, Icelandair and Icelandair had never ended for more than 24 hours after their resignation.
On the other hand, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, the Minister of Social Affairs, said that in his mind Icelandair’s decision was in a grey area and went to the right employee.
“My opinion is that this is a certain right to protect workers.
When you’re in a conversation, when you’re with a contractor, it’s not an option to go this way.
It is clear in my mind that this would not have happened.
I think it’s quite clear, in my mind, that men had come into a grey area there what this touched,” says Ásmundur.
He will not say that other companies go the same way as Icelandair.
“You can also now see a dangerous discussion that it’s just normal to start releasing this system to reduce this right, and that’s why I’m totally opposed.”
On Sprengjan this morning, Ásmund was also asked about the response of the government to the fire at the Bronzeburg Strip at the end of June, where three died.
The Minister says the investigation is now on the board of the Household and Construction Agency, which he directed the recommendations to.
“It’s in the law today that firefighters are not allowed to enter a residential building.
I have asked the Household and Construction Agency to examine specifically if there is a reason to go to some legal changes.
“I’m ready to bring out the legislative changes that need to reduce the likelihood that this can happen again,” says Ásmundur Einar.

United States said increased pressure on entrepreneurs Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
The U.S. government has made further efforts to force European companies to abandon the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, led by Russia, according to Welt am Sonntag, which quotes people who are familiar with the issue.
According to the newspaper, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the U.S. Department of Energy have contacted European entrepreneurs to ensure they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to 12 officials must have held at least two online meetings with the representatives of the companies in the last few days.
Those who witnessed the talks said that the Americans had “friendly” tone emphasized that the United States wanted to prevent Nord Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
“I think this is a very, very serious threat,” one of them said to the German media.
These threats are in line with Mike Pompeo’s statement last week, when he warned that companies involved in the project would be best to “get out now” or risk penalties under 232 parts of the notorious Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy crisis Gazprom, which manages the development of the project, five European companies participate in it.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell as well as Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In an interview with Welt am Sonntag, a representative of the latter company said the US attempts to undermine “important infrastructure project” would be a clear intervention in the sovereignty of European countries.
Earlier this week, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a change to the law of defence designed to extend the U.S. sanctions against companies involved in the installation of the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the forwarders of the bill, the resorts may be directed to companies that pay for or submit ships, insurance, port facilities or connecting services for such ships, as well as those offering certification for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and officials have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of the US's attempts to deal with European energy issues by applying penalties against Nord Stream 2, and some of them have even called for Brussels to work on reversals.
Moscow leaders have also criticized the action from Washington harshly and called it unfair competition.
Last week, President Dmitry Peskov spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would set up a new plan for how the project will be completed if Washington officials hold the new penalties for stress.
Preparing for further transport of government agencies to land
The Minister for Social Affairs and Childcare plans to move more public agencies out of the country in the near future.
The Household and Construction Agency will be moved to the north of the Sauðárkrók in the fall that the Minister’s decision, but experts in the department have previously stated that they do not intend to move north.
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister for Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, said this morning that it was important for the countryside to be transported to public institutions.
There is also a lot of value that creates diversity.
“It’s very important, we’re trying to build everything around the country.
“Working structure, monetary-creating structure, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some natural exploitation and this type of work as a public job, they support very well for that structure,” says Ásmundur.
“Creating increased diversity, creating better support for this resource utilization and the nation’s currency creation.”
The decision of Ásmundur to transport the fire prevention area of the Household and Construction Agency has been heavily criticized by its employees and the National Association of Firefighters and Medical Transporters.
Six people who have expertise in fireworks and work in the department are all residents of the capital area and none of them intends to transfer habitats to the Sauðárkrók.
“I think it’s clear that there are politically different opinions about how hard it should be to do this.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should launch radical actions to better distribute the public jobs,” says Ásmundur.
“We see that our neighbouring nations, the Norwegians and the Danes have been doing this successfully.”
He says that the majority of the nation wants to see more distribution in public institutions around the country.
“I think we need to make further political decisions about the transfer of public jobs to the country, just like I was doing with the Housing and Construction Agency.”
He takes examples of the transportation of Food Agency in Selfoss, Iceland’s surveys to Akraness and unemployment insurance on Skagaströnd.
“There’s a workplace on the Skagaströnd today that matters a lot for that community.
I think we should take further steps in this world.”
“I’m preparing for further steps in this world.
More transportation."
Fifty arrested in Seattle
The U.S. President’s decision to send federal police forces to cities to put down disruptions was widely protested yesterday.
Fifty people were arrested in Seattle.
The Seattle police used blazing bombs and pepper sprays in massive protests yesterday that the police have declared disintegration.
21 police officers were injured and at least 45 protestors were arrested.
Two months later, protests against systematic racism began in the United States after a police officer was killed by George Floyd.
The blast was set to show protestors in Portland unity.
There has been a lot of clashes between police and protestors since the U.S. President sent the forces of U.S. police, who have been driving on unlabeled cars, to the unthankful authorities.
Thousands came together in Portland this weekend, using police tears and rubbers when they were struck in a hurry between them and protestors.
He had a miracle child 47 years old.
Kenya Moore, an American real-life star, is well-to-do by empowering people in need of tech fertilization.
Moore, who is known for his role in The Real Housewives of Atlanta, had her first child 47 years after tech fertilization and calls her daughter a miracle child.
“I almost waited my whole life to have a baby,” Moore said in an interview with People.
“So I know the anxiety that people feel, especially women, to think that I could possibly not have a baby.”
Moore realized that she was running out at a time when she became 40.
“I didn’t want to have a child alone.
I didn’t want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after 40 years, I looked up and thought my god good,” said Moore, who never met her grandfather until she was 46 years old.
A year later, they had a daughter.
The real-life star says her daughter is a miraculous child in more than one way.
In addition, Moore was older than most of the originals, her daughter came to the world one and a half months before the set day.
Moore went to an emperor's cutting which proved to be difficult and took much longer than a traditional emperor's cutting.
“I call her the miracle babe because it was a child that everyone said was almost no chance for me to have,” Moore said.

Doctor ran 35 miles with a mask
The British doctor Tom Lawton ran 35 miles with a facial mask to show that oxygen saturation did not decrease when using facial masks.
Lawton is a doctor at the Bradford Royal Hospital and has worked there during the World Cup.
In order to dismiss the theory of oxygen saturation and to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run to work and back with a mask.
Before leaving, he founded a collection of GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust, which handles food supplies in Bradford and across Britain.
“I am a great supporter of everything that keeps us safe.
That’s why I’ve been shocked by the wrong information that has passed people between that face masks reduce the oxygen saturation in people,” Lawton said.
Lawton said he had previously competed in a three-round race, but during the World War, he had been able to endure.
On Monday, he ran 35 miles.
“I never took off the mask (no food or drink) and the oxygen saturation persisted 98% every time I looked,” Lawton tweeted.
Prince Joachim is still in hospital.
Prince Joachim of Denmark is now located at the University Hospital in Toulouse, France, and is his condition constantly.
The prince went through a brain surgery yesterday after diagnosing blood clots.
"Prince Joachim's condition is still constant.
The prince came into the hands of professionals in a timely manner and feels good after events.
It’s too early to tell him how long he’s staying at the hospital at this moment,” says Lene Balleby, an intelligence officer in the Danish Royal Palace, in a written reply to the Danish state radio.
Only a few days have passed since the royal family celebrated the 18th anniversary of Prince Felix, the son of Joachim, his second-oldest son.
It was celebrated at the Queen's vineyard, Château de Cayx, in Cahors, southern France.
The family was still on vacation when Joakim was admitted to the hospital yesterday.
Joakim, 51 years old, moved to France last year, where he is studying at the Ecolé Militaire, the first Dana.
Then he works as a defense expert at the Danish Embassy in Paris.
His father's name is Prince Henry, French, and his wife, Princess Mary, as well.

An Aviation Accident in Utah: Children and two adults died in a crash in the backyard
Six people were on board a Piper PA-32 plane that crashed into a backyard in West Jordan on Saturday, according to Allen Kenitzer, spokesman for the FAA.
Three of those on board were killed, including 43-year-old pilot Lee Wyckoff, his 9-month-old child and Milda Shibonis, 36-year-old police officer in West Jordan.

Three houses were also damaged, according to Tauni Barker, a spokesman for West Jordan.
We haven't found out the cause of the breakaway.
The case is being investigated by the U.S. Air Administration and the National Transportation Agency (NTSB).
Gottlieb warns that the irreversible spread of the coronavirus in society makes it “very difficult” that schools open in the fall
Washington - Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, warned Sunday that it would be “very difficult” for school districts to open up a new year of study if the coronavirus spreads smoothly within these communities.
“I think the school authorities need every place to examine how the distribution is within the community.
If the virus spreads unobtrusively in the community, it will be very difficult to open in that condition,” Gottlieb said in “Face the Nation.”
Since the autumn tooth starts in the next few weeks, the Trump government had encouraged the school authorities to open up their schools to students and offer tuition in schools five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and Minister of Education Betsy DeVos come a week after Trump warned that the coronavirus epidemic would probably “deteriorate before he recovers” and confirmed that school districts in the places where the situation is worst may have to delay the opening of schools for a few weeks.
However, on Thursday, medical centers issued instructions on how safely it would be to open a school for students.
In the instructions, the schools call for a distance between people to be guaranteed, students and staff to be advised to use face defenses and that students are divided into limited groups to reduce infectious pathways.
But the disease defense centers did not issue the criteria for school managers about when to close schools if the coronavirus infection is increasing, which Gottlieb says has been “unpleasant.”
“When this uncertainty exists and detailed guidance has not been given about how the schools will be opened, I think more parents will be careful,” he said.
“That’s why I think it’s very important to get accurate information about what the measurements are exactly, which the disease defense centers did not provide in their instructions.”
Gottlieb said school districts must think about the ratio of positive infections in the community, local spread and test capacity when making decisions about whether to keep schools open or to switch all over to online teaching.
If between 5 and 10% of the analysis delivers a positive result, “the issue is going to be more difficult” than over 10%, “the threshold when considering carefully whether to close the school districts.”
“This is a sign that the epidemic has reached a foothold in the community,” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make parts of the Florida, which is the centre of the Crown Viral Psychology in the United States, difficult to open for schools next month.
The number of coronary viruses has increased to more than 30 states and Colombia, but the centre of the epidemic is currently in the southern shore of the United States.
Gottlieb said, however, that there were signs that it had begun to slow down the number of cases in some states, including Arizona and Texas.
But even though Gottlieb had said that there were "different signs" that it had begun to slow down the epidemic in some states in the sun-belt, the "heating in the coals" of others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indiana and Illinois.
Many governors have set rules that obligated people to use masks in public spaces and stopped the phase of re-opening to block the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that states should consider closing bars, restricting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas and other places that offer in-house entertainment and setting rules for mask use to overcome the epidemic, which are actions that allow states to avoid re-taking the strict restrictions set at the beginning of the epidemic in March.
In addition to the fact that a number of countries have made mask use a duty, a number of companies have forced people to use face defenses.
McDonald's is the newest company to use the face defenses to commit and add it to a group of companies like Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules for mask use.
Gottlieb said that he assumed that more companies would take up a mask obligation with him, especially since the danger is considered high.
“If we can really control the epidemic when winter goes into existence until we get a vaccine or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease, we can do it with masks, that’s relatively simple, something we can all do but that doesn’t directly change our lives and allows us to keep what’s very important to us, like keeping some companies open and bringing the kids back to school.”
Although Donald Trump said last week he did not want to make mask use a duty throughout the country, he urged Americans last week to use face defenses and said at the White House press conference that “they would have an impact.”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: “It’s time to expect.”
The fans of Crystal Palace received a penalty for the summer when Roy Hodgson, the director of the company, declared that the prosecutor Francis Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the club.
The elephant has been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years and seems to be leaving, but he has previously been spoken to a team like Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, he will find out whether a team in that quality class is still willing to pay high sums for him, especially during the financial uncertainties of the sport this summer, after a period where Zaha scored four goals and made five supports for the Palace team that caused some disappointments.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that “the time would be expected” regarding Zaha’s possible departure after confirming that the sóknarman had “recognised” that he sees his future elsewhere than at the club.
There are still three years left by the parisher's contract at Palace, and last year the company indicated that 100 million Sterling Pounds would need the company to beat him off.
Hodgson finished the season with seven consecutive losses and a draw on the last day of the season, which resulted in the team falling to 14th place.
Zaha found a net mesh only once from mid-December to the end of the season with a long shot in a loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for sales last summer when he tried to get rid of the club but no offer was reached to tempt the Palace to sell.
Zaha exchanged an agent in January, for it seems to increase the chances of reaching out of the club, and in the next few weeks it will undoubtedly be a priority for him to secure a social change.
Zaha is the player who played most of the minutes in the English Premier League for Palace during the season and was the only player of the team under the age of 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, demonstrating how much reconstruction of the team could be necessary to launch with the funds gained for the player.
The orkan Hanna: The coronary Texas state faces a high risk of disasters in a “double shell”
Weather reporters have predicted "hacker floods" in southern Texas after the orchestra Hanna reached twice the country, resulting in heavy rains and winds up to 40 meters per second.
When he reached a beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first-stage storm (the lowest level of five-stage scale), and he has now been brought down to a tropical storm, but rain could still be 150-300 mm on Sunday and wind could reach 26 meters in seconds.
In some areas, rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including in Cameron County, on the border of Mexico.
Hanna was the first orbital storm in the Atlantic in 2020, and the weather scientist Chris Birchfield advised the residents to be well on duty: “This is not close to the end yet. We still expect disasters.”
For the past few weeks, Texas has faced a massive increase in coronaviruses.
The governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster announcement for 23 counties on the way of the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston and Brazoria.
“Every orchestra is a huge challenge.
This challenge is complicated and even harder as the orchestra passes through a region that has become what’s been the worst out because of COVID-19,” Greg said.
The orchestra first landed at 17:00 on Saturday, 24 kilometres north of Port Mansfield, about 210 kilometres south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far away, in the east of Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
Emergency services in Corpus Christi set up gardens near the intersections in order to be able to use them if the flow is far above the streets.
U.S. President Donald Trump said the government was monitoring Hannah and the orthodox Douglas, who headed towards Havai in the Pacific Ocean.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the beach in Corpus Christi, said that the storm approaching had increased the anxiety that she felt as a result of the World Cup.
This 67-year-old woman had mostly stayed at home due to health problems associated with chronic pulmonary disease.
She said, “It’s almost like a double plague for us.
I think a lot of people are insensitive.
We'll get through this.
“Everybody is good and strong and stands together.”
Sightseeing in the South
The southern part of the country has gone very well this summer, but the weather has been good for farmers.
Most of them have first shots, the second beat is widely started, and some are expected to reach the third beat at the end of the summer.
The weather has played with southern farmers like the other inhabitants of the region this summer and does not spoil the bounty on the barrel of the peasants.
Heyness has worked well.
Sigurður Ágústsson, a cow farmer in Birtingaholt in Hrunamannahreppur and a developer in heyheit is happy and happy.
"Yes, it's just been great, I think farmers just have to be steep, it's been fine, it's been a very good weather for the past half a month.
The harvest is very good and the quality of the harvest is fine,” says Sigurdur.
Sigurður says that it is moving in growth, not least with the cow peasants that they shout in flat pits or outdoors, which has been very well given, but it is long to do in the rolling hoard.
“It’s lively, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable right now for the past half a month or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good and it’s so comfortable to deal with this.
It remembers everything, there is less stress and can be stored until the morning sometimes what could be done today, so it is brilliant comfortable.
Do you think that any farmer will beat three times?
“Yes, I could believe that, those who were the first.
We started on June 17th, it may be that those who were the first would have to take three times.”
Preliminary solution in the wolves - How to Prevent Injuries
Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English League, is a hugely fast player.
His opponents have had it to grab him to make sure he doesn’t get past them.
This has caused his shoulder to fall out several times, but now the wolves have come up with a solution to the problem.
The Sun tells us about it.
In the game of Wolves against Crystal Palace, the ambulances could see an ointment on the shoulders of Traoré.
“This is something we had to do to protect Traoré,” said Wolves.
“By making him a sleeve, the defenders make it harder to catch him, and so we can prevent further injuries.”
His shoulder Traoré first dropped out of team when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has gone out of the team four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Prince Harry of England: The friend of the Duke of Sussex protests statements in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott told Sky News that the contents of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were no different from the content of the gossip magazines, the only difference was that the book was enclosed.
The former soldier wants the view to be increasingly directed to the positive things that the couple has contributed, such as their charity.
Stott said, “I feel what appears there in nothing different from what we read in the gossip magazines, except now only in the enclosed book.”
“There’s a storyteller who tells us, but there’s no doubt that this has come from them.”
“I think it’s just another attack on them, just like the gossip magazines that persecute them.”
“I realize they are in the spotlight and people want to know what they are doing, but I wish there was more to discuss all the good things they have done and their charity, rather than their personal affairs.”
“They never get out of it, for their sake.”
The support of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex overlooked the other members of the royal family, according to an expert in the history of the royal family.
Doctor Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had failed to take advantage of Harry Prince's and Meghan Markle's prosperity.
She added that the government of the royal family was established, but that it could not be directed by the public interest.
She also said: “The fact is that all they did in support of the Queen tended to overlook other members of the royal family, and this was considered a problem.”
“They are very popular.”
“They had less weddings than most of the siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a giant wedding.”
“But though Harry and Meghan’s wedding was smaller in shape than with William and Katrine, the news was just as much, due to the great interest of the world in the couple.”
Donald Trump admits he often sees his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often notices his posts on Twitter that promotes warfare.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, U.S. President said his uninterested re-release on Twitter records — some of which have contained content from the white racialists — would get him into the most trouble.
When Dave Portnoy asked if he could see his posts, Trump replied: “Oftely, too often.
It was so in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very big.
You put it on your desk and then you came back the next day and said, "Oh, I'm glad I didn't send it," right?
We don’t do it with Twitter.
We send it out right away, we feel great, and then you start getting a call, “Did you really say this?”
I say, “What’s going on?” and you’ll find out.”
Last month, Trump caused great anger after releasing a record (divided content from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages region of Florida where an elderly couple called “White Power!” or “White Power.”
And in 2017, Trump re-established three posts directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, the leader of the right-wing party Britain First.
The president told Portnoy that the republics that had made him the most troubled
Trump said, “You see something that looks good and doesn’t investigate it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what’s on the helmet, which’s a little small and you don’t expand it, sometimes — I’ve found that there’s almost always the rebirth that brings you into trouble.”
The president often shares praise to himself, voices about his opponents and conspiracy teachings with his 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him get through the so-called “false news” on television and newspapers, which he says is overwhelmed by falsehood.
But the president’s lies have often fallen under the microscope, and now Twitter means Trump’s records as misleading.
GPS may be insecure.
Many countries work to develop different location technologies than the GPS system.
Engineering educator says that there may be reason to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is owned by the US Army.
The old Loran system has been renewed.
The GPS comes with every foot.
We use it when we fly, sail and drive, we survey, in industry and leisure.
Most people think that she is a military instrument owned by the United States Army, which opened it for general use in the nineties of the last century.
The GPS uses coordinates from a satellite at an altitude of 20,000 kilometers above the ground, and therefore conditions in nature have little impact on it.
“It’s very easy to disrupt her.
And malicious people can easily disrupt the reception of these marks,” says Sæmundur E. Þorsteinsson, a lecturer in engineering at the University of Iceland and an expert on risk management and telecommunications security.
He also says easy to send error signals with the wrong location, for example in warfare.
“The GPS system is owned by the U.S. Department of Defense.
They have assured the public that the system is available at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it pushes into the head of a very specific president to do so, he could probably do it,” Sæmundur said.
So many countries are beginning to think about other systems and location techniques.
Both the Russians and the Chinese operate their own satellite system, and the European Union is launching the Galileo location system.
“The Galilee system is primarily built for civilian use.
It may have more precision and is naturally governed by the European Union.
“There is not one government that rules it completely, but many,” Sæmundur said.
However, many people are also looking back at the old technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the 1960s until the GPS took over.
The Lóran signals are sent on very long waves from sent down the Earth.
“There’s a new version of the Loran system, which stands for Enhanced Loran, people are seriously looking at it in many countries to have it as a system for product, because it’s a little bit different from the law to disrupt it, it’s much harder than disrupting satellite systems,” Sæmundur says.
However, it is probably the safest to have access to most location systems.
Senator Vern Buchanan's Experienced Employee Died by the Crown Virus
“Gary was a professional in the fingertips and a loyal servant of the public,” Buchanan said on Facebook.
“He touched the lives of so many and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how excited he was, the sense of humor and the unique joy he received from helping others.”
Buchanans' office published a statement earlier this month stating that Tibbetts had not had any recent communications with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
Florida has reported 414.511 cases since the beginning of the World Cup, which is more than the 411.200 cases in New York, according to the health authorities in the states.
Data from the state’s health authorities show that hospitalisation has increased by 79% since the National Day of the United States, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 intensive care teams in Florida reached the thresholds on Saturday.
“We were told that this could have an impact,” DeSantis said in June.
“At the same time, police work and putting penalties on this could have an opposite effect.”
Flight from Hornafjörður to Cape Town
Turk doves, rosestars, ring doves, alternates, glitters and greeds are among the birds that have fled to this country this summer.
On the website of the Bird Survey Centers of Southeastern Birds.is you can almost daily see brief news about the flickers, where they have been seen, and sometimes their breeds.
There are many birds in Iceland.
This includes the number of people who like the Facebook page Icelandic bird species.
The group's members are around 14,600.
There are pictures of birds shared and obvious that Iceland is rich in good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
My son is one of them.
Binni, as he is called, is an employee of the Bird Survey Centre of Southeastern and Southeastern Nature Agency, and closely monitors the birdlife in that area.
He talks beautifully about these animals that enrich the livery in Iceland and play an important role in it, and it doesn’t matter if the bird is a big and big roving bird or a small sparrow.
The Bird Observatory was founded in 2005 on the birthday of Hálfdán Björnsson at Kvískerjum in Örævar, with the aim of holding air and continuing the significant natural research that he conducted since 1940.
“Halfdán was thirteen years old when he began to deal with information about birds,” Brynjulf said in a conversation with Kjernan.
“We at the bird inspection center are not doing exactly the same thing as Hálfdán did, but we are building on top of his data by counting and marking birds.”
Half-dán was a farmer and public scientist, born on 14 March 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles on plants, insects and birdlife.
He died on February 10, 2017, almost nine years old.
Half-dán and his siblings in Kvískerker were interested in many people who met them in Icelandic nature.
In that group is Björn Gísli Arnarson, the “her employee” of the Bird Survey Centre.
Björn grew up at Reynivellir in the Southern Division and received a rich natural pestilence with his neighbor, Hálfdáni in Kvískerjum.
But what exactly does the bird industry do?
Each year, on 20 March, the Bird Survey Station sets up a special bird network in Einarsluðar, a wooden cane near the Hornafjörður.
There are standard markings on the birds that come in the nets.
The network is closed around May 10th, when the warp time begins.
The internet is up every day, at least from about 6 o'clock in the morning until noon.
And they have to visit every hour.
The birds in them are marked, measured and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a journalist asks.
“Yes, we’re sharing this with you and me.
Since we now have to work for ourselves, this can be a significant puzzle, but somehow we can do it,” Brynjulf says.
The internet is re-installed from 1 August to 10 November — every day the weather permits.
Between monitoring the nets and during the periods they are not up, Brynjulf and Björn are marking the creases, foams and various moths where they reach them.
In addition, they take on a variety of special tasks.
One of these projects is collaborating with the National Institute of Natural Sciences in Iceland and is about collecting birds.
“The birds are trapped on their winter stations and then taken to the land in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, and therefore these birds aren’t big when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find someone else's host when he needs it."
But enough about the birds.
Asked about how the birds in Southeastern Iceland have it this summer, Brynjulf says that the lip of the crie seems to work well — where it over the head a lip.
“The end of the war here is at Hala in the South and everything is going well.
“But there is no warp to be found anymore at Jökulsárlón, as there was a huge warp a few years ago.”
A few years ago, he said that there were over a thousand pairs of creeps, but they can now be counted on the fingers of another hand.
“When we look at moor and waddle birds, I feel it has decreased in recent years what you feel about them.
But there is always a change between years.”
What can explain this great change is probably about the supply of food.
“It’s all about food.”
Humans can also have their own work to say about the birds and other animals.
But some birds seem to have a lot of fun in Southeastern Europe this summer.
“One of the things I think positive is that the puppy is growing again after a great decline,” Brynjulf says, “but in the meantime, the skirt has been devastating over the last few years and decades.”
It seems to me that this summer, like last year, is going to be a good summer.
Forest thrusts and duvetitting had declined somewhat, but Brynjulf says it won’t reveal until this fall how this summer proved to them.
But let's turn to the lumps.
Often they draw a lot of attention, especially if they are very clever and even colorful.
These two interesting episodes include one of the most popular in the summer: the Rose Star.
"Otherwise, it has been relatively quiet in the summer in the flicks," says Brynjulf, but mentions that in the countryside is now finding a gray tree and then the ring doves have been seen and are beginning to plunge here.
When Brynjulfur and Björn get to the toes, they also mark them, just like other birds.
Signs are international and are practiced all over the world.
The meanings include the birds’ winter centres, where they go, and what their paths are.
“It’s even possible to see how long they’re flying,” Brynjulf points out.
This information is useful in many ways, to form when it comes to epidemics such as bird elephants.
“It’s always increasing knowledge.”
If anyone in the world finds a bird marked by the bird survey centre in Southeastern Iceland, the information is sent to the Icelandic Institute of Natural Sciences.
“We’ve got everything back from Cape Town in South Africa.
There was a book that we had labeled.
“One of us was found in the United States later.”
One bird is the bird, and it is the bird.
“The shoe is our bird,” he says, pointing out that the Bird Survey Center and the Southeastern Nature Institute have the task of tracking his performance — which has become a rather slower and now he is on the road.
It is difficult to assert what caused a fall in the stem, but one theory is that the foam made a seafood that was previously thrown off by fishing boats and into the sea, but that it is now being used much better and it affects the foam.
Are you in the best place to watch birds?
“You naturally don’t get me to say no,” Brynjulf laughs, adding: “Since we’re also chasing birds, we probably need to go beyond.”
But the South East is certainly special when it comes to birdlife.
“This area is like drawn into the land from Europe, but then the birds spread from here.
Being here to explore birds and birds is very interesting, but there are less to find of birds than elsewhere in the country.
It’s not far from the beach and to the glacier, so the area as such is suitable for observation of birds.”
Do you have a favorite bird?
He thinks about it for a while before he answers.
The question is difficult.
“The town is my bird, but I have found nine of the ten that have been seen in the land,” he said.
“I think it’s a lot more fun to take pictures of horses.
So it’s always fun to find birds that have not been seen before in this country or are rare, so I’m not talking about finding a new species for Europe.”
But they both do.
If you want to keep a better track of the work of Binna and Björssa at the Bird Survey Centre in Southeastern Norway, you can follow their work on Facebook and on Fuglar.is.
Saudi Arabia - Sun Beach of the Future? No Alcohol or Bikini
The tourism industry has grown enormously wide throughout the world in recent years and now the Saudi authorities want their cut off the cake.
It is expected that the government will spend around 60,000 billion Icelandic kroner to create a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian explains this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that Icelanders should get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available and women will not be allowed to sunbath themselves in bikinium.
But how do you get the travellers to this Islamic country?
For example, it should be done by building a new city where white beaches, moons (evidently created by humans), drone taxis and robots serve people.
The Guardian says it is Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will be spent in the oil industry.
The Crown Prince says that there is no debate that women can let go of covering shoulders and knees in public places, but admits that it is not easy to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot when the sun is high in the air and can not be relied on wind cooling.
However, you may also be wondering if you can’t buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, former President of the Central African Republic, announces a presidential offer
On Saturday, former President of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, announced that he would offer himself in the December presidential elections despite the United Nations taking him offensive action and the arrest warrant issued due to his alleged crimes against humanity.
He announced his availability in a speech in front of a large group of supporters of his party, Kwa na Kwa (“work, only work”), in the capital of Bangui.
This 73-year-old former military commander and commander was deprived in 2013 by the revolt of the Alliance, mostly Muslim rebels from the north who overthrowed the nation, mostly to Christians, in violent civil wars and serious and long-lasting humanitarian crisis.
“The country needs a man with experience, peace and conviction,” Bozize said in a speech critical of the term of office of the current President, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took power after a coup d'état in 2003 and served as president for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against humanity and for encouraging genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile in late last year.
It is not clear how the arrest warrant or foreign penalties affect his availability.
In January, Bozize said he would ask the United Nations to eliminate the sanctions imposed in 2014 due to alleged support for the armed Christian groups of Anti-balaka.
Touadera runs the country today with the support of the comprehensive UN peacekeeping, which includes more than 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to be offered for a different term, but his availability has not been confirmed.
The first round of the elections will be on December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace treaty with 14 armed groups that generally claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crimes have declined, but still arise bloody incidents that are most often caused by conflicts over resources, but the majority of this diamond-rich country is not under the control of the government.
The violence has consumed more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Gareth Bale’s position at Real Madrid is “unacceptable for everyone” says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, Real Madrid’s midfielder, said Gareth Bale’s position was “unacceptable for everyone.”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team, and he took little part in the LaLiga celebration of Los Blancos, and this summer the patt stand has come up that the player intends to stay behind and let his contract run out, but the club hopes he will disappear.
“There’s no way to avoid the situation becoming unacceptable for everyone,” Kroos said on the Lauschangriff Endlich was my Sport.
"He wasn't buying to play him as little as it is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the club last summer and that the club actually said “yes” but so said “no” later.
I don't know if he's still a bit angry because of that.
When he was asked if the circumstances had negatively affected Real’s atmosphere, Kroos said: “Not as much as expected.
I've known him for six years and we've worked a lot of important things together."
The Chinese give the City of Reykjanes 2,000 face masks to support the fight against the Crown Virus
The Chinese ambassador, Jin Zhijian, delivered two thousand face masks to the Mayor of Reykjanes in the past week.
The event was the Mayor’s visit to the Chinese Embassy on 22 July.
News first reported.
The occasion of the mayor’s visit was to reimburse the visit of the Chinese ambassador in Reykjanes, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
It is said that there has been a discussion of the promotion of friendships between Reykjanesborg and Xianyang city, but the municipalities began their cooperation between 2014.
The presenter, 2,000 face masks, is rooted in this friendly city partnership, but the city authorities in Xianyang wanted to give masks and thus support the fight against the Crown Viral Pandemic.
According to the news, the masks will be used in sensitive institutions and establishments in Reykjanesbær for both employees and other visitors who come there.
In the accompanying picture, you can see the flag of Iceland and the People's Republic of China, the inscription of the face mask box, which says, "Ber is who behind, unless a brother does not see."
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculates to drop in wages
Tobias Thomsen is trying to get back to Denmark, from the Icelandic Champions KR, next month, and says he is interested in the club of the Danish First Division.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and has become an Iceland Champion with both Val and KR.
This 27-year-old striker, however, says he is beginning to miss Denmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania Jakobsdóttir.
The agreement with KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish company would have to negotiate with KR for a purchase price to get it in August, before a new season begins in Denmark.
If not, Thomsen would have to wait until this winter to get to Denmark.
“Yes, I know the Danish divisions will start again in late August.
That means, of course, that I have to cancel my contract with KR-inga but I have told them that I miss Denmark, and they have a full understanding of it,” Thomsen told bold.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with Rúnar Kristinsson coach, who would have shown the position full understanding, and Thomsen said he did not think that the purchase price would be a big problem.
“I’ve also had conversations with two 1st department companies after the department was finished and the teams knew where they would end.
“There has already been a little interest in the coming season, so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic Division quits,” Thomsen said, adding that it was clear that there were not many companies in Denmark who could buy up his contract with KR.
“It’s not clear now, but it’s been an interest.
I also need to find the best option for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
It depends on a few things," Thomsen said, and said he looked first and foremost to Copenhagen.
Thomsen said KR-inga doesn’t have to worry that he won’t be all in the exercises and games, even though he missed Denmark.
“I know what it gets from me, and that’s how I do it 100 percent.
“I can completely overlook the fact that I miss Denmark when I’m on exercises or in games,” said Thomsen, who clearly says he’s going to drop his salary by leaving the Iceland Champions in the second division of Denmark.
“I’ll probably have to drop only in wages, because of the crown virus crisis that seems to have hit the Danish companies a little more than the Icelandic ones.
But I’m also studying, and one solution could be that a company provided me a job.
Most of the companies in the 1st Division have an agreement with the sponsors.
I’m learning sports management through the player organization and I’m finishing the bachelor’s degree,” Thomsen said.
Thomsen has only been in the starting team of KR in two games in the Pepsi Max League during this season, but has made a story in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games last year and scored seven goals.
KR is an equal selection to the peak of the Pepsi Max League and a game for good, but the team will meet KA at Akureyri today.
Taking care of the crown virus on board a bus is a driver experiencing a hot argument about face masks
The video shows passengers and drivers on board the Arriva bus in Liverpool handled mask use.
The driver is heard explaining to a woman that it is not in his working circle to tell passengers to use a mask.
The driver said, “It’s not in my working circle to tell everyone who steps up in the cart to wear a mask.”
A witness said this about the incident: “A man and an older woman began to be given to her, and a lot of controversy broke out.”
“The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was going on, and he told one woman that she wasn’t even wearing the mask right.”
“The woman then ran out of the car and said she was going to report the incident.”
Arriva’s spokesman said: “Our clients and our employees are at our forefront.
“Our customers are also obliged to wear masks when they use public transport (exceptions apply).”
“Instructions and labels for customers regarding this and all other distance rules are on board buses, on social media and on our website.”
The law has been in force in public transport since June 15.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been identified worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus worldwide.
Most cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to hire people with disabilities more often
The actress is involved in a new effort to increase the participation of people with disabilities in the entertainment sector.
The action is ongoing at the same time and 30 years have passed since the US law on the rights of people with disabilities, which occurs on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer discusses the importance that people see themselves and their lives reflected in a real way on the screen.
“Nothing can replace personal experiences and genuine manifestations,” she says.
“That’s why it’s so important to hire an appropriate actor.”
Spencer talked about the impact she had on the screen when she was a little girl watching the show Good Times.
The CBS shows were created by Norman Lear from 1974 to 1979, and they marked the way as the first comics to show two parents of African origin.
Confederation against hunger push Yoho aside after incidents in the House of Representatives
WASHINGTON (AP) - Independent Christian organizations who want to end hunger said on Saturday that they had waited Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the government, and that he had dealt with it, as they called "attack" on Senator Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, Senator of the New York Democrats, accused Yoho, Senator of the Republican Republic of Florida, of using a low-cut and masculine crash when he retaliated on the steps of the House last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the word had been as she described it.
Bread for the World said in a statement that the government of the organization had met Yoho on Friday and sought to resign to “justify our commitment to stand with women and males, domestically and globally, leading us towards the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice.”
On Bread for the World’s website, their “co-Christian voice” pushed the parliament and government to end hunger in the country and globally.
“Since Bread for the World is independent of Christian organizations that aim to reduce hunger and poverty with trusted public policies, the organization holds the respect, dignity and care that Jesus asks us to show when we interact with people in power places, wherever it is on the political spectrum,” the statement said.
“Our opinion reflects recent actions and words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, not the moral requirements made to our board members.”
During the processing of the news, Yoho spokesman had not responded to an e-mail with an invitation to respond.
In an incredible speech at the House of Representatives last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez dramatically recounted the incident and directed her words against what she called a male supremacy that “accepts violence and a violent reputation against women.”
More than a dozen of her colleagues acknowledged that the incident was an example of all too common men’s behavior.
Yoho described the incident as a brief debate on policy and that "no one had been bothered, mocked, or attacked."
He said he regretted the “strongness.”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in her first season as a progressive senator and she has received both praise and load for her cleanliness.
The 65-year-old Yoho is one of the most conservative Senators of the House of Representatives and will settle in the holy stone at the end of his fourth term.
Wait until the 98th minute in the local by scoring the first goal of the season
Jesse Lingard had not scored or scored in the English Premier League in this season until he scored against Leicester today in the 98th minute of the final round of the league.
Lingard had not scored in the English Premier League since he scored twice against Cardiff in December 2018.
He joined Manchester United when the team met Leicester in the Champions League final.
When seven minutes were passed over the usual playtime, Lingard hit the ball by Kasper Schmeichel goalkeeper Leicester and scored to the empty goal.
A long line with Jesse Lingard.
Players of Real Madrid exempted rules of eligibility
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples at Real Madrid will be able to come to England in their second game at Manchester City, in the European Champions League, without having to go to a two-week hospital.
The British government has decided that tourists from Spain will have to go for a two-week sickness, to affirm the spread of the crown virus.
However, there are exceptions, as in the case of competition teams at the highest level of sports.
This confirmed the Ministry of Sports with Sky Sports.
The Ministry says that individuals who are exempted from the rules will only be in limited areas, at the smell of the door.
This applies to sports stars, judges, coaches, medical teams and media people.
Madridians can meet Manchester City on August 7 without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2-1 under in the duel after losing to Santiago Bernabeu on February 26.
The team continues to play 8th in Portugal.
Climbing and overhauling the country for the shopping sanctuary
From the news of overwhelmed hotels and campsites to judge, at least south, it is clear that Icelanders have been able to travel domestically this summer.
Those who have landed have also been fortunate with weather and weather conditions DV on one matter that the summer has just been cleanly said beautiful, so far to at least.
But now it’s a shopping weekend that’s been the biggest travel weekend of the year.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared to other weekends, now it is apparent that events that in the usual year have drawn a large number of people not to be held.
I think it’s enough to mention a national holiday as an example.
The weather will, of course, play a major role, but now it is looking for a rainfall throughout the country, but especially south and southwest.
The weather station predicts rainfall from Thursday night and at least until Saturday night.
It should be noted that long-term prophecies are not sacred truth here in the North Atlantic and can certainly take change.
The meteorologist kná Einar Sveinbjörnsson says in his prediction on his weather web, Bliku, that the sanctuary of shoppers is expected to be lower.
He says: Lower temperatures in the high-lofts with associated colds that often also reaches the surface, resulting in the fact that when warmer air from the southwest tries to approach, it is just reduced by wind and precipitation.
It’s also a warmer air that hits the north.
Einar publishes his prediction map in support of it, saying, “A little wave from the Americas fights to the east and brings it a summer-happy air.
As she approaches, she "blooms" in the form of decreasing air pressure and reputable summertime."
The large prediction model, the European Calculator Center on the left of the map and the US GFS prediction on the right are pretty coherent with this development.
The prognosis of the lower level will take place late on Thursday and early on Friday with a sharp A-way and rain on most of the whole country.
The 985 hPa is then included.
This time there is some warm air in the North and East on Saturday and even Sunday as well.
However, it could blow up.
One person seriously injured is a car with cattle selected in Wexford
One was seriously injured in a traffic accident earlier today at the Ferrycarrig Bridge in Wexford.
A car on the bridge ran over to a manless stationary car.
The 34-year-old driver suffered serious injuries in the accident, which occurred around 13:50 today.
He was taken to the hospital in Wexford where he lies heavily held.
The police department is investigating the platform and the bridge has been closed and the convictions emerged.
Lots of cattle were killed in the crash.
The police urge all who travelled the road from 13:45 to 14:00, as well as others who were in the area and might have witnessed the incident, to contact the Wexford Police Station by phone 053 916 5200, the police confidential telephone at 1800 666 111 or another police station.
Actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
“I was shot in her as one gets such a youth shot,” says Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir about Marisku Hargitay, the main actress of the show Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so fond of the actress that she came to the stage and waited for her hours together, just to be able to say hello.
When Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir, the owner of the travel agency Pink Iceland, looked like many Icelanders on the voltage show Law and Order: Special Victims Unit up from the turn of the century, she coaled for the main actress of the show Marisku Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her and her actress in the show Love Stories at Rás 1.
When Birna was a teenager herself, at the age many begin to develop with a violent affection, she did not experience it as her peers because she was struggling to suppress her own teachings.
She seemed to be interested in boy bands and young miserable heart crushes from movies but didn’t have it at all.
“I was cutting out pop newspapers and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian.”
She says that when people come out of the closet, they go through a late-ready barbecue.
“We spend our teenage years suppressing these teenage impulses, these shots and so on.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her,” says Birna about the actress.
“There was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm and I was just shot in her shoes.”
It ran on the lap of the actress when she was in New York a few years ago.
One of her best friends, Erling Óttar Thoroddsen, was shooting a film in the city and gave Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga Guðjónsson, to help with the films.
“We were working in 30 people and spending some time with strangers.
It’s a naturally intimate atmosphere when you spend so long together a day so it was talked about everything and nothing.”
One day, it’s said that Birna is a great fan of Marisku.
One woman in the team tells her friend to recognize the actress because he was in the team.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and asks her new friend regularly how her friends like to work with the actress and whether Birna can get to meet her.
“She tells me to stop this, she doesn’t know if she can let it happen,” Birna says.
When the film is finally finished, the group and Birna try to convince the woman to try to get the meeting around.
“She had a few glasses and said she would just grab it.”
A few days later, Birna sends a message to the woman and asks if something is going on.
The woman does not answer and Birna decides to give up.
One morning she wakes up with a message.
“I look at my phone and scream.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up at the ashes and I say, "I have to take a shower and I have to make myself fine and go down to town."
The woman had written to Birna that her friend, actors and team Law and Order were located at a hotel at Times Square.
“I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, good luck,” says the message, and Birna dresses up quickly. She asks in the reception where the marks are going and takes the lift up to the 45th floor where the group has come together.
Birna arrives and waits until a woman in the staff comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if they can help.
"I say I'm looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland was here."
When the friend finally arrives, he looks astonished at Birna and asks how in the hell she got all the way to the seat, because it was supposed to be a strict security guard.
Birna explains that she just took the elevator and asks to meet Marisku.
“Yes, I don’t know.
“Let’s sit here,” said the friend and the bearer.
She’s on the show and they start chatting.
“I said to him, ‘I am a fan, but you?’”
“I played it as if it was the most natural thing in the world.”
Time passes and the bears are waiting.
The actors appear regularly when a break is made, they get a snack and Birna looks around and searches for Marisku, which is nowhere visible.
Finally, my friend comes and tells her he’s gone.
Birna asks him to get his hands on another employee, but he did not want her to go anywhere immediately.
My friend accepts it and reaches another employee.
“He comes with his other friend and says, ‘This is the woman from Iceland who wants to meet Marisku.’”
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours, the new friend will be running to Birna.
“He says, fast.
These are unusual situations today, there are journalists with her so she won’t stop.
She goes the straightest way in a car with them so you have to take the chance and go down and find her caravan.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up.”
“That’s how I look to the right and lose my face,” Birna goes and takes the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds about forty caravans, some marked and some not.
However, she doesn’t find her bike, and then she starts to despair.
“I feel the bug is pouring over me because I’ve spent half a day in this, but think so well, I tried.
It was fun.”
Vondauf keeps Birna back towards the hotel where she sees through the window the capture team watching herself with spring eyes, and it is clear that Birna did not succeed in her intentional work.
Birna accepts the fate and it begins to rain.
“I’m under cover to cover myself for the rain.
I look to the right and lose my face.”
No one but Mariska Hargitay was in the panty suit she was wearing, and Birna knew well —but Birna could hardly move by psychiatry.
“I look at my body and my hands and think now you have to move.
Now you have to go to her.”
The bears do it and remember to push the actor’s shoulder.
She looks at me and I can hardly say anything.
“But I’m just saying hello,” she shouts.
“I’m a big fan of Iceland.
She says, “I’m so glad to see you.”
The conversation didn’t go much further because the car of Marisku is coming and it’s fluteed on it.
Mariska turns to Birna and says, "I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you."
Birna greets the goddess of worship, looks at the car driving away and then breaks up.
“I’m calling Erling and Gunna and they thought this wasn’t going to happen.
But I was crying for excitement and joy.
I'll say, yes, I'll see her, you've got to meet me now.
Then we poured in soda water and tea," says Birna.
She doesn’t regret anything, even though she admits that she probably wouldn’t repeat the game.
“It’s like this once in a lifetime, spending so much time and energy to make this happen.
I will always be a fan of this woman.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir on the show Love Stories at Rás 1.
The police are not spreading the virus.
It’s a good idea that the coronavirus can be used by the police.
This is what a police officer in the police department in the capital area said in an interview with Mbl.is.
Tips have been received from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police arrive, occur on a traffic street and let anyone who has the way blow.
The police say the highest level of hygiene.
“It’s not really a special mouthpiece, but we recommend a cup that people blow in,” a police officer said.
“Some people want to put their lips on this, but we’re guiding people to keep a little distance, up to a few dozen centimeters.”
I asked if it was enough, a police officer said.
If the police prove positive, then use it at a different level.
He has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is used only once.
The abdomen: Among other things, anise can be embedded to reduce pain
The relationship with depression is not coincidence.
Individuals suffering from bowel inflammation, a disease characterized by abdominal pain, convulsions, temps, respiratory respiratory distress, constipation and diarrhea, often experience anxiety and depression, which can lead to worsening symptoms according to the U.S. ADAA.
“This is because the colon is partly controlled by the nervous system that reacts to stress,” ADAA explains.
If the tempan does not decrease, there may be food intolerance.
A judge tries to stop the decision that children will be released from the Immigration Authority
In his ruling on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee voided the prospective time limit by saying that the immigration and customs authorities in the United States do not have to let children out of prison if one of the three ways described in her previous directive cannot be done.
However, Gee also stressed in his order that the immigration and customs authorities should remain obligated to release their children without undue delay.
The three ways that Gee nominated are to release families held together by the Immigration and Customs Authorities, to put children in the hands of a responsible person, or to allow families to be released from a federal court ruling.
Shalyn Fluharty, the chief executive of the Proyecto Dilley, who provides families with legal services, condemned the decision and told her to put it in the hands of the immigration and customs authorities to decide whether to continue to have children in custody.
“The main thing is that children are kept prisoners prematurely and they are not released unless the immigration and customs authorities agree it or families agree to stand apart,” Fluharty said.
Families are held at three locations of immigration and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and Karnes County, Texas.
The children in these places are between 1 and 17 years of age, according to lawyers and representatives who provide legal assistance.
Gee, who supervised the implementation of the Flores Convention on Child Care in Detention, said in June that “the rules of masking and social distance would not or would not be followed” would be urgent to move children from these establishments.
969 people who are in custody of the immigration and customs authorities have been diagnosed with the coronavirus and are in isolation or surveillance as of 23 July, according to the immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, there are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley and two in family prison centers.
More than 3,700 cases have been confirmed in prison.
We will look at the law on the independence of the board.
The Prime Minister says it is not uncommon for pension funds to set a standard in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
The central bank’s comments on ensuring the independence of the board of directors of pension funds, possibly by law, will be taken into consideration.
After Icelandair took up negotiations with the Iceland Airlines Association and terminated all airlines, the board of directors declared that the board of directors appointed by the VR as the board of directors of the Pension Fund of the shoppers had a plan or voted against the participation of the pension fund in the expected Icelandair share fund.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of the VR, said the board members would be replaced if they did not get the recommendation.
Ragnar Thorr withdrew his statement three days later and also the control of VR.
Ásgeir Jónsson, CEO, said in the news of RÚV on Friday to ensure the independence of the board of directors of pension funds in the approved funds and possibly through a legal change.
The Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir says it is important that the board members of the pension funds are independent but already consider it secured by law.
“Now the Central Bank manager, who goes with the Financial Supervisory Authority, who has to do with this, has said that it needs to examine specifically the regulatory framework around this independence, we will, of course, take it into consideration if something needs to go over there,” she says.
Katrín says that according to law, pension funds should set themselves moral standards in their investment policy.
It is desirable to discuss the social and ethical criteria they want to emphasize in their investments.
“I didn’t think anything uncommon too that pension funds also set the criteria in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
“But I think it’s normal that such decisions are made through policymaking, not through individual investment decisions,” Katrín said.
“Unbearable traffic adventures at Ölfusárbro,” says the City Council of Årborg.
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City Council of Årborg, says a traffic trend, formed by Ölfusárbrú á Selfoss every day completely intolerant.
He hopes that an offer for new bridges will take place in the fall.
Now that Icelanders are travelling around their country and there is a lot of traffic on the country’s highways, there are daily traffic gaps at Ölfusárbrú when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the city.
Long rows form at the bridge and can take on the drivers' patience to wait in a row.
“Yes, it’s just a road trip here and not just on Fridays because it’s just been on business days as well.
“There are long waits, sometimes quite up Hellisheiði for those who want to get here on their way east to land and those who are coming west, so it gives an eye way that we need to get a new bridge and not later than yesterday,” says Helgi S. Haraldsson, Chairman of the City Council of Årborg.
Helgi says that the city authorities in Årborg have recently had a meeting with the CEO of the Vegagerðin and the designers of the Vegagerðin and that meeting was very positive.
“If you’ve ever been optimistic that it’s working on these issues, I think I can say it now because it’s really working on this and we should be able to see that a new bridge will be offered out this fall.”
But do you have any advice on the drivers who are in the queue at the Alpheus Bridge every day during the summer?
“Yes, it is possible to pass the narrows and through the Eyrarbakki, it hastens, but those who are going east on the road, it is not possible to point them to go the Lyngdalsheiði, but those who are going to the uprisings should use Mosfellsheiði, Thingvellir and Lyngdalsheiði.”
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City Council of Årborg, who says the traffic race, formed by the Ölfusárbrú við Selfoss insufferably.
Long waits form every day at the Ölfusár Bridge and drivers often need to wait for a considerable amount of time to cross the bridge.
Then the only advice is to breathe deeply and think something positive.
The future of home coal trees in northern Brisbane runs for an organizational judgement
The City Council said that in addition to the area being the vital home of coal bears, swiphing corpses and the grey gáshauks, it would be an important link between the natural regions of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Entrepreneurs have appealed against the refusal of the city government to the Court of Organization and Environmental Affairs on the grounds that the structure is in line with the law on city organisation since 2014, would meet the organisational and community needs that have not been met to this end and "can be carried out without unacceptable effects".
There is a great deal of opposition to this project in the neighborhood.
The developers argue that although the proposal is fully compliant with the organisation, it could be changed if it does not meet the requirements, rather than rejecting it.
Currently, the construction involves many levels, including a service center, childcare and 39 residential houses.
Public submissions were more than 120 during the consultation period, and most of them objected to the proposal as it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
Brisbane's leader said the city had to buy the country to protect the coal bar.
“Adrian Schrinner has to stop wasting taxpayers’ funds in the fight with a commissioner for a court and buy this country to protect the nature and wildlife of Brisbane,” said Mayor Cassidy.
“This is one of the most important homes of coal trees in the mountain to Mangroves and there is a number of coal trees.”
Schrinner said this week that the city government wanted the home of the coal trees in the area to be protected.
“We didn’t think the proposal was suitable for the area,” Schrinner said.
“I understand that this is now going through the judicial system and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will ensure that the home is preserved.”
Schrinner said that mapping of home coalabies was the joint responsibility of the city government and government, but that the government is responsible for the exact maps of home coalabies supported by local authorities when they take applications for construction for treatment.
Solskjær: The next step is to work something
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Man Utd’s coach, was hoping that the team would have secured a third place in the English Premier League today.
The team will play in the Champions League next season.
United needed a draw or a win against Leicester today and the result was the Red Devils.
“It’s a great achievement for the players to reach a third place based on what the situation has been like in the season.
I think that the boys could have come across a spiritual chat by winning such a big deal, as we have lost twice in the premiere of this season.
We knew we needed a final today, now we can start the next chapter with these boys winning titles,” Solskjær said.
Manchester United still has the chance to win a title during this season, but the team plays in the European League in August and is as good as 8th place.
Weapon break begins at midnight in war-torn Eastern Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine - The Ukrainian Army and anti-resistance force in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a “great” ceasefire that will begin at midnight and as representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after a conflict for 6 years.
On Sunday, an anti-defense officer said they had ordered a ceasefire and issued a ban on the use of weapons.
Ukraine said its forces have "prepared" for the ceasefire.
If it succeeds, it would "pay the way for the implementation of other provisions" the Minsk peace treaty, according to the statement of the President of Ukraine earlier this week where the ceasefire was called a timing step.
The goal of the Minsk peace treaty, made in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and the separatists enjoying Russia’s participation, which began in 2014 following Russia’s inclusion in the Crimea and the country’s support for separatists.
More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine welcomed the two arms break on Sunday and emphasized the importance of implementing the agreement reached at the meeting in Paris in December.
Vladimir Putin, Russian President, expressed concern over the call of Kiev that the Minks Agreement should be reviewed and said that Volodimír Selensky’s position on “the irreversibility of the Minsk agreement, which he once again revealed in this call, should be reflected in real action.”
Selensky, on the other hand, stressed the need to take "severe action" to liberate the Ukrainians who are prisoners of rebels in eastern Ukraine, on the incumbent Crimea and in Russia, according to a statement from the president's office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only gain control over borders with Russia in the areas in which the separatists have their power when they have gained widespread autonomy and when the elections have been held in the regions.
The agreement reduced conflicts, but the Ukrainians and rebels have continued to engage in shootings.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December for other talks, the Minsk agreement was announced and agreed to start the peace process again.
Selensky, who won the elections in 2019 with promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to have control over the borders before the first regional elections, but the government in the Kremlin demands that the agreement be implemented without change.
The new ceasefire agreement was reached on Wednesday by the support of a three-sided co-operation group appointed by the representatives of Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
During the traditional Sunday blessings on Peterstorg, Pope Francis also recalled the ceasefire and said that it needed to “rebuild trust and lay the foundation for very necessary and long-term peace with the people.”
Police: A man shot to death in protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A man was shot dead in protests in Texas when he approached a car and the driver in the car released his weapon, according to police.
Katrina Ratliff, a police spokesman, told reporters early on Sunday that the shooting had taken place just before 22:00 in Austin.
The man was taken to a hospital where he was later convicted.
The car had whispered, bowed down the road, and then speeded up the journey towards protestors, witness Michael Capochiano told Austin American-Statesman magazine.
The man who had a rifle, according to Capochiano, approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, Capochiano said.
Ratliff told reporters that the first reported success indicates that "the victim might have had a rifle" and added that the suspect was in custody and would be willing to cooperate with the police.
According to news agencies, the group had gathered because of the Black Lives Matter counters on Saturday.
The event was streamed live on Facebook and there was a whistle in the car and a few shots released.
Marksuppa in the first win of Blika in July
Breiðablikk won his first league victory from June 29 when the team launched the IA, 5-3 in the Pepsi Max men's league at Kópavogsvöllur tonight.
The team loses their third game in the league.
After winning their first three games in the league, Breiðblik played five games without celebrating victory and had lost three in a row for the game with the IA tonight.
So it was to be enough or to die for Blika who had a great deal of power into the game.
Alexander Helgi Sigurðarson led the team with a straightforward finish in the 11th minute after Kristin Steindórsson had sent him through the defence of the AA.
Six minutes later, Kristin doubled the lead after the very fine preparation of the gisslan Eyjólfsson of the left edge.
Scotsmen were not able to find countries or beaches in the first half, where the high pressure of locals made them tremendous for connecting shipments.
He had all the power on the field and scored the third goal in the 36th minute when Dan Thomas Mikkelsen shook in Höskuldur Gunnlaugsson's corners.
Then Kristin Steindórsson scored his second goal and the fourth goal Blika only three minutes later.
The story of the first half did not end there.
Scotsmen got hopeful for the latter when Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored out of tribute shortly before a play break, but Kwame Quee had then broken silly on Viktori Jónssyni within the tie Blika.
4-1 was therefore the place for a moment when the half-float defected.
Only three minutes had passed by the second half when the scorers scored again.
Hlynur Sævar Jónsson was then alone and unspoilt at Blika's markeig and easily controlled the ball in the net after the hornspyrna Tryggva Hrafns Haraldsson.
However, it was only three minutes later when he broke Alexander Helga.
Thomas Mikkelsen was convicted and scored safely to bring Breiðablik 5-2 over when only seven minutes had passed by the second half.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's goal, the scorers scored again.
Anton Ari Einarsson, goalkeeper Blika, was under pressure from Viktori Jónssyni, gave the ball in the foot of Viktors from where the ball rejected in the net.
An incredible 5-3 position was set when less than ten minutes had passed from the second half, but it slowed down the goal score.
Despite the great chances of both teams to add a goal, including the two deadly Kwame Quee from Breiðastund, they were no more and 5-3 Breiðastund's victory.
Breiðablikk won his first victory in nearly a month, from 29 June, and has been the team after the victory with 14 points in the third place, two points from the Val that is seat above and three from the top team KR.
They both play in the game.
The IA must accept the third loss in a row in the league, but the team has ten points in the eighth place, five points from the falls seat.
The White House is not in danger.
The puppy manufacturers announced yesterday that they would not stop showing the baby material in the near future.
The statement follows Kayleigh McEnany, the White House media agent,’s statement that the episodes that dealt with, among other things, law enforcement dogs are the victims of “exclusion culture”.
Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnany’s words and released that their fans didn’t have to worry about the future of the Puppy band.
A number of television series dealing with the jobs of police have been depicted in the U.S. recently following a protest against police violence.
However, the puppy band is not there, despite the rumor of this material on social media.
At a White House press conference on Friday, McEnany said that President Trump was opposed to “exclusion culture” and especially when it came to the police.
The term refers to it when the opinions or actions of individuals or companies raise a severe response to social media and are called upon to be malformed for objection.
“We saw it a few weeks ago that the shows on the Puppy band, child stuff about cops, were stopped.
"It's the same with Cops and Live PD," McEnany said on Friday.
She added that the Danish toy maker Lego has taken a law enforcement kit out of sale, but there is no foot for that claim, according to Lego’s defense officers.
However, it is true that the Cops and Live PD reality shows have recently been taken out of the West Sea show.
Both episodes are controversial for showing pictures of real police jobs without obtaining permission from individuals who appear there.
For 29 years - Sometimes there is jealousy and suspicion
Kristín Tómasdóttir, a family therapist, answers readers’ questions about family, children and love in the family corner of DV.
This time, she responds to readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, have been together for 29 years and have two children.
We know nothing but to be together and we feel good, but we both feel like we’re missing something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparison of how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust in relation to whether the other person is looking around, thinking about adultery or even divorce and changing.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is the kind of marathon that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for the great question and I am glad you have such an open communication that you can discuss your complex well-being in relation to the relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking this at either corner, could not discuss this and even step any step you could later see.
Everything on the table, isn’t it always the best?
Strong self-identity has the most prediction of happiness in the future and the stronger the self-identity you have, the more likely you are to have a partner with a strong self-identity.
The reason why relationships that begin in adolescence do not always last all their lives is often that people develop in either direction, but in cases where there will be a coherent effect, individuals can become stronger as a whole than many others.
Since your relationship begins to form during your greatest forming years, the conclusion that you have grown together can be drawn and have a positive effect on each other’s identity.
We are in the relationships we are in.
How I speak, is shaped by how you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relationships shape who we are.
You could turn the example back and think: what do we have that others don’t have?
How many years do these specialities give us?
I can say that the benefits can be much more than the disadvantages.
You have formed each other for years, and as a result, you can say that you are customized in millimetres of each other.
That’s more than many can say.
It's worth it?
You’re talking that you’ve missed something, but it’s important to remind yourself that big changes like divorce and a new relationship also follow a follow-up that you’re not necessarily excited about.
You may miss to start up again, to learn to be alone again, to get to know a new person and to put together families.
This follows new challenges, different problems and possibly something new and exciting.
But this doesn’t just come with a pale cloud and happiness, unneedingly, at your age, this can be an insane task, which could possibly never be as well as you have already done to each other.
Is it worth it?
Wouldn’t you like to focus on what you can do to increase tension, unpredictability and innovation in your relationship?
You haven’t put your shoes on the shelf.
There are so many things you can do to make this long relationship even deeper.
What experiments can you do with it?
What do you need from your partner that you are not getting?
What can you give to your spouse that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and re-defined your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Do you want to try something new?
Today, there is much more tolerance to various forms of relations and couples are beginning to define their relationships in various ways, e.g. open relationships, multi-anxieties, or decides to stop temporarily together.
I'm not telling you what to do, because no expert in your solutions, but perhaps it would relieve this heavy fat that swamps over you, if you look into this and think about solutions.
What do you need to be distrustful and fearful?
You’ve been together for 29 years, it must mean you’re able to do a lot of things together.
Take advantage of it as strength and stay in your hands towards your solution.
We encourage readers to send questions and suggestions to Kristín by email at: hjonabandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in the family corner, of course anonymously and in full confidence.
Lost the cup and peeled it
Despite Branislav Ivanovic’s extensive experience of lifting cups and celebrating titles, he lost and broke an impressive award after becoming a Russian Cup champion yesterday.
Ivanovic won a number of titles as a Chelsea player in 2008-2017, but then returned to Russia and joined the ranks of Zenit.
He has now become a Russian champion for two consecutive years, and yesterday the team secured the Cup Championship with a 1-0 win over Khimki, where the winning goal came from the champion Artem Dzyuba in the 84th minute.
The awards in the Russian Cup are made of glass and when Ivanovic, the leader of Zenit, lost the cup to the ground so that it broke, as can be seen.
Ivanovic and his companions did not let it go and continued the joy until the night.
It's a war!
Coleen Rooney leads Johnny Depp in the Wagatha Christie rim with Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against allegations of injuries against Rebekah Vardy
After discussions between the partner of the footballers went through the duvet, their acquaintances expect dramatic settlements
Coleen Rooney has hired the star lawyer in Johnny Depp’s case to defend himself in his “Wagatha Christie” legal party with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday simulates that Rooney has ordered David Sherborne to defend herself against allegations of injuries against Vardy, with allegations that personal data has been leaked to the media by her closed Instagram access.
A few days after data was submitted to the Supreme Court, Rebekah Vardy, who is married to soccerman Jamie Vardy in Leicester City, has suffered physically and mentally following Coleen Rooney’s statements.
The 38-year-old five-year-old mother said she had “severe convulsions and anxieties, so she was afraid to leave the house” and that Vardy, who was then seven months on her way, “has been admitted to a hospital three times because of anxieties that can be caused by the post and its consequences.”
In addition to being Depp's lawyer in his injured case against The Sun, due to allegations that the actor has beaten his wife, Sherborne, aged 50, leaves with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their private case against Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After the negotiations between the two soccer husbands failed, those who are familiar with the dramatic settlements in the courtroom would be expected to fail.
“If you found the Depp trial analytical, do not underestimate the prospective war of the football peers,” a reporter said.
"Now it's a real war. Coleen leaves nothing, and not Becky either. It's going to be emotional."
Coleen Rooney argued that someone who used Instagram access Rebekah Vardy would have leaked inspiring stories about her for a newspaper.
She was named "Wagatha Christie" after clearing out how she spent five months limiting the number of friends who could see updates on her Instagram stories until only Vardy's account was left.
Coleen said he had written a story on Instagram, which would have appeared in a gossip magazine.
In Vardy’s case documents, she claims that she was made a boycott after Rooney published the accusations “with the intention of causing great harm and tremendous suffering.”
Coleen's lawyers have questioned these words, saying that allegations of her suffering are just put before the media and draw attention from the facts of the matter.
A source said: “The Becky’s documents are misleading, it’s all upset.”
Paul Lunt is a lawyer at the law firm Brabners, Liverpool, who is a member of Coleen Rooney, who has four sons with former England champion Wayne Rooney.
Vardy is at the London law firm Kingsley Napley, and she is not sure if she has hired a lawyer yet.
Coleen Rooney, a spokesman, refused to interview.
Bidens voter rejects the "Fox News Sunday" interview one week after interview Chris Wallace with Trump
In Trump’s interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump doubted that the prospective Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden would deal with the questionnaire that Wallace dropped on Trump.
We may never answer that question, at least not for a while.
On Sunday, Wallace announced that the Bidens election team had told Fox News that he was “not free” at an interview.
“In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent in the Democratic Party, Joe Biden, would plummet himself in a similar situation,” Wallace said.
“This week, Bidens’ election team asked for an interview and they said the former Vice President was not available.”
“We continue to ask each week,” he added.
Trump’s election team has been criticizing Biden for a few months for avoiding a ballot and press conference while he attends interviews during the Crown Viral Pandemic.
Although Biden has recently resumed his election journey, Trump and his associates have continued to mock the vice-president for “hiding” at their home in Delaware.
However, Bidens’ reluctance to attend public events has not damaged his availability, as recent surveys show that Biden has a good advantage over Trump both nationally and in major combat countries.
Real Clear Politics estimates that the president was 7 percent in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump won all the states in 2016 when he turned them over to the Republican Party when he won the fight for the White House.
In the latest Fox News Poll survey, Biden has an advantage in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, beyond chess limits in all cases.
The survey also suggests that Biden has a slight advantage in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important fighters in these elections.
And surveys suggest that states previously trusted in the Republican fortifications, such as Texas and Georgia, are now divided between Trump and the former Vice President.
Presidential elections for the second term in the White House are often a vote on that president - and it seems to be the case now in 2020 in the struggle between Trump and Bidens.
The most prominent issues have been the coronavirus and economics that are lowered due to the epidemic - and the performance and history of the president in both categories.
Kanye West and his wrestling with psychiatry
Musician Kanye West today apologised to his wife Kim Kardashian for commenting that he had fallen into aggression.
Geðhjálpar’s Chairman thinks he’s taking his creativity into the psychiatry, but a psychiatrist says it’s important that people take drugs to keep the disease in check.
Rapparen Kanye West is not only one of the most influential and influential musicians of the time, but he is no less famous as the husband of the reality show star Kim Kardashian.
His personal life has largely been done in open places.
He announced earlier this month that he was likely to offer himself to the president of the United States, and held an emotional and irresistible speech.
Later, some strange tweets appeared from him on Twitter, claiming, among other things, that his wife was trying to put him in hospital.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram asking people to show their husband and family understanding; he had bipolar disorder, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he didn’t want to seek help himself.
He has since apologized publicly.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people have mental health.
Ferdinand Jónsson is a psychiatrist at a hospital in London, and knows the disease well.
“This disease can cause such a tremendous impetus to individuals and especially their families and loved ones.
This misery or mania can destroy relationships and work and cause tremendous grief.
And so the other side, depression, it is often dangerous, because there is a high frequency of suicides in that group.
I thought it was nice that she said that.
“It’s human and human,” Ferdinand said.
Unnsteinsson, Chairman of Geðhjálpar, himself has struggled with mental health — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very lively imagination.
If we are four strings of earthly contrabasses, he is a hundred strings of celestial harp.
And he is so overwhelmingly creative, overwhelmingly powerful, and certainly in his fierce relationship thinking, because one must have been with this relationship thought that we who have had to try it to go to the state of fanaticism know so well.”
Kanye West doesn’t want to take psychotic drugs because he thinks they’re detracting from his creativity.
He has discussed the mentality, including the album Ye.
He said it was his choice not to take drugs.
“Many people feel that this creative element, which is inherent in this unheard of relationship and the cruel creativity of the fire that it has, is naturally the deficiencies of it often great suffering, and the waves and dark basements and darkness.”
Ferdinand, however, says it is important that people with bipolar disorder get treatment.
“If you have a lot of enthusiasm or mania, you’re not making anything amazing, you’re just on the side.
And like when people get into a severe depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition,” he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medication?
"Obviously," said Ferdinand.
“And especially working with someone to find the right dosages and this way that there will be a balance between the drug helping him the most, destroying as much as he and his abilities and his creativity.”

Delhi Metro casts the first pillar at the fourth stage of construction
The Delhi Metro reached an important phase of the fourth stage of construction when the first chair was steeped for the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, which is being proposed, according to employees on Sunday.
The pole was formed in Keshopur and on an elevated part between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.
“Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) stepped another important step at the fourth stage of the construction is the first pillar at this stage of the expansion of the train system was cast for the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg,” the statement said.
This “importance of implementation” was achieved despite the lack of workforce and other organizational challenges caused by the world’s epidemic, according to workers.
The average height of the pillars on this route is 10 meters.
However, the pillars will be 20 meters high at Madhuban Chowk, where the route overlaps with route 1, and 25 meters at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the route meets route 2.
At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the bridge will be 28 metres high, which is the largest floor in the history of the Dehli Metro.
The highest point of the train system is at Dhaula Kuan, where the bridge road leads 7 reaches 23.6 meters.
In the context of construction engineering, the pillars are vertical load-bearing structures that support the adjacent end of the two paths.
They form vertical structures that carry up the elevated bridge road of the train system.
This train system can be seen on the numerous highways under the railroads in Delhi.
The number of pillars now plays an important role as a landmark for addresses in the Delhi metropolitan area.
The 28.92 km long route from Janakpuri West to R K Ahsram Marg is an extension of the Magenta route, with 22 stations on it.
21.18 km of the road will be lifted and 7.74 km will be underground.
Construction of this section began in December last year.
On 17 July, work began in the underground section of the route when the construction of the Krishna Park Extension train station began.
On 24 June, the DMRC began to set up a U-bit that would later be placed in the elevated part of the route.
At the fourth stage of construction, 61,679 km of new train train will be laid for three different routes with 45 train stations.
These new parts will offer connections between the parts of the train system already operated by the Delhi Metro.
Of them, 22.35 km underground, while other parts are raised.

The global epidemic has brought more than 633.000 people to death worldwide since it was found in China late last year, and more than 15.5 million people have been infected, according to the AFP.
The Ambassador wants a gun, a armored car and a stunning west - said subscribers are the memorial of the “deep state”
Politically appointed U.S. ambassador to this country, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is said to be carrying a gun on himself in the news of CBS today.
“Despite being located in one of the safest states in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is “sick” about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavik last year.”
Referring to CBS in 12 diplomas, ex-representants and individuals familiar with the matter.
Gunters’ conclusion was to demand from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that they requested permission for the ambassador to go about armed in the country.
He is also supposed to have asked for a armored car that travelled with him between the locations of Iceland and the stunguvest.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to comment on whether any threat was a result of the security of the ambassador, but the representatives of the U.S. government said the ambassador had been told that Iceland was a safe country and that it was safe here.
Although it would have been advertised by the guards in Icelandic newspapers, CBS says, and if it’s part of meeting the ambassador’s demands.
According to CBS, the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on the case with CBS.
However, the U.S. news agency has reported to its authors in this country that no request has been received by the province’s government.
In addition, CBS said that Gunter was being spoken of as being armed as it would infringe the host state, Iceland.
The ambassador was awarded his honour for support for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election.
He was a doctor in California.
Since joining May, Gunter said he has created an "impossible" working environment in the embassy, and he has already had seven subscribers, so-called Deputy Chief of Mission, the subscribers of the embassy who are also sent diplomats.
Everyone was a proven diplomat from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The first was sent away by the ambassador, "because he didn't see his appearance."
He had been preparing for a year and learned Icelandic.
The next one lasted only six months.
In the aftermath, a rooting of staff was created, and the thought was to let Gunter tune most until he looked at one of them.
Furthermore, CBS said that Gunter loved the embassy’s staff to join the “deep state” and to have buried him in Washington D.C.
Officers of the Foreign Ministry in D.C. are said to be well aware of the situation at their embassy in Reykjavik, but have been hesitant to seize the embassy’s analytics in light of Gunter’s connection with the White House.
Gunter is also said to have had difficulty following the orders of the State Department in Washington, and he is said to have refused to return to D.C. while the Covid-19 epidemic was destroyed.
He left the embassy in the hands of his employees for several months.
He is said to have intended to work from his home in California unless ordered by the Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Turn back at last
Finally, Gunter returned to Iceland in May.
Michelle Yerkin, his new co-chairman, came to the country this month.
CBS has not received answers to their requests to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on CBS, nor on the request of DV.
Gunter is one of the many politically appointed ambassadors of the Trump administration who has attracted attention for unusual behavior over the past few months.
Woody Johnson had a hard reaction when he was trying to move the British Open Championship to golf at Trump’s property.
The ambassador to South Africa has also been in charge of running his number two men and then attempting to appoint her son to the job.
42% of the U.S. Ambassador is politically appointed.
30% were politically assigned to the government of Obama, and 32% to the government of George W. Bush.

Poland will declare a European treaty to prevent violence against women
The right-wing government of Poland says that the country will withdraw from the European Convention to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul Convention is the first binding legal instrument in the world that aims to prevent violence against women, while Poland’s Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro describes the text as “harmful” where he claims that schools teach children about gender from a social perspective.
Ziobro said on Monday he would start preparing a formal process for the country to resign the deal.
“This ideological element relates to attempts to change education in schools and leisure activities, in terms of the study, attitude and conviction of young generations of Poland, based on the conclusion that, in our opinion, is incorrect, that biological sex is old-fashioned and that everything is actually about social culture.”
Ziobro believes that the provisions of the Convention on Education of Children and Young People and Family Relations in the context of LGBT people are unacceptable.
“We also reject the LGBT episode in the discussion on family relationships, because this is an opinion held by left activists or groups of homosexuals who want their opinions to become binding laws,” he said.
On Sunday, the European Council said that it was “certain” that Poland was supposed to resign from the deal.
On Friday, Warsaw protested about 2,000 people, including women's and other groups of rights fighters, outside the offices of the right-wing organizations Ordo Luris, who support the country's resignation.
"We're not going to be victims," they said.
The protests also took place in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Agreement to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, engineer at Honorary Palace, died 81 years old
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, who was part of a quarter-mile racetrack that counts his father Lee and his brother Richard, and who was the first engineer to be taken into the Honorary Palace of Nascar, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family did not give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While his other family members were acclaimed for his talents behind the steering wheel, Maurice Petty earned the nickname "The Director" for his talent with the screwdriver.
He helped his family win 198 races and seven titles in the NASCAR Premier League, and also built machines that assured Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal and Pete Hamilton's victory.
“The director was one of the most advanced mechanics in the history of NASCAR,” said the chairman and CEO Jim France.
“He came with the power that helped Petty Enterprises achieve his superiorities in the sports field.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also performed a number of roles behind the scenes and did what needed to bring his vehicles on the winning track."
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939 in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the race track when he was small and his knowledge of mechanical engineering soon became a major part of landing Lee Petty in 54 competitions and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR Cup between 1960-64, was seven times in the top five seats and 16 times in the top ten.
However, he soon decided to focus on what happens under the engine cover rather than behind the steering wheel, which proved a charm for his older brother, who relied on his machines during his victory march.
Richard, then known as the King, won the first championship in 1964 with the Plymouth Automobile.
They won again in 1967, then two years in a row in 1970 and 1971, and scored three more titles before the eighties ended.
With these seven titles on their back, they share the highest number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and, during his career at Petty Enterprises, was involved in building one of the top teams in NASCAR,” Winston Kelley said in a statement.
"Although Petty's wins are recorded as 212, he claims well over 250 wins, if taken with all the machines he designed for his rivals.
The manager will be remembered forever as the best machine in the history of NASCAR."
Lee Petty died in 2000 and Maurice Petty's wife died in 2014.
He was also the cousin of former driver Kyle Petty and Trent Owens.
“While we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and accomplished pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his heritage and name will be kept in our memories, kept up and preserved for the future,” Kelley said.
“We send our deepest sympathy to the Petty family.”
"Wand enters" continued stay in prison cell
The police in the city had a lot to do today.
One of the police missions was to arrest a man at the police station this morning.
He had been released from a prison cell shortly before, but refused to leave, repeatedly came back and did not obey the police's orders to leave.
“He stayed with the police,” the police said.
Other police officers reported body assaults in Breiðholt at 11 o'clock this morning and had a police offence of two men.
Then the police had an act of a woman in a shopping mall in Kópavogur, she had been sitting there for a meal but had no funds to pay the account.

Sale Pedros from Chelsea confirmed and teammates say goodbye to him by singing in the dressing room
Frank Lampard, CEO of Chelsea, honored Chancellor Pedro Rodriguez after he played his last league game for the club on Sunday.
The 32-year-old player agreed to extend his contract temporarily to finish the season with the club, but goes on free sale to AS Roma at the end.
The Spanish national team, which came from Barcelona in 2015, has played a major role at Lampard during this season, because he has only been eight times in the Premier League start-up and played a total of 21 games in all competitions.
The Chairman of the West London Blue Crew confirmed Pedro's departure after the club secured a place in the top four seats with a 2-0 win against Wolves, where the race came in from the class to play its last game.
“Pedro has played his last game with the club,” Lampard told Sky Sports.
“The boys honoured him in the dressing room, and it is deserved when looking at his career as a whole and with the club.
This was his last game, but he has set his mark firmly on the team.
I would like to thank Pedro very much and wish him success in the future.
He will be here the remaining games but with him will leave a great player, and the companion I witnessed that after the game was quite special.
Pedro posted a greeting message on his Twitter account where he wrote: “My last game on Stamford Bridge.
I want to thank every fan for the support over the years, the company for giving me the opportunity to be blue dressed, and my teammates.
You will always have a place in my heart.
Let's go get the FA Cup!!
"The Big Blues of the Family."
Pedro, who previously played as a forward in Barcelona, now leaves Chelsea after he has been with the team since winning the title in 2017 under Antonio Conte, the FA Cup in 2018, as well as the European League a year later under Maurizio Sarri.
He took another arrest.
A man was arrested for the second time this morning after refusing to leave the police station after he was released.
The man was arrested last night for drunken driving, and he was kept in prison overnight.
When he was released this morning, he refused to go away and reportedly came back to police.
He did not respond repeatedly to the police's orders to leave, and he "remained" a continued stay at the police, according to the police journal in the capital area.
Restaurants that keep the two-metre rule
It’s great to see how restaurants keep the two-metre rule in order to keep their restaurants open and respect all the rules that have been laid down.
Here are a few pictures from the world, where the mood is a little different from here in the country.
Soldiers destroy camps and capture troops in Zamfara state
Air attacks by the HADARIN DAJI air force have destroyed new camps under the rule of the so-called "Dangote" in the Doumborou Forest in Zamfara State.
Chief John Enenche and Defence Representative said that the air strike, where also a number of fighters fell, had been carried out following the HUMINT data collection and a number of air surveillance to confirm.
The commander of Enenche said that the espionage had revealed that the members of the country had moved with supplies, motorcycles and hundreds of stolen cattle from their previous resort to the new place around rocky mountainous terrain inside the forest.
Enenche said that, in the future, the air force had sent a specialized force of battle aircraft and armed helicopters from the Nigerian army to attack the area.
It is noted: “The attack aircraft shot accurate shots in the area and killed some of the fighters.
Many others, who are seen trying to escape the area in the confusion, were killed in further attacks.”
Along with commending the operation of HADARIN DAJI for his professionalism, the commander of the Air Force, Sadique Abubakar, urged the forces to leave nowhere in air strikes on the fighters.
The military commander ordered them to continue their air operations in support of land operations, to eradicate all of the troops and to rest in the northwest and central part of the north.
← The First Chronovirus Steam in North Korea
The North Korean state news agency reported last night that the first COVID-19 case was likely to have been detected there in the country.
According to the report, the infected man who fled a country three years ago returned to North Korea last week.
The man was in the border city of Kaesong when he was diagnosed with the coronavirus, and the city has been isolated and exit ban placed on the inhabitants.
Kim Jong-un, the North Korean Democrat, was called to an emergency meeting with high-ranking officials, which was planned for responses to this terrible past.
According to the state television news, Kim ordered that the “maximum security measures” be taken to stop the spread of the virus.
He also foresaw a study on how the man came across the well protected borders of the two Koreans and warned that those responsible for it should have "hard punishment" over their heads.

Serbia wants to increase the number of military aircraft in increasing tensions in the Balkans
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its army and seek to buy more military aircraft as the thrill increases in the Balkans, said President of Serbia on Sunday.
President Aleksandar Vucic said that "some reversals" were in the process of purchasing naval combat machines, and accused the United States and other Western states of armed neighbouring Serbia in NATO, as well as Kosovo, which was formerly a province in Serbia.
“Americans, Turks and Germans take good care of their loving offspring,” Vucic said, referring to Cosovo.
He said the United States had recently handed over a large number of armored cars to Cosovo.
On a visit to the Serbian Army, Vucic said his nation could not compete with NATO’s contributions to neighbors’ armed forces and that “That’s why we’re on our own.”
Vucic did not specify what type of military aircraft Serbia was supposed to buy, but the media side-hollowed government said his government has officially requested the delivery of 20 attack aircraft from the United States.
It is said that no response was received from Washington on the request from Belgrade, and that if it is rejected, it is likely that an attack aircraft of the type Sukhoi-25 from Russia will be purchased.
Serbia, which maintains a military neutrality policy, has recently delivered a highly advanced air defense system from Russia, which has also provided battle jets, assault helicopters and armored vehicles.
China, also a Federation of Serbia, has handed over the state drones for use in warfare.
U.S. officials have discussed openly to bring criminal action against Serbia if more weapons are brought to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could jeopardise the security of neighbouring NATO countries.
In the West and in the neighbouring countries of Serbia, people are looking at the armament of Russia and China in Serbia.
Tensions are now growing in the Balkans, but there was a civil war in the 1990s.
The Atlantic Alliance had a breakdown of Serbia to stop the bloody operations of Serbia against the separatists of Cosovo-Albania in 1999.
Despite formally attempting to join the European Union, the populist leader of Serbia has further strengthened its political and military ties with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, do not recognize the independence of the Cossabo, which the United States and most Western countries have recognized.
Heart attack: Likes of this deadly disease situation can decrease by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that certain sweets could be good for heart muscle.
What is it? And how could it reduce the chances of a heart attack?
Scientists have made a collection analysis of coronary artery disease that spans five decades.
The main signs and symptoms of coronary artery disease (also referred to as heart dehydration) are three: chest pain (angina), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms of the disease may be heartbeat and severe shortness of breath.
“Chocolate contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoide, methylxanthine, polyphenol and steroid acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also known as high-density fatigue protein, collects “bad” cholesterol — a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart — and transports it into the liver.
The “bad” cholesterol (low density of fat deposits) is broken down into the liver and then separated from the body.
However, the new study does not examine the dosages or the type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether the participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate or other cocoa sweets.
The results were based on an earlier study that concluded that the consumption of cocoa (which is found in chocolate) reduced the likelihood of a heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoide found in chocolate lowers blood pressure and improves vascular function.
The vascular function refers to how well the blood spreads oxygen and nutrients around the body and transports wastes away.
There was no reference to lifestyles in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said that those who had admitted to eating chocolate would be more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and feel less stress.
“Each of these factors could have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system,” she added.
Coles exchanges plastic toys for books in a new collection campaign
“We have really listened and that was a key element in the preparation of a project,” Ronson said.
"We don't believe people want to recycle the books - we think they will want to have them, but they can recycle at home if they want."
Ronson said the new campaign has been underway long before the COVID-19 came to history, and despite the epidemic, she believes that the timing of the new campaign was “something good” because of the amount of time parents are now spending with their children.
Analysts have expressed concern that consumers are tired of the continuous toy collection campaigns of the largest supermarkets, but Ronson says no signs of fatigue are seen yet.
“We haven’t seen anything like that yet, but we keep our eyes open,” she said.
“We analyze a lot of data, from week to week, month to month, to ensure that what we discloses is consistent with our customers.
It was Cloes that paved the way for gathering campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first in the middle of 2018 was the driving force behind the best quarterly sales of the supermarket from the beginning.
Woolworths followed with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the supermarket to boost its sales, and now last offers the environmentally friendly promotional Discovery Garden customers free herbs and flowers for planting.
However, this new fundraising campaign could have a minor impact this time as UBS analysts predict increased sales in Australia during the largest part of the 2021 financial year.
Ronson said clients can expect a wide range of collection campaigns in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to become less common.
“There’s a lot of gathering campaigns around the world that we look at and we’re constantly getting inspiration from other countries,” she said.
“We need to do this to ensure that we do more and more with our customers.”
I've had five rounds around the country this summer.
The photographer and material producer Jón Ragnar Jónsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been more and less on the fleet of Iceland since the World War.
Jón completed his suspicious business studies at the University of Reykjavik a few years ago but is now working on travelling and producing marketing materials for individuals and companies.
The summer started early at Jóni, or in April, when he travelled all over the Westfjord and stayed in his car.
It’s been a year since he’s been around 5 or 6 circles.
He also had a lot of day trips here and there.
What journey has gone?
“For someone like me who is always on track and has seen everything, it’s hard to name a favorite place.
It’s more the weather and the company that matters.
I’ve recently been on high ground since the opening of the roads in June.
They always stand up because there is so much adventure to get to your destination.
The last trip there is a possible favorite trip of the year, but then we went 25 together on 5 large cars up the River River and from there to the River River River."
What’s ahead of you this summer?
“It’s a lot of exciting for me in the near future, but I’m finishing a diving course with DIVE and now take a diving trip here and there around Iceland.
Then I was adding a surfboard to my "dottakassann" so I'll be more out in the sea than before.
I’m going on a 10-day solo journey with everything I need my back, but it turns out later in the summer wherever I go.
“I’m going to be in highlands in the near future because it can’t be seen all year round.”
Which place in Iceland is your favorite?
“It’s always hard to choose one place, but I’ve been a part of my life since I remember.
My family and I went every summer to a place at the roots of Breiðamerkurjökull and since then I have always felt good in that area.
I’m sure I’ve been there over 100 times.”
Where in Iceland do you recommend visiting people?
“I’m going to bring one pearl from every part of the country, but there are: Múlagljótur in the South, Stuðlingil in the East, Aldeyjarfoss in the North, Redassandur in the Westfjords, Snæfellsjökull in the West and last but not last... Mælfell upp á Hálendi.”
What is important in the journey?
“I’m not going out on land unless I have the following in the car: Good pocket light, hanging bed, lopapeyse, hunting hives, peasant cubes, cooling boxes and bites... those who know me know what I’m talking about.”
Seeking 24 Rohingyas Who Feared to Drink Out of Island in Malaysia
QUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - The Malaysian authorities said on Sunday that there were 25 Rohingya refugees who feared having drowned after launching a boat off the tourist island of Langkawi, north of Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a senior official at the Malaysian National Guard, said that the first information police showed that only one of the 25 Rohingyas who had jumped from the boat had been able to swim to land.
The man who survived searched for help from police late on Saturday and has been imprisoned while the case is investigated more closely, Zawawi said.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim rohingyas have fled Myanmar due to military action, many of whom live in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the population of Malaysia, which has been the frequent destination of boats of parties that promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said two ships and aircraft were used for the search.
He said that the National Guard will also make sailors in the area and the authorities in the neighboring country of Thailand alert to them to help with the search.
He didn’t give any more information about the boat.
Last month, the Malaysian authorities arrested 269 Rohingya refugees and found bodies on board a boat suspected of being used to smuggling off Langkawi’s shores, but they claimed he had been damaged intentionally so he could not return to sea.
Malaysia’s territorial guard later said that the 269 individuals had been shipped from a larger vessel with dozens of people believed to have died and their bodies were thrown into the sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that Malaysia could not accept more Rohingya refugees as it wrestles with economic disruption due to the Crown Viral Pandemic.
He said that those who are already in the country will not be sent back to the sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live, as well as about 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers, including 101,000 rohingyas, registered at the UN Refugee Organization.
Residents of Aswan collect, monitor and return the cargo of chocolate to Sudan by car velocity
The transport vehicle is on its way to Sudan with many tons of chocolate selected on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the intersection of the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell to death due to heat.
The residents grouped to help the driver where he lay and save the goods that had been occupied.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, stated that the driver was “passing through our village; we couldn’t just stand by.
We need to help people in need, no matter where they come from.”
He added that villagers had come to an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the car’s cargo, which is estimated at three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr said the villagers have been on the scene from morning to evening and saved as much of the cargo as they could.
“The most important thing we felt was to save the driver’s life, protect the cargo and reopen the international road,” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the injured driver with water and a house shelter, Bahr said, adding that they just wanted to make sure he came to and from the village safely.
There were already brottalms in the Senate. The crown virus could make them worse.
“The global epidemic alone is calling on our ideal representative for the leadership and vision we expect in times of difficulty,” says a report prepared from the interview series held by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communications at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“But we are also faced with other debts that are about our nation’s inheritance sins and the racial immorality that has harassed our country since its establishment.”
The study is reviewed in connection with the disgraceful state of the parliament: the lack of actual relations between categories, a agenda that restricts the opportunity for communication, too much compression of power in leadership positions, continuous demands for fundraisers, outreach of cooperation between categories, the negative effects of the media that are operated 24/7, then facts
It is also warned that the parliament will move more into an online world because of the global pandemic where such a system, which allows elections with the help of deputies in a representative department without having to travel to Washington, could still improve the existing problems.
If the idea of a telecom meeting reaches a foothold, it would be a serious backlash for attempts to increase communication between categories, as stated in the report.
“The world’s epidemic forced the parliament to transfer most of its activities to the Internet and we certainly understand why,” the report said.
“But even if it was necessary, it should not be interpreted as a virtue.”
The document says that the Senate needs "more than no less communication between the Senators, face to face."
They need to explore each other’s districts better, have polite conversations to find common surfaces and build relationships based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions.”
The call for courtesy was especially applied this week, when Senator Ted Yoho of the Republicans from Florida attacked Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez, Senator of the New York Democrats with incidents and his associates in the Republican Party agreed to attack Lizney, Senator of the Republicans in Wyoming with hostile words.
Deming's Senator discusses the vice-president's office, says Trump hears it for grace
Democrat Val Deming's (democrats) was not ashamed of discussing his interest in serving as Vice President of Joe Biden's possible government and expressing sincere gratitude for being dismissed for the office.
This reputable member of the black party group was interviewing BlackPressUSA on a live broadcast for the #FIYAH! Live show, telling her about her story, the atorney and commitment that has put her in the place she is today, and started with the words "You know all of my story. I grew up as a daughter of a labor woman and house."
Demings was one of the four prosecutors of the House of Representatives in the January trial of Donald Trump in the Senate.
Regardless of whether Trump is indicted, he is the fourth president to be charged.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, the former prosecutor of the House of Representatives said, “Was this worth it? This has been worth every single day.”
She added that despite its disappointment, Democrats would have been obliged to follow the case regardless of its outcome.
In the interview, Demings made clear that she is opposed to Trump’s conviction of Rogers Stone’s prison sentence, which was convicted of lying before the Senate (as well as other crimes) as well as his grace of other offenders convicted of similar crimes, when she said, “The injustice of reaching your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover.”
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden's list of potential candidates for vice-presidents, which also holds former Karen Bass Chairman of the CBC (Democrats, California), Stacey Abrams former Congressman of Georgia, Senators of Camilla Harris (Democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (Democrats), Kellar, Illar
However, she stated that only one person would decide who offered himself with Joe Biden this fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she drew her hand to her mouth while she laughed and pretended to whisper to those who watched the direct broadcast, adding, “If you want to call... then you can do it for me.”
There is no doubt that regardless of the political views of each one, history books will be viewed in this period as a time when the development of American politics and attitudes occurred.
It didn’t happen to Deming.
She recalled that the number of women who are available to the Vice President of the United States is an opportunity to break through what remains of the “glass roof” — especially for women of African origin.
“These are exactly those opportunities that I work so hard for my whole life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they are of the wrong sex,” she said.
The Senate decided to ensure that the Democratic Party and the Biden National Election Team would announce and work with the Black Press of America to get as many people to vote as possible.
“I will call Tom Perez (President of the Democratic Party) and I will put this on my list,” Deming said.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the election.
When she responded to the words of former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he loses the election, and another editorial article that says the president is preparing to reach himself, was alive over Demings: “As much as suggesting to reach himself made me ill.”
But who would ever do that other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It is not possible to break the law and ignore the constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he doesn’t like to lose.
I can absolutely believe that the president will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those in a team that will make it happen.”
Nozzles on foot for children
There are nozzles for children who want to bowl with their parents from an early age in glasses that fit the dining table in better days.
Now, there are probably some parents who are celebrating —or those parents who have got the way to the childish noodles with decorative pictures.
But there are no less children who seek in their parents’ glasses, because they feel more exciting to see on their feet.
We talked about these glasses on modernhouseessentials.com, which contains a variety of gold molars.
The glasses have a good nozzle, a stable leg and withstand good heat - therefore, kids can enjoy the soups, whether hot or cold.
Each glass can accommodate about 150 ml.
Those who want to see the glasses can visit the website HERE, but the glasses are on offer these days in a smaller 3,400 crowns of Icelandic.
Alibaba and Jack Ma tried in Gurugram for a former employee's dear
Gurugram, 26 July: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been tried in Gurugram after the company’s ex-worker claimed he had been fired for protesting censorship and fake news in the company’s applications.
Gurugram and Sonia Sheokand have issued a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and more than 10 others, asking them to attend trial on July 29, according to news.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who worked at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017, is injured by 268,000 US dollars according to the documents.
“We are committed to the Indian market and its employees’ well-being, and its policies are in accordance with applicable law.
We cannot express ourselves about the current proceedings,” UC India said in a statement.
“The lawsuit also contains a “list of sensitive words” containing a Hindi and English password such as “the border between India and China” and “the war between China and India” as stated in the complaint that UC Web uses to censor content on its systems in India,” Reuters said.
Last month, the Ministry of Internal Affairs banned 59 Chinese mobile apps, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with increased tension between the two countries.
A New York City firefighter says it’s “almost” okay to exclude a white firefighter from the honourable
A New York City firefighter says it’s “almost” okay to keep a white firefighter from honor to the flag carriers, everyone can be black, according to a recent report.
White firefighter Daniel McWilliams has appealed for discrimination due to racial discrimination after he was taken from a group of flagrants at a memorial ceremony in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, which is the brotherhood of black firefighters.
In addition, the firefighter in the field of diversity and access, Advocate Cecilia Loving, defended the decision in the hearing of the New York State Human Rights Department.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters in the United States that can be seen to lift the U.S. flag at Ground Zero on the day after the September 11 attacks.
According to McWilliam's dear friend, the fire department had chosen him to be one of the flag carriers at the memorial tour.
Being a flagrant at this ceremony was “a great honor and privilege” for McWilliams, as stated in the trial, according to CNN.
When he arrived at the ceremony, however, he was refused to participate in the honor of the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, because it is alleged that she had asked for all the flagbers at the Mass to be black.
She then asked McWilliams, a 29-year-old New York City firefighter, to help in a different way.
Among the allegations that she has asked him to do is to provide unidentified citizens with an escort and set up peculiar firefighters far from the Mass.
McWilliams claimed in his trial that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the honor because he was not black.
She said it was so, he said.
Wilson, who has worked with the New York City Fire Department for 21 years and who also participated in the rescue work on 11 September, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams claims he abandoned the memorial ceremony “to protect himself from further shame, humiliation and shame,” when friends and colleagues heard what was going on between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When Loving, who is black, testified before the court, McWilliams, a lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked her, "That asking that everyone be black in honor is not a discrimination?"
“No, it’s not,” said Loving, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it was OK to ask everyone to be black in honor, which she replied: “At all.”
Loving explained that it would be okay to replace a white person with a black person to “raise up our uniqueness and different origins to create pride, unity and support for each other.”
McWilliams first filed a complaint on discrimination based on the race of New York City firefighters in January 2018.
He then appealed against Wilson, New York City Fire Department, New York City, and untitled individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams filed his accusation, Wilson's supporters had retaliated and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid hands on McWilliams and said, “I’ve heard of you, they told me you’d behave like this, and now you know who I am.”
In an extract, Sullivan wrote that it would have been “bad” to exclude McWilliams from the honor of the Mass and the evidence that one thing did not apply to everyone at the fire department.
“If you’re a black person and a white person in the workplace, you’ll get the most reminder,” Sullivan said.
Wilson received "consultation for an hour" for her treatment of McWilliams.
In the meantime, a white person who misunderstands a black person receives a “hard punishment,” Sullivan wrote.
“The New York City firefighter has created a strategy and process designed to please members of the Vulcan Society who act racistly, excuse their actions and help them ... and this has to be stopped,” Sullivan wrote.
Walking a walker and demanding money
One was arrested in the city centre after a robbery attempt, in which he threatened the walking passenger and tried to catch money from the person.
The man was saved in a prison cell.
Police reported a man with a knife in the city centre.
The knife was picked up and the report was taken by the person concerned.
More than eighty cases arrived at the police board in the capital area from 17 to 05, and this morning six were saved in a prison cell.
Police stopped, among other things, the driver who pulled a caravan in the caravan where the caravan was in a very bad condition.
The caravan was stationed and the owner intended to provide transportation equipment to transport it to the town.
Then the police stopped drug production in the city.
Two of them were arrested for the case and were released at the end of the report.
There was also an announcement of individuals who launched fireworks in the city.
They had already escaped from the scene when the police came to the place "and probably knew the shame where it is still quite a long way to the end of the year."
Thousands of Khabarovsk residents still demand Pútín's resignation
Thousands of towns clashed with the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday and protested the arrest of the district manager in the southern province of East Russia and the inauguration of his successor, who has never lived in the province.
Former governor Sergei Furgal, enjoys great popularity and tens of thousands of citizens protested when he was arrested and taken to prison in Moscow earlier this month, accused of ordering the murder of three businessmen 15 years ago.
In the last week, Furgal was formally appointed as governor, and his 39-year-old brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, was appointed in his place, with little pleasure from the locals.
Is Degtaryev said unexperienced and, worse, without any connections with Khabarovsk and called the citizens after his resignation the quickest.
They have called Degtaryev as a wind through the ears of rushing.
Yesterday’s protestors were smaller than in the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the salvation of Furgals and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, Russian President.
“We want the governor to be released because we think his arrest is extremely likely to be illegal,” the AFP news agency said after a half-thirds of protestors, Alina Slepovu.
She claims that Kremlar's agents have arrested Furgal "to defend their own interests, not the interests of the province."
The police in Khabarovsk left protestors unarmed even though the claims were a cloudless violation of the current Memorial Prayer due to the Crown virus epidemic.
In Moscow, however, police arrested at least ten people who gathered in Pusjkin Square to show protestors in Khabarovsk support in action, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
Furgals, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is a party of hardline nationalists, and is considered by politicians to be quite dedicated to the Kremlin government in most cases.
The same politicians, on the other hand, inform the BBC that the victory of Furgals in the province presidential elections two years ago — which was great and undisputed — had been a considerable shock for Putin and Unified Russia, and although suggested that Kremlar's capture in the eastern province was weakening.
Furgal was arrested on 9 July and moved to Moscow where he is awaiting trial.
He was charged with three murders between 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were done, but the third went through the duck.
Sarah Rainsford, a reporter for the BBC in Moscow, said Furgals, who enjoys the popularity of homes, convinced that the charges and arrests have political roots.
“They want to know why the government was waiting to arrest him until now,” Rainsford said, 15 years after his alleged breach.
Trees resigned when the orchestra of Hanna rode over South Texas

Homeless women with disabilities participate in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman who is educated as a dresser, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid-smit area in Chennai, where there are reported about 10,000 cases.
The work day starts early at 7:30 and ends at 16 p.m.
It measures the heat of residents, asks about symptoms and teaches them about the importance of using masks, washing their hands regularly, and keeping a distance from others.
Its work has even led to the diagnosis and treatment of contagious infections in a timely manner in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of the 16,000 Chennai City employees who do their homework but are not health professionals.
The project has, according to authorities, contributed to the reduction of positive cases by 50 percent, in the daily number of Chennai, while increasing in other provinces of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says that not all residents are cooperatives.
She adds: “Most people are cooperative when a woman with disabilities approaches them.
Some will be irritated.
This is not to worry about.
I think people should be safe.
When I come back the next day, people are polite.
It helps to build a good relationship.”
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the state of the city for women with disabilities and fight the Covid-19 team.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who also has a disability, has also participated in the campaign as a supervisor.
Although Kavitha has a specially equipped wheel, she goes walking to meet people and keeps her chickens.
“I’m happy,” she says about the reduction of the infection, but adds: “I want to see them go down to maybe about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can get it."
On the first floor of the gistyl where the two live are Matilda Funceca, a basketball woman using a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, and they send all the data received from about 40 women into the Chennai City web server.
Matilda says he is not afraid to be infected by the coronavirus.
“When we help others, God protects us,” he adds.
When Manimekalai is asked what she is doing, she says: “I use a mask, keep a distance, and often wash my hands.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a sidha drink that enhances the immune system."
A few months ago, when the coronavirus first came to Chennai, these disabled women spent their time and ability to seam masks for health care professionals in the city.
Aishwarya Rao, Dr. and Gistory Director, as well as the Dorcas Research Center, who runs the cloud, says: “They adapt to the needs of each moment.
They used to wear masks, and they didn’t leave them.
“It’s time for the community and they responded to the call.”
The coronary virus infection in Tamil Nadu has now become 200,000 after 6989 new cases in the past 24 hours, but it is also the largest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty-nine have died and 7758 have recovered in the past 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206.737.
Police are trying to get to the last trip of a teenager in Helensburgh
Investigators investigating the death of a teenager in Helensburgh are now trying to put together a timeline over his last trips.
The body of 19-year-old Kirk Allan was found at Johnson Court at 6:25 a.m. on Saturday.
A 30-year-old man was arrested and the police confirmed on Sunday that he had now been charged with the death.
He will be in Dumbarton on Monday.
Police officer Steve Martin said: “Our threat is with the family and friends of Kirk at these difficult times.
Police will continue to work with the community and support it.
Our research focuses on getting a full picture of what happened, especially Kirk’s journeys in the last few days before his death, but on the other hand, we are not looking for anyone else in the context of the death.”
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox tell their experience of discrimination
In recent weeks, it has become clear that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racial rights in sports in South Africa.
Constructive conversations need to take place and take action to ensure everyone is welcome in sports.
Ashwell Prince, a former cricket star at Proteas, gave it to his former white teammates and accused them of racial prejudice by telling him and other black teammates to be "vote players".
Prince said the black players of Proteas have been officially named "vote players" by their white teammates.
He added that it would be sad that even though black players like Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada had the top records in the sport, some people still connected to the quota debate.
Prince, now coach of the Cape Cobras team, dropped this comment to the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organizations (UCSCBO) on Thursday night.
The aim of the organization is to continue the fiery discussion of historical racial rights in South African sports.
“As I said when I relieve myself on social media, it’s not my intention to come and draw people’s names down to the area, but these are real incidents.
“You’re doing everything right, but you’re still infecting.”
Paul Roberts, a former musician and builder who became a NASA programmer, is now working with a software company.
He and his wife, a former nurse at the Methodist Hospital who views himself as an optimist, held an online amateur magazine and attended Comic Con events earlier in years.
Once a week, they with their two daughters, a granddaughter and a 7-year-old granddaughter and play a really uno-play.
“They are incredible nerds,” says Roman, 38, about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, aged 65, is aware of the dangers of the global epidemic — she has diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put it at an increased risk.
Her husband has chronic pulmonary disease and stomatitis that keeps a previously blocked coronary artery open.
“We have been so cautious, very cautious, and kept us away from people,” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began to work from home in the spring, when the epidemic fought hard on Washington, New York and other areas around the country.
Paul has been on a supermarket for “old-age” time, and their only real date in the past few months was, according to Sheryl, when they began to look wild flowers through the car window.
Her younger daughter was also very careful.
But then she came freshly home from work day one in mid-June and thought she was allergic.
Soon, she suffered coughing, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all the sense of taste and smell, which are the typical symptoms of the coronavirus.
“She said, ‘I don’t know what’s going on, Mom, but I was wearing a mask, wearing gloves, washing my hands,’” Sheryl said.
“You’re doing everything right, but you’re still infecting.”
Elaine Roberts, diagnosed with a positive coronavirus infection, did not become seriously ill.
The situation got worse with her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife started sneaking and then coughing, just like their daughter, and got so heat and a lot of pain in the body.
“He was sick, very quickly,” Sheryl Roberts said.
On 22 June, he was devastated.
Worried she checked the oxygen level with him.
It was low and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency room for the second time in two days.
The former royal couple found it “shessed” in the Queen’s Christmas tale, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry the Prince of Great Britain found his grandmother, Queen of Britain, to have “shed” them in their Christmas speech.
In the new story of the couple, “Finding Freedom,” it is said that they have been overlooked by those in the gallery that could be seen in the Christmas talk.
Photos on the desk at which the queen sat showed William, Kate Middleton and his three children, Charles and his wife, Camilla, as well as Prince Philip.
But Meghan and Harry were nowhere to be seen despite Archie's birth in May, but the boy was mentioned as the "inspired grandchild" of her Majesty.
The new book, published in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton "were never friends" because they "was hard to get across superficial courtesy" and met only a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that Harry and William's brother began a few years before his relationship and Meghan began, but that it reached the peak due to William's marriage and Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt he was "good" at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, claiming that "he wanted to change things long before Meghan came to history."
The Conservatives are accused of working leaders of wanting to keep officials “home forever.”
Senators of the Conservative Party accused Labour leaders of wanting public employees to be “home forever,” after leaders protested Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work
Labor officers were accused of wanting employees to “stand at home forever” after they protested Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work.
The Conservative Party members were angry when the union of public and general employees told their members to ask their feet when their commanders ordered them to return to their workplaces.
Andrew Percy, former minister, said it was "unacceptable" that the necessary public service, such as the edition of passports, would be a stop while employees in the public market had worked hard to keep the community going in the chronovirus age.
“It is unacceptable that people refuse to return to their jobs while workers in warehouses and factories across the country have continued to work so that officials could eat while this has occurred,” he said.
“Many of these employees now want to go on holiday but can’t because of the people who refuse to go back to their workplaces, even though it’s safe.
“People cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever, especially now that we know people can return to work safely.”
After the summons of the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, the newly appointed director of public service, announced that the ministry was to “resign from the fact that officials work from home, and accelerate their return to their workplaces until 1 August”.
The Public and Public Workers’ Workers’ Association reported to their members, who count about 200,000 people, that they did not have to comply with this requirement, and said this is about politics.
A spokesman for the union of public and public employees, the largest union of officials in the UK, said that the demand for returning to workplaces would not be “not put forward with the health and safety of our members in front of us, or to strengthen the economy.”
This is the only thing done due to the political pressure of the Conservatives, who require public service to be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our recommendations to members are clear: if you do your work at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to the workplace, do not take it, of course, that you have to do it.”
The dispute can be due to growing dissatisfaction with the delayed issue of passports because employees work at home, but about 400,000 people are now said to be waiting for the processing of their applications.
The Ministry of the Interior has now announced that it will "seek to speed up" applications from the UK for travel in the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport release for more than four weeks.
Public and general employees have admitted that some have had to wait for up to 143 days after passports but argue that “little and often narrow offices” make 4000 people of the passport service difficult to maintain the necessary distance.
The ex-minister of the government, David Davis, urged the leaders of the labor unions to “have a sense” and seek leads in cooperation with the government to bring people back into their workplaces.
He added that if he was in government, he would ask a labor leader: “What are you looking for? That people will be home all summer?”
However, some of the UK’s largest companies have also ignored Johnson’s recommendation to return to work.
A study in larger workplaces with a total of 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
The focus of the story can play an important role
The giant has grown, but understanding and reconciliation should be the goal.
The school system is partly responsible for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught by Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only article that specifically deals with our story — “Saga Australia” before the 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in Victoria graduated in Australia’s history of a total of 49,324 who completed primary education, or just 1%.
Over the past six years, this number has almost decreased by half, but nearly 100 fewer students enroll in the course each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about the history of Australia in the 12th grade is that little has been done in the previous years of study to attract their interest.
A story is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the wider “science”.
Therefore, students in the 7th and 8th grade only complete one short unit of “premature and island-shaped trees on the Torres Sun and their culture.”
In the 9th and 10th years there is another unit of Australia during the World Wars.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about the history of Australia during the elementary years.
In the 9th and 10th year, the second optional unit is for the period 1750-1918.
It is important to take three steps to save Australian history at Victorian schools.
First, a story must become an independent study, such as English, Mathematics and Science.
Since a story is only known as a part of human science, it gets little space in the curriculum.
It is usually taught by people who have general education in human science but have not educated themselves in history.
Historical skills such as information analysis are complex.
We need to hire more specialized historians to ensure that such skills are taught in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, the history of Australia from 1788 to 1914 must become a duty.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn the history of Australia in the 12th year of study because they would have had to learn the subject from scratch.
Knowledge of the story alone does not bridge deep gaps between races.
But without it, as can be clearly seen in the Victorian curriculum, the project is hopeless.

Aron Elis in the European Championship - Isaac split by pitch in half
Aron Elís Thrándarson has finished the European Championship final in the Danish Premier League.
Isaac Bergmann Johannesson played only first half with Norrköping's top team against Falkenberg in Sweden.
Aron Elís was a member of OB in Denmark when the team continued to play for the European Premier League.
OB will meet with AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, depending on whether the teams end up above after the final round of the top part of the Danish Premier League later today.
Aaron Elís played the whole game in a 1-1 draw at Horsens in the league today, but OB had won the previous teams at home, 3-1, and therefore won a total of 4-2.
Isaac was in the start of Norrköping, which was unexpectedly 2-0 after the first half against Falkenberg in the Swedish Premier League.
Norrköping made a triple division at the beginning of the second half, and Isaac was one of those who had to depart.
Norrköping scored the score, but Falkenberg reached 3-2 in the 89th minute.
It was still time for Norrköping to recover from hell in the last minute, 3-3.
Norrköping is on the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö that play for good later today.
Falkenberg managed to get out of the bottom in a while, but the team is level above Helsingborg and Kalmar who play for good.
Collecting sources of National Festival in the Crown Viral Times
Anna Lilja Sigurðardóttir founded Facebook the “My National Festival 2020” to collect sources for the national festival that the Islanders are going to celebrate next weekend.
Many will camp in their gardens and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna had a conversation with her on the weekend.
“There’s nothing coming in yet that’s very exciting too because there are 600 people coming into the group so people are clearly going to do something,” says Anna Lilja.
There's something about the islanders going to have campsites at home in the garden.
“Men have talked about being with their own [festival], maybe camping in the garden and hating together the family as they always do at this time,” Anna says.
“You’re expecting people to spend their time with their people.
She says, however, that many people will probably not be there, but still have a little national festival somewhere else.”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to reimburse the purchased tickets, but Anna believes many locals will rather secure a ticket for the next year's festival.
“People are even investing in the tickets for 2021.”
“I’m a great National Festival man, I love the preparation and all around this, but sometimes something comes into life that you don’t control, and that’s just the way it is,” Anna says, “but it’s said that some people have asked if the Islanders can’t let go of the National Festival once.”
Anna Lilja says that she has not founded the group for herself or to encourage people to hold their own National Festival, but to collect sources of shopping festivals in the islands this year.
What did people do in these strange times?
I’m not going to use this in one thing or anything, but then I’m going to identify someone who uses such sources in something but I was just creating some area where people can put in what it’s doing.”
There is also a fire on the lighthouse that is burned every year.
“I think many people are excited to get burned on Friday night.
The only thing that makes a point in the account is that the prediction is not a spes.”
“There will be a fire in this fire, but it will only show how it will be,” said Anna Lilja.

Will Prince Andrew be mentioned in a new document on sexual offences?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in legal documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
US judge has ordered secret documents about Epstein and Maxwell to be made public
Among the things that can be found in these 80 pages of documents are parts with Maxwell's testimony since 2016
The publication of these pages could also put a great pressure on Prince André, where they find communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
In 2015, Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the abusive American financial officer, claimed in court documents that she had been forced to have a relationship with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrés is now preparing to defend the possible disclosure of information this week with even more damaging accusations of his friendship with child abuser Jeffrey Epstein and his supposed academic, Ghislaine Maxwell.
US District Judge Loretta Preska announced this week the publication of 80 secret legal documents in connection with Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundreds of pages.
The publication of these enormous comprehensive documents would be a shock for the 58-year-old Maxwell, where they have a large part of her testimony to lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “questional questions” about her sexual history.
They could also put a great pressure on Prince Andrew, where one of the documents contains communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the abusive American financial officer, claimed in 2015 in court documents that she had been forced three times to have a relationship with Andrés.
Andrés has repeatedly and definitely rejected these statements.
E-mails since 2015 that have been leaked and the BBC published last year seem to suggest that Andrés asked Maxwell to help respond to Robert's claims.
We have no doubt that the Duke will be rebelled.
He said, “Let me know when we can speak, and have certain questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts.”
Maxwell replied, "I have information. Call me when you have a free time."
Last night, a reporter close to Andrés said: “The Duke of Jorvik has done nothing wrong, so we don’t worry about opening legal documents.
As the U.S. courts have claimed to point out, this does not mean that the accusation is true even if it appears in court documents.
The U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to take care of the utmost caution in the treatment of prosecutions presented in court documents.
We totally agree with that.
“We have no doubt that the Duke will have a full revolt in the next few weeks.”
Maxwell is now in custody in Manhattan and awaits trial for finding and enticing some of the victims of Epstein who were under legal age from 1994 to 1997.
She is also accused of injuries for refusing to know about his abuse.
She rejects all the accusations.
Maxwell last spoke to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Roberts' injuries, who is now under the surname Giuffre, whom she took up after her marriage.
About 40 pages of the total of 418 with those testimony were made public last year, but after the verdict of Judge Presna in New York last week, more parts could be opened first on Thursday.
Maxwell's lawyers had a week to appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell last year when he was arrested for sexual offences.
Police are looking for a crime gang for a violent attack on Edinburgh streets
Three attacked a man in Edinburgh and he was injured, which could prove permanent.
The 29-year-old victim was attacked at Drum Street in Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been taken to the Royal Hospital with serious injuries.
Investigator Dale Miles, who runs the investigation, said: “This was a violent and unreasonable attack.”
The suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One of them was thought to be in the forty-four years, about 180 cm tall and strongly grown.
He was short-cut and dark-haired in white trousers, dark pants and dark shoes.
Miles Police Officer said: “I ask everyone in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious about giving up.”
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland, wants to be able to carry a gun in this country and want to increase security.
He is said to have been "sick" about his safety since he arrived in the country last year.
This is reported in the CBS report, which also states that Gunter wants this, despite his work in “a safest state in the world.”
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. Foreign Ministry to conquer the Icelandic government that he may carry a gun.
Then he has asked for a armored car and vest that protects him from stabbing.
CBS officials have reported to Gunter that he is not at risk in Iceland.
According to CBS, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iceland has not provided information on whether a request has been received from the United States for Gunter’s possible ceasefire because the authorities do not state the security measures of foreign foreign diplomats.
However, the authors of the news agency say no request has been made.
CBS has also said that Gunter should not be struggling to carry weapons, because it would be taken as an offense in this country.
Gunter has been a psychiatrist in California for many years.
He is active in the U.S. Republican Party and an energetic supporter of President Donald Trump.
He recently drew attention here in the country when he tied for the “invisible China virus.”
CBS's sources also say that Gunter was severely defeated by the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavík.
He already had seven next-department workers in the embassy from May last year.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to the “Deep Kingdom” so-called, which is supposed to be the network of U.S. officials working against Trump, and resented that one was carrying snow into his office.
The ambassador travelled to Washington, D.C. in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for several months, according to CBS.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but in the end Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, had to order him to return and did so in May.
Jose Mourinho says Tottenham has easier games to play when fans come back to play.
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur hasn’t lost a game at home since the Premier League started again, but he says it’s much easier to maintain a good relay at home if the audience were released.
Spurs has won 12 wins at home during this season, but lost four times - only one of the six teams above them has lost more at home.
The coach of Portuguese said that although such a victory would be possible without the supporters, it would be easier to maintain it if they were on the spot.
“We have to do this with the fans. Without them, you can build some kind of fort where the game program is in the foreground,” he said.
“But I think that much more powerful would be to do it with fans, because then the emotional sides of the game, which is only next with the help of fans in the home stage,” he said.
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the long winning seasons he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up in the past three seasons.
But this is also key to determining whether the teams achieve their goals at the end of the season, especially in equal games and neighboring laws, where the atmosphere on the field can make a difference.
“I think the goal of the Premier League is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to beat this unprecedented record because of what the teams have become good.”
“But it’s important to be strong at home and have at the end of the season picked up a number of points with wins in home games.”
“I’m happy with the finals from the home games recently, without fans, but we need them back.
I see a win against Arsenal with the stadium full of Tottenham fans.
It’s a sense of compassion that is constructed small and small.”
Buyers excited about the demanded lifestyle assets in Lovely Banks
“Greater is better,” is clearly the motto of new owners of huge real estate in the Lovely Banks neighborhood, which was recently sold at 1270 Australian Dollars.
Interested buyers in search of a lifestyle property in the vicinity of the centre of Geelong fled to view this 1,35 hectares of land, where car parks for 14 cars, swimming pool and views of Corio Bay.
Joe Grgic, a real estate salesman in Harcourt, North Geelong, said that a bid in the landowner's possession that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of its launch.

“We got a lot of deals from various sources,” Grgic said.
“The property was sold to a homeowner who is very excited.”
The property includes four bedroom houses on two floors, including a private bathroom that is large enough to accommodate a sofa.
The new owners have a choice of three lounges and can take advantage of a renovated kitchen and updated outdoor area with views of the pool.
“This was about how the property was composed, that it was three fields, and that it was in this place,” Grgic said.
“Then there came interested buyers from Melbourne who were wondering what the property was in the middle but still with a landscape.
“I have people who are missing and buyers who are still looking.”
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and a freestanding shelter that can accommodate 10-12 vehicles, would be perfect for industrialists or to store caravans and trailers.
Their safety is threatened in Iceland.
"Despite being designated as the safest country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been prone to his safety since coming to Reykjavik last year."
This is how CBS News begins to cover the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland, which simulates numerous sources of CBS from U.S. foreign services.
The CBS said Gunter asked the U.S. Foreign Ministry to provide him with a special license from the Icelandic government to carry guns.
He is also supposed to have asked for a armored car, as well as he had thought of a vest that could defend him from a knife stunt attack.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to state publicly whether Gunter's security is actually threatened in Iceland, but according to officials, Gunter has been repeatedly said that he is not in any particular danger.
In spite of this, the U.S. Embassy in Iceland recently announced after lifeguards in full work, including in the morning paper on 18 July, but the sources of CBS say it is done to seduce concerns of Gunter.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs does not express itself on the visceral security measures related to its ambassador, but it always states that the aim of security is to be secured by a preventive means.
The Ministry does not answer any questions regarding Gunter's wish to be armed and the Icelandic Foreign Ministry does not want to tell whether the United States has formally requested that the ambassador bear a gun, and usually does not express himself on the security issues of a foreign embassy.
However, CBS has, according to its Icelandic authors, never made a request for that material, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was acquired from these programs where they could cause an insult to the residents of Iceland.
The CBS coverage also discusses the various issues that have been adjacent to the U.S. Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will have already replaced his landlord seven times.
Thus, the first landlord is said to have prepared for a long time for his work and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the position in the last minute because Gunter “does not read it” at their first meeting.
His successors have not been much better under the control of Gunters.
Presidents of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs are said to be aware of the position in the Iceland Embassy, but are reluctant to intervene in cases related to the President closely bound.
In addition to all of these, Gunter is said to be reluctant to follow the various rules of the foreign service and respect the order of power.
Gunter travelled to the United States in February to attend a conference in Washington, and is said to have refused to return to Iceland afterwards and allowed his temporary localist to do his work for months, and that in the middle of the world history.
Gunter will even have wanted to do his job remotely and will not return to Iceland unless the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, asked for it specifically.
According to information from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take a personal permit to the conference and the crown viral epidemic delayed for him further, but according to the sources of CBS, many within the Ministry will have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he did not have done so until May, following Pompeo's sent back to him and asked him friendlyly to return to Iceland.
The CBS coverage also reports Gunter’s impoliteness in Iceland, especially in relation to titanium as it calls the coronavirus “the invisible China virus” and has received great criticism for it.
Gunter is one of the many, almost unexperienced in the field of foreign service ambassador who has been appointed in the reign of President Donald Trump.
Sachin Pilot v. Ashok Gehlot; Bharatiya Janata Party says government crisis in the state; Congress Party wants a vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if it was needed, the Congress would have to make counters outside the home of Prime Minister.
On Saturday, the day after peaceful protests with Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, the Prime Minister of Rajasthan, said that if it came to be needed, Congressmen would have to meet with the President and make a convention outside the Prime Minister’s home to lead the crisis in the state to smell.
At the Congressional Party meeting, Gehlot suggested that it was intended to hold a vote to check whether the majority of the Congressmans and co-ambassadors were with him in the power struggle.
“He said the government has a majority and wants to go to a vote,” said Mahesh Joshi, the Congress Party’s prime minister, after the meeting.
The parliamentary session was held at a hotel where the Senators supporting Gehlot have remained in the last few days.
“The senior minister asked us to be ready to stay longer in the hotel.
If necessary, he said, he would meet the president and also hold peaceful protests outside the home of the Prime Minister," said the party leader.
Prime Minister Rajasthan can call the Congressional Party together and show its majority, said leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, suggesting that Bharatiya Janata had come up with the recruitment of the Bharatiya Janata Party to overthrow the government of Ashok Gehlot.
“The country is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are created and operate with the people's representatives.
Bharatiya Janata has found out to overthrow Rajasthan’s government.
This is an offense to 80 million Rajasthan residents.
The Prime Minister must call the parliament together to bring the truth before the country," Gandhi said in a statement.
Mr. Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister Rajasthan, told Congressmen on Saturday that he was prepared to go to the President of India to make sure that what he calls "the council of Bharatiya Janata" to delay the declaration of confidence with a vote does not take place.
Gehlot, who protested for several hours with the home of the governor Kalraj Mishra on Friday to push for a parliamentary meeting, met with Congressman and government on Saturday and after the meeting, new proposals were constructed and approved by government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to re-enter the Senate request and refer to six oppositions.
The proposal will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying the session in which he is “under pressure” to delay the vote which determines the trust in his government.
When Gehlot met with his government, the Bharatiya Janata delegation headed the leader of Satish Poonia and the leader of the Gulab Chandra Kataria with the governor to discuss the status of COVID-19 in the state.
In a car just outside the city
There was traffic when a car burned up above the golf course of Hamar at Borgarnes just before four o'clock.
According to the fire department in Borgarnes, the fire in the car was successful in extinguishing the fire, and it is now asked that it be removed.
Two were in the car when the fire burned due to technical failure in the passenger car, both are healed and completely injured.
The traffic was needed during the firefighting period, but heavy traffic is in the area in both directions.
Spencer Grammer, a Canal Outside Manhattan Restaurant
Spencer Grammar said he was trying to calm a man when he cut her arm and put her friend in the back outside a restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, aged 36, told US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation and that they had been trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend sat at the outdoor table at The Black Ant in the East Village district of Manhattan at 23:30
On Friday when a man walked up to them and demanded to get a check, but the restaurant was closed.
Grammer and her friend were injured when they tried to “lease a dispute between an unknown man and other local visitors,” police said.
The man ran off the scene after wounding Grammer's right arm and stabbed her friend into the mug with an unknown odd-wheezing object, police said.
No one has been arrested.
Grammer, who speaks for Summer in the series "Rick and Morty" and previously starred in the series "Greek" on ABC Family, is the daughter of "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both she and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a statement to the US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded at the scene and the Bellevue Hospital staff who admired them and mentioned the “unbelievable struggle” of this staff with the coronavirus epidemic.
“It touched us very much to have the opportunity to thank them in person,” Grammer said.
“I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money.
I'm here to help people" - Chimaev after historic evening at UFC Fight Island - RT Sport News
Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now named as the next UFC star after enrolling in the story of Fight Island, but he says he is not aiming to flag his wealth in a pervasive way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev beat Northern Irish Rhys McKee in their battle in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night when he defeated his competitor after three minutes and 9 seconds had passed from the first round by letting the hits hit him in the floor.
The victory recorded the name of Chimaev in UFC history books for the shortest time between wins in the modern history of the race, where only 10 days had passed since he defeated British John Phillips with similar decisive means, then in intermediate.
Chimaev, a winning 8-0, received a $50,000 U.S. dollar bonus for the performance of the night against McKee, and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now referred to as "Khalib 2.0", which can be said to be an inevitable comparison because of the high likelihood between the superior Chimaev and the UFC champion
Despite the newly discovered fame and financial benefits, the translator Chimaev has said that he would not be eager to flagg his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his peer in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“I’m not just doing it for myself, I’m doing it for everyone I can help.
“I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
“I want to help people,” Chimaev replied when asked on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
Conor McGregor’s teammates, he has worked on Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social media that he could “easily” defeat Chimaev.
There was no poisonous response from the battle cup under the name "Borz" or "wolf" in his native Czech language, which said he would "paint Danis with his eyes closed".
Chimaev, who is now living in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the country at the age of 19, may have little to do with his financial power, but he is clearly unhappy about imparting his fighting skills.
“I can paint anyone...
How many fighters are there?
“I can paint them all,” he said.
“Give me 77 kilos of champion (veltivigt), 84 kilos of champion (millivigt), I grind them both the same day.”
Israel continues to protest the reaction of Prime Minister to world history
JERUSALEM (AP) - Thousands of Israel protested against Prime Ministers across the country on Saturday and were the biggest protests outside the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks, but they began because critics consider the government’s negligence to respond to the coronavirus epidemic after initially managed to keep the threat of the virus in check.
Netanyahu’s allegations of corruption have further pushed the protest.
“Bibi, go home,” stood on the sign of one of the protesters.
He said, “Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes.”
Hundreds of protesters also gathered outside Netanyahu’s beach house in the wealthy city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to scatter groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called the rapid and unorganized reopening of the economy in May, the average number of new cases per day increased up to 2000.
The country's economy has been hit due to the restrictions caused by the virus and unemployment has greatly increased to nearly 20%.
Protesters say the government’s financial assistance is not enough.
The protests took place in the shadow of the trial of corruption charges against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
Interviews begin in January.
He is charged with fraud, defiance, and mutilation in a series of scandals.
Hundreds of protesters gather in downtown Los Angeles to show solidarity with protesters in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) - About 300 protestors gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday in support of two-month-old movements in Portland, Oregon, where attention was paid to federal police officers after a conflict with protestors.
Similar conventions took place throughout the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland and New York.
The protests in Los Angeles were organized by the Refuse Fascism and the Youth Liberation Front.
The group joined the Los Angeles Police Headquarters on First Street and Main Street, and then the main city centre.
The participants also moved to the Alameda Remnants on Highway 101, but left it later.
Part of the people appeared to break windows in federal buildings in the center of the city, and mockery was written on federal markings.
At least one person was arrested in the protests.
50 crowd limits in mosques at the Eid Festival and no prayer gatherings in Eidgah, says the government in Karnataka
The festival Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, will take place on 31 July and 1 August.
The government of Karnataka has announced that only 50 may gather in mosques for prayers due to Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned petitions on Eidgah and other locations due to the coronavirus epidemic.
Guests who want to pray in mosques must wear masks and keep a distance, according to the order from AB Ibrahim, the minister of minority issues and Wakf.
It states that the Hilal Committee has decided that the Eid-ul-Azha Festival, also called Bakrid, should be held on 31 July in the province of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu, but on 1 August elsewhere in the state.
It is stated in the order that even though prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of Muslims at the Bakrid festival, such events will be banned at Eidgah and other places due to the COVID-19 epidemic.
Prayers will be allowed in mosques, provided that no more than 50 are involved at once.
More than that, the council said.
Do not hold prayer meetings anywhere else, such as meeting halls, social centers or Shadi Mahal, as stated.
The Karnataka government allows temples, mosques and other petitions to be opened to those who wish to pray from June 8, provided that the infectious protections for COVID-19 are carefully taken into account.
The US Ambassador Wants Armed Lifeguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland, believes his life is threatened here and wants to walk with weapons.
In early 2020, the U.S. Embassy repeatedly announced the bodyguard in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Kveiks, the main reason why these jobs were announced is that the ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes his life is threatened in Iceland.
Kveikur has spoken to sources in Iceland and abroad who tell the ambassador that he is in great danger and the reason is that he is of Jewish origin.
What the threat is is not as clear, but Kveik's advocates said that Islamic terrorists had been referred to as a threat.
CBS's television station discussed the case on its web site this morning, and reported that Gunter is insane, demands to be able to carry weapons, to get a pole helmet vest, and armed escorts, as well as bullet-proof automobiles.
According to CBS, Gunter has been repeatedly said that there is no threat and that the “bodyguard” advertisement is only to seduce Gunter.
According to Kveiks, the positions had not been hired in the end of June, but the application deadline expired in February.
According to Kveiks, no formal statement has been received from the U.S. Embassy due to these changes.
Neither has been formally requested for increased protection nor for authorization for the lifeguards to be armed outside the embassy's walls.
Icelandic law determines that this is not permitted unless by a special authority of the State Department.
Inside the system, Kveiks interviews say no information is available about any kind of threat.
The state's latest risk assessment is quite decisive about terrorist threats.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence that terrorist or extreme groups work here.
The prerequisites for permitting the armistice of a foreign embassy on the streets of cities and towns in Iceland are, according to the sources of Kveikur, not present.
Gunter drew considerable attention in this country when he split the tenth U.S. president and called the COVID-19 "China virus".
After that, he had the flag of the United States and the Icelandic flag.
A radio broadcaster in Seattle who was afraid of Trump’s reaction to protests says he now needs a gun after a Starbucks cafe below his apartment was destroyed — RT USA News
Paul Gallant has received a new perspective on violent protests after hoping for President Donald Trump in June for saying that anarchists were burning and robbering Seattle City.
The only thing I needed was to get closer to the house of the director.
“I feel like I need to buy myself a gun because this will clearly continue to happen,” Gallant said on Saturday night after he saw that damaged wolves had “destroyed” the Starbucks café on the bottom floor of his multi-storey house.
“Now it’s enough. It looks like a street party down the street from me. Very angry now.”
Trump complained last month that the Mayor of Seattle was allowing violent protestors to take over the city.
“These liberal Democrats are insane,” the president said.
“The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they think it’s just wonderful, even death.”
Gallant, a co-director of the show “Danny & Gallant” at ESPN’s Seattle collaborative radio station, responded with a thrill: “Go through there for curiosists last night and saw no burns, robbery or deaths. Relax salmon.”
Gallant said the police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks café.
He posted pictures of the damage and said, "Well done, idiots," and noted that he had also seen a fire on a few sides of the house.
“I don’t know what’s going on, but we’re going to find out.”
The reversal did not pass people who were appalled to Gallant for his previous opinion and tweeted messages such as “Just relax on salmon,” and “Yes, maybe Trump was right.”
Jason Rantz, a radio broadcaster in Seattle, said, “I don’t think we’ll finally go on this tour that we talked about.”
Gallant replied, “Wake up and saw that a lot of people were tiring for “relaxing on salmon” to me.
He said he was standing by his previous assertion as he had walked through the Chaz autonomous area of anarchists, and although it wasn’t as bad as it would have been claimed.
“So there was fire and robbery after all,” he said.
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, in an apartment search with her 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, joined together at the scene of the show White Lines, which deals with the succulents and slugs on Ibiza, but in the housing search over the past week, their perception was second and quieter, away from the enjoyment of the party island.
The couple, who plays siblings in the popular Netflix series, were seen viewing an impressive Oxfordshire farmhouse, which is for sale at £1.2 million.
They met in the Range Rover area, which Laura, 34, occupied, dressed in jeans and white trousers, and met with real estate agents who led them on a tour of the five-room house.
In White Lines, which was recorded last autumn, Laura played Zoe Walker, who meets the darker side of Ibiza when she investigates the murder of her brother, the album novel Alex, the game of Tom, aged 28.
Their relationship was not discovered until this month, within a year from the end of Lauru and Sam Claflin's six-year marriage, but he is known from the Hunger Games films.
Together they have their four-year-old son Pip and their two-year-old daughter Margot.
When they announced the divorce in August last year, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: “I Laura have decided to divorce. We understand in love, friendship, and with deep respect for each other, and will continue our cooperation in raising our children.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 in an audition test, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, declared their wedding in 2013 as “no doubt one of the greatest achievements of my life.”
Prior to Laura's role in White Lines, she had played in the first Inbetweeners film, and in the BBC crime drama The Capture, which was shown last year, where she played the lawyer Design Roberts.
Tom starred in the second Inbetweeners film and in the series Brittania from Sky.
I think it’s too early to talk about other people here.
An expert at the medical department says too early to argue about the other wave of the epidemic.
Three new inland attacks were detected at the virologic department of the Landspítalian yesterday and tens of people have been diagnosed.
Two domestic attacks were detected on Thursday, one with a man aged thirty and the other with a man aged twenty.
There was no infection since the beginning of the month.
Last week, another three domestic teams were detected, one of which had been at the Rey Cup in Laugardal.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, a police officer, said in an interview with the news agency that fewer had to be taken for the contagion, but originally thought.
The second infection is with an individual who came to the country from abroad on 15 July.
Then, the rules of the so-called return mystery were taken into effect.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert at the Medical Service, says that the person on the other hand has been following the old process.
His vision was negative at the time of his arrival in the country, but he was then ill, in isolation and had six incarcerated.
They are all on their way to a test, but two of them are starting to show symptoms.
The third infection is then linked to the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and has been placed in an epidemic related to it.
It has been found that, on the way, new variants of the coronavirus that have not been diagnosed before in this country.
“We don’t know exactly where this virus is coming from, but we haven’t seen it before.
He who is believed to have carried the virus to the land had been in Israel but also in other European countries."
It feels too early to claim that the so-called second wave of the epidemic has begun in this country, as other countries in Europe fear.
“While the majority is still traceable, it is not eaten to do so.
But we're on our toes and we're watching, thinking about ways to react if something that could start."
Megan Fox talks about the relationship.
Megan Fox claims to have found his twin soul in the rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
“As soon as I met him and looked in his eyes, I knew.
I’m interested in starmarks and I immediately knew that my twins were talking about,” says Fox, aged 34.
“The twin soul is when the soul has reached a high level of existence so that it can split into two different bodies at the same time,” Fox explained.
“We’re two half the same soul, I think.
I told him that as soon as we met.
I found it right away.”
“When we had known him for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch and I taught him about the starsigns and asked him out in his life.
“I decided to go to the depths right away.”
Machine Gun Kelly takes on the same string, but they met on a film.
“I started hanging outside her caravan and was hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Just two months ago Fox divorced his husband to ten years old, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim
American musician, fashionist and presidential candidate Kanye West have apologised to Kim Kardashian West for his statements that he was publicly detained in the private affairs of his family.
“I want to apologize to my wife Kim for discussing private matters publicly,” he tweeted.
Much has been speculated about the status of their relationship, but Kanye has recently been a great deal on social media and at a crowd meeting that he held last Monday he talked among other things about the birth of his daughter North West and said he almost killed her.
Then Kim stepped up on Wednesday and posted a message to his followers on Instagram, discussing her husband’s disease, but he is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously spoken publicly about her husband’s illness and said it was because of their children and Kanye’s right to privacy when it comes to his health.

Protests against racial rights in the United States
Protesters have walked through the streets of numerous cities in the United States to draw attention to racial rights.
In Portland, Oregon, after May 25, when George Floyd died in a prison in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent federal police officers to Portland, which is still under protest.
Protesters also object to the reality of the federal police officers in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, police used flash bombs and tear gas and arrested 45 people after a protest meeting in support of the protests in Portland dissolved into violence.
Police said more than 20 police officers were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was launched into the Black Lives Matter claim.
The media said the man could have walked up to a vehicle armed rifle before he was shot.
“The essence of the case is that it is terrible that someone should be put to death in protest,” said Austin’s Mayor Steve Adler.
Adler said, "Share beaten and wordless."
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed protestors demanded justice in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with permission to enter without a bank, and shot her.
Taylor's girlfriend had first shot the police officers because he thought they were a burglar.
One police officer has been fired for Taylor's death, but the other police officers have not been arrested.
The NFAC group, an armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in the police investigation of Taylor's murder.
According to police, three members of the NFAC were injured on Saturday when a shot accidentally ran by a gun at the rebel troops.
Potential group infection in seclusion
Five people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 this week outside the border line.
Two of the infected were diagnosed with the previously unknown varieties of the virus and appear to be quite vague.
It is unclear whether the individuals have been infected by a tourist who has returned from a country or an unequivocated Iceland, who has then probably infected a lot more.
The local surgeon says that a possible group infection may be in seclusion associated with one of the infections.
Two people were diagnosed with Covid-19 on Thursday, with either type of virus.
The origin of the infection is still unclear.
Three were diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by another of those diagnosed on Thursday, another arrived in the country on 15 July, and probably infected outdoors, but the third is also infected with a vague origin.
After a series analysis of the Icelandic gene analysis, it was found that the two individuals who were diagnosed with the virus and related are with her new variants that have not been diagnosed before in this country.
Kamilla Josefsdóttir, a specialist in the field of disease prevention at the Department of Veterinary Medicine and a substitute for the disease physician, says that Icelandic genetic analysis is now going over where it is most likely that this type of virus has come from.
“Another case was similar to a virus that has been running in Switzerland but still not quite the same.
They’re going to look at this and try to map it better and lead the likes from which part of the world the infection comes,” she says.
"It seems to be on the Atlantic side."
As a result, the two infected people were disconnected from the United States at the beginning of July.
Do you assume that this new species has come to the outside rather than having mutated here in the country?
“Yes, it’s different from what’s been found here before that there’s really no chance that this has been something to grind here,” Kamilla said.
“Christmas are all probable that these individuals have somehow gotten to a person who has just arrived somewhere from outside, without knowing it himself.”
She said there is no evidence yet of where this new virus could have come from.
“Of course, there could be a traveler who has left the country again, but there might also be someone who does not get symptoms and does not realize that he has been infected and then, of course, could cause more infection.
We’ll be on our toes for the next few days to watch it.”
“There’s no such thing as a smart group infection.
“But there are individuals who went to an epidemic in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have already gone to a sampling,” Kamilla continues.
“We haven’t had any results yet.
It could be a group infection.”
Do you think it’s a community now?
“It is not impossible.
It has not been recently, but it is not impossible because we do not know who has carried this infection in these individuals, who were detected on Tuesday and yesterday,” she replied.
Could I tell you that there is a new wave of the virus?
“No, not yet.
But, of course, we need to be very well alert, and we need to keep in mind that even though there are so certain limits to how much we can take in people’s eyes.
“We don’t take samples from unconscious people, but first we’re getting infection that seems inconspicuous, we need to be given a little looser hands with taking samples from people with symptoms,” she says.
In the next few days, you can expect to provide an antibiotic and virologic department in the exhibitions to try to better map the situation here.
Does the hospital have the ability to increase samples domestically and take care of screenings at the border?
“Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there must be some basis for taking samples in individuals who are not in the screening mechanisms; the person must be in an inconvenience and show symptoms or have had symptoms and suspicion of having gotten into the face of someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that,” Kamilla says.
She concludes that an infection is still in progress in the infections that were detected yesterday and that there is a lot of work going on to obtain information about the individual’s journeys.
It says that the origins of the inland insects seem inconclusive, but it does not exclude that some of those who have now been placed in the tract could provide evidence that ultimately leads the infectious team to the original insects.
The restaurant that most people know about, but one of the best
Not everyone is sure where the restaurant Bjargarsteen is located and certainly has more fans abroad than here in the country if you can refer to it on TripAdvisor and other sites.
There have been people who have fled to the country to visit him would not be surprised.
Berglind Hreiðarsdóttir, food blogger and cookbook writer, rushed at Bjargarstein in the days and kept water from impressive
“I don’t know where to start because the restaurant Bjargarsteen at Grundarfjörður is a wonderful place.
The history of the house is one of the most beautiful things I know, the food up to ten, the view not from the worse end and the wonderfully entertaining servants,” says Berglind.
“Gun, the owner of Bjargarstein, magiced every delightful dish on the feet of others before us.
My wife and I sat with our girls for a whole night to eat so it must tell us how good the food was,” Berglind adds.
“The house in which the restaurant is fired is an old apartment house that was transported whole way on Grundarfjörður.
Current owners drove the eyes of this house for sale at Akranes, found a beautiful sea plot at Grundarfjordur and made the dream come true.
You can read more about the history of the house on the Bjargarstein website.”
“The houses and all the houses on the rock are unique.
We have gathered together memories from the whole family, and it really puts its bang on the house.
On the top floor is a lounge and really cosy and homely to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and the cooking then do not hide and it is obvious that much is put into the magic of tasty and beautiful dining," says Berglind and is the mark of the pictures is no lie.

Green was a founding member of this historic rock band along with former Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Although Green left the band in 1970, before reaching her peak with albums such as Rumours, Mick has praised this former band member and assured fans that "his music will continue."
“For me and all former and current members of Fleetwood Mac, it’s losing Peter Green a lot of memorial,” Fleetwood said.
“Peter was the man who founded the band Fleetwood Mac with me, John McVie and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined Fleetwood Mac without having deep respect for Peter Green and his abilities, and the fact that the music should shine brightly and be moved by unpleasant passion.”
“Peter, I’ll miss you, but make sure your music will live,” the 73-year-old rock star added.
“Thank you for asking me if I wanted to be your drummer for all these years.
We worked well and had a good musical career that so many of us have enjoyed.
“God be with you, dear friend, with love and respect, Mick Fleetwood.”
Green's death was confirmed in the statement of Swan Turton: "Peter Green's family announces with great sadness that Peter died this weekend, peacefully in his sleep.
Further statements will be published in the next few days."
Green leaves a daughter, Rosebud Samuels-Greenbaum, whom he had with his ex-wife, Jane Samuels.
Green founded Fleetwood Mac with Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, the band was originally named "Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer".
The singer left the band in 1970, after four albums.

The Prince of Joachim said constant
Prince Joakim, the younger son of Margaret Thorhild, and Prince Henry, is still in a hospital in Toulouse, France, where he went into action last day due to blood clots in the brain.
The Danish state radio, DR, has, according to the Danish herd's spokesman, not known how long the 51-year-old prince will be in the hospital, but his well-being remains stable.
The DR said it is now investigating the effects of the blood clot on the Prince’s health.
It has been reported by Dr. Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who is discussing health issues for DR, that the consequences of brain blood clots often do not occur until 24 hours after surgery.
“It can be anything from insignificant symptoms to paralysis, memory problems or difficulty in expression,” Geisling says.
He says that the prince could wait for many months of rehabilitation.
Joachim the Prince of Denmark, named Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and also the Count of Monpezat, stayed at the family's vineyard, Château de Cayx in southern France when he was ill on Friday night.
He was first taken to a hospital in the town of Cahors, a short distance from the farm, and then moved to the University Hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent surgery due to blood clots in the brain.
Google Pixel 4 can create the galaxy
The double optical zoom allows the extra lens of Pixel 4 to be seen in three dimensions and thus delivers a better assault in the background with a face image mode than in previous Pixel phones, which relied entirely on the software to achieve these so-called “bokeh” effects.
To show the quality of the camera, Google got mythical photographer Annie Leibovitz on stage to discuss his experience of photography with Pixel 4 in the last 12 months.
Engineering is still at the forefront of all aspects of Google’s new smartphones, and on this phone, “computer-controlled photography” is used to improve HDR+ mode by combining up to nine different images.
New dual lighting controls offer different slides for brightness and shade, allowing users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on machine learning to offer better automatic whitening and enhanced “Night Sight” night setting, which is so sensitive that it can capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
In addition to other camera sensors, Pixel 4 Soli introduces a radar chip microphone on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense movements so that users can drop a track, turn off time measurements, put a alarm on a blush or turn off the phone's sound by waveing their hand.
All Motion Sense calculations are carried out on the device instead of connecting to the Internet, and the same applies to improved Google helpers, since the technology is now focusing on shortening response time and improving the privacy of users.
Google’s continued emphasis on utilizing its machine learning capabilities has also resulted in a new voice recording app that transcribes audio live without transmitting data to the internet.
The app is currently available only in English but more languages are available.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadia, a cloud-based game platform to launch on November 19 in the United States, but still be announced on a date for Australia.
In addition to new Pixel phones, Google also introduced a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and second generation Google Pixel Buds headphones.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing aids, which are available next year, are completely wireless and have a sound adaptation that listens to the environment and continually adjusts the sound accordingly in order to make the clarity the greatest.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing aids are completely wireless and adjust the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also announced updating its connected Wi-Fi home bees in the Nest WiFi line with a special leg, along with many base locations that work together to improve wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest name, doubles its predecessor’s range and adds built-in microphones and speakers to use the Google helper at each base of the home.
It goes on sale in Australia on 5 November and costs 399 Australians for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or 549 dollars for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but the new 79 dollar Nest Mini improves the sound quality by double the bass and has received a built-in wall fixation.
All Google smart speakers will receive new call system features for communication between devices in your home as well as the ability to call Nest Mini outside your home with the Google Home app.

Lecce is four stages behind Genoa, which is in the 17th place and is one game ahead.
"People want to throw a beer bottle in seal" in Devon
The hunter threw a beer bottle into the seal when he interrupted the hunting line, according to a charity organization.
Photographs taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay appear to show a person on a rock that throws an object towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey seal had been hunting when the rod hunter drew out of a bottle and threw it in the back of the animal.
Kenny called it “a horrible and unreasonable behavior.”
He said he was picking up junk at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning along with other people in the Seal Project when he witnessed the attack.
“Selen tried to get to the hunting line,” he said.
“The bar hunter stretched the beer, drained the bottle and threw it into the seal.
"The bottle fell on the back of the seal and he swam away."
Teacher said that "fortunately there were seals of strong-built animals" but that the seals had simply been doing what would be natural to him.
“By throwing a glass bottle into him, you’re stopping him on his hunting,” he said.
The Seal Project Company said it was “not a unique incident” and that it had just received “a lot of announcements about this aggressive behavior.”
The company’s Facebook post says that its volunteers collected 12 bags of trash in the collection at Hope’s Nose on Sunday and that “a lot of examples of antisocial behavior” had been seen.
All sellers enjoy protection under the law on the protection of sellers and people are asked to stay away from them.
Ascension from Christianspolli in Laxá in Dollars
The first hundred-year-old hunted in Laxá in the valleys later today.
There was the work of Arnór Ísfjörður Guðmundsson.
This morning, he was in a cave at Kristnapolli, and she was 89 inches.
At noon, he was re-evaluated at Kristnapolli and was thought of a story that he had heard that the slowness would tend to notice that the chicken had been hunted.
With this in mind, he went with a Collie Dog coupon and threw over Kristnapoll.
Soon he got caught and as he tells himself.
“After five seconds, he was completely cleaned up and I realized it was the record.
I was stressed because I had 11 pounds.
Usually I got caught on fish, but I had this one for 40 minutes.
In fact, he was quite comfortable.
I took a few trips up and down the pollen, but then I managed to strand him and it was a wonderful feeling.
I cried off the pole and jumped on it.
He measured 102 centimeters, and I twinned him," said a cheerful hunter in the hunting house Thrandrill in Laxá in Dalar in a conversation with Scorpio.
No one starts when it comes to hundreds.
It was his 8th.
He had such fish in Blend, Svartá, Hraunsfjörður, Kjarrá, two in Langadalsá and one in Eystur Rangá.
A good hunt is in Laxá in Dölum, according to Arnór.
The cave that finishes at noon tomorrow comes with 35 salmon and our husband has eighteen of them.
Expect a lot of flooding because of Hannah.
Hanna, the first Atlantic orchestra this year, landed in Texas.
Hanna quickly lost power and became stormy, but despite this, heavy rain has occurred in the area and is expected to be a massive flood.
It is expected to rain up to 30 centimeters in one day, but in special locations it could reach up to 46 centimeters, according to the AP news agency.
Especially is warned about dangerous hurricanes that could occur due to the rain.
The area where Hanna reached land has been hit due to the high distribution of the new crown virus there.
In addition, the sea has gone on land and caused damage.
At least 43,700 people are now unelectrified, and there have been mass relief stations in the area.
US President Donald Trump tweeted about the casualty last night and said it’s important that people listen to experts and follow instructions.
Below you can see the photographs that the AP's photographer captured this morning.
Houses burned, shops robbed and infrastructure damage
More than sixty more are killed and sixty more injured after an assault in the village of Masteri in Darfur Province in Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in a series of serious security incidents in recent weeks where houses were burned, shops and markets robbed and infrastructure damaged,” according to a statement from the United Nations Humanitarian Office in the capital of Carthage launched today.
Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has announced that security forces will be sent to the province to "protect inhabitants and harvest".
Only two days ago an unknown force in the region killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack.
“Augmentation of violence in different parts of Darfur province is leading to increased deterioration, it jeopardizes agriculture and threatens people’s lives and livelihoods,” the United Nations said.
The conflict in Darfur, in the western part of Sudan, began in 2003 when rebels, mostly Arabs, rose up against the governor of Carthage.
The forces of government and Arab troops who tried to put down the revolt have been accused of widespread harm, but some 300,000 were killed in the conflict according to the United Nations.
Omas al-Bashir, who was cast by a chairman of Sudan's leader, is called upon by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocides and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, new Sudanese governments are now trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
TV News Woman Thanks The Viewer for Taking Carcinoma
TAMPA, Florida (AP) - TV newswoman in Florida thanks the observer's attention for noticing a knot on her neck and sending her an email that she should have him checked.
Victoria Price, a reporter at WFLA in Tampa, went to this advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price said on Twitter that she went to surgery on Monday to get rid of the tumor, thyroid and some lymph nodes.
"The doctor said it's spreading, but not too much, and we're hoping this will be my first and last action," she said.
The viewer sent Price an email last month and said that the node reminded her of the node she had had.
A 28-year-old research reporter, Price, said this week that her television station’s slogan was “8 on your side.”
“But the roles recently changed when the viewer was in team with me and I couldn’t be more grateful,” Price said.
“I will forever be grateful to the woman who made a move to send me an e-mail, a completely strange woman.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did.
Talk about being with someone.”
Part of Jeronimo Open Space's outdoor space closed temporarily after two attacks - CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by a plain wolf near the Oso Creek road on the Jeronimo road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and closed the road temporarily.
Laura Wittmer says she sees a wolf almost every morning and usually tries to avoid them just, but on Saturday morning one came straight to her and bite her in the foot.
The route has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
Mission Viejo City reported: “Today, two different partners announced that a plain wolf had bitten a person. The mission Viejo’s animal welfare service is working on the issue in cooperation with the fish and wildlife department, and parts of Jeronimo Open Space have been closed. Show care and be at your watch when you’re on a busy journey.”
Wittmer tried to beat the wolf off with a water bottle.
She called the emergency line to get a ride to her car, but she could drive to the emergency room herself.
The wolf disappeared in the slopes, but officials hope to be able to drive him and test him for dogs.
Wittmer will be treated for dog disease as a precaution for the next two weeks.
She said that this awesome incident would not keep her from the morning races but that from now on she would choose another place.
The situation of the person who was bitten is not clear.
Protestant racial hatred faces police in Seattle
The conflict in Seattle on Sunday between police and protestors against racial hatred ended with the arrest of a number of people, but the dissatisfaction among the public due to Donald Trump's plans to send a number of federal police officers into major cities.
The protests against racial hatred and police violence have occurred following George Floyd's death, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis in May.
Protesters in the Seattle cave on wheeled cars and broke windows in caravans at the protests on Saturday, causing police to declare a state of disruption and draining the streets with pepper sprays and flash bombs.
Protesters also fired caravans on a construction site for expected teenage prison.
Police said they arrested 45 people, but 21 police officers were injured.
The protest was held in support of the protests held in the neighbouring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is at the forefront after Trump ordered extreme radical actions by federal police, in unthanks to local authorities, who say police are using excessive authority.
Contests have been held in Austin, Texas, and Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha and Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of Texas, one was shot dead in armed conflicts in the center of the city on Saturday night, according to police.
Alongside the protests, Trump has increasingly struggled for re-elections in November, and has committed to a harsh law enforcement policy.
