Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently dismayed by a proposal to change the name of a assembly member or AM (member of the Assembly) to a member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came due to plans to change the name of the parliament of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they can be laughed.
A Labour member said his group is concerned by your "MWP rims on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means foolish and "pwp" beech.
A Plaid Party member said that the group "is not happy" and has suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an "open mind" in terms of the name change, but added that the MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, now writing bills to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on which members of the National Assembly will be called, of course, will be up to the members themselves."
A 2017 Welsh official decision empowered the National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the naming proposals which demonstrated great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the National Assembly members, the delegation prefers Welsh Member of Parliament or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The National Assembly members have apparently made other suggestions, but the struggle to be united has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, headpieces. She is going to submit the bill in a couple of weeks.
The legislature of the reforms contains other changes for how the delegation should work as well, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on what to name when debating the bill.
Macedonians voice in referendum to change the name of the country
Electoral voters are going to run on Sunday if they are going to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was decided to resolve a conflict that has taken place for many decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring north represents a claim to the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the renaming, said he is going to disregard the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin silence while the churches of Harlem, New York, struggle
"The old I've been talking to said that in the old days there was a bar and a cow on every corner," Adams said.
"Today none of the parts existed."
He said he understands why the bars disappear.
"People socialize in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Children are no longer studs in the neighborhood that people visit as usual."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the property will not last as long as the leaders believe, "and sooner or later they are back where they started."
He added that cows can be replaced by share apartments filled with the type of people who don't care about helping the historic sites in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority who buy share apartments in these buildings are white," he said. "and so comes the day when all the cows are closed, because it is not likely that these people moving into the share apartments will become members of these cows."
Both churches were built of white socks before Harlem became a black township - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin church a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black parish that had preached nearby, moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black parish led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also hired the boycott of the shops in 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem where the owners opposed to adding or promoting blacks.
The building suffered heavy damage in a fire in 1939, but when Reverend Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor of Saint Martin, was proud and called the bell game "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played on the bell game in July called it something else: "One cultural treasure" and "an historic instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first bell game in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who leaves the church to play on the larger bell game in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin could not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Saint Martin over the past few months has become a complicated story about architects and building workers, some of which have been added by the leaders of the playpeople in the church, and others of the Episcopal Diocese.
The sacristy, which leads the parish and consists of the leaders of the lay people, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would ask the sacristy to pay," though the sacristy was not involved in the diocese's addition of architects and building workers.
Some of the members of the parish have complained of the lack of openness from the diocese.
13-year-old injured by shark during bumper diving in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for bumps in California on the opening day of the bumps season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. in the morning near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help. He paddled away to the boy with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that first he thought only the boy was thrilled to have caught a bump, before he realized that the boy shouted "something bite me!
Something bit me!"
"His whole collar bone was ripped off," Hammel said he observed when he reached the boy.
"I cried that everyone had to get out of the water: It's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was taken by air ambulance and taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It is not known what kind of shark it was like undoing the boy.
Bath guard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was being observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious damage to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and safe the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
The Sainsbury's shopkeeper invests in beauty products
The British shopkeeper Sainsbury's is to compete with the Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams' beauty products and offer department store services in the store.
As part of an investment in Britain's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow as the fashion and interior halls go down, Sainsbury's is to test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and more stores if it becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that pledged to be full of TVs, microwaves, and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they should double the number of beauty products to 3,000 products and offer the Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw brands for the first time.
They should give the L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand such as in the Boots stores.
The store should also relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and make most of the products vegan, which should attract more young customers.
In addition, perfume dealer Fragrance Shop is scheduled to test the sale of their perfumes in two of Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second is scheduled to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Action online and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small stores, means large shopkeepers need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing leader of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like department stores, while the shopkeepers are trying to fight the low-priced Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has merged with the Argos interior chain in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims this has increased the food room and so defended the acquisition.
The shopkeeper's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but this became an end to when the parties did not agree on how to share the profits from the pharmacies in the stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold pharmacy chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacies and owned the Lloyds pharmacy chain, £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still have a role to play and are to offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including labeled La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty shelves will look and be experienced to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special expertise to be able to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of acting."
Peter Jones "rasing" after Holly Willoghby withdraws from deal worth £11 million
The star from the TV program Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "rasing" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement with his lifestyle brand worth £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to promote their interior and worship mark Truly.
The couple's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host from the program This Morning, 37, made the news known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, amid the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on his own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "rasing" when the golden Holly confessed during a strained meeting on Tuesday at Jones' headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - means she no longer has time to collaborate on the interior and related Truly brand.
The collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make known that she should not work with Truly, while Jones escaped Britain to calm down in one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was certainly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed his own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to the launch.
There is a Marlow warehouse filled with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the decision of This Morning host, which is one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions due to fierce investments in products, from pillows to candles to clothing and interiors, and can cause delays with the launch.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the Truly brand along with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman of the board in March.
Para vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin hosting ITV's program I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Hard conversations "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media to make a comment someone could experience as "unresident" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his customs vote as a "news speaker".
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the demolition of the North Korea nuclear weapons program.
But the negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat from North Korea said Ri Yong Ho to the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "responsive response" from the United States on the occasion of North Korea's early degradation.
Instead, he added, continuing the United States with sanctions to push North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's going great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relationships with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, help in the release of hostages and the return of the layovers of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure in terms of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had around 200 people standing right there," Trump said pointing to the group standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroys island and kills hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were told there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok residents had to flee, no one declared the national emergency state, which is necessary for international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they do not want international help, so it's a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
As the Save Children assemble a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain if added with foreign passports are allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the Bureau for National Crisis in Indonesia, said that authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to offer emergency aid.
Although Indonesia is subject to earthquakes often, the country is not particularly prepared for the natural forces.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, most likely leading to more victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is by default quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was docking in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the betternga of Indonesia's infrastructure during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railroads.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for President Joko's administration, and next year there are elections again.
President Joko is also being pressured in terms of sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets and used machetes, arrows, and archers, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking him up and towards the goal.
The attempt sealed high above the penalty field and fauk against the right upper corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball fell over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the goal.
"I was just trying to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq are trying to get as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and losing the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball."
Chelsea hired 1-0 after the break after the score in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Prior to the goal, Hazard gave Mateo Kovacic the ball before spanning off near the midfield into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic took the ball quickly on the midfield.
Then he shot it in a delightful way and hired Hazard into the penalty field.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defense and scored with his left foot right past keeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool is to play against Naples in the Champions League group stage at 15 a.m. on Wednesday in Stadio San Paolo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is to play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15 a.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of victims in Indonesia tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims of the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the country's emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, which occurred on Friday and had a magnitude of 7.5 followed by 6 metres high waves, reported the spokesman for the emergency agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.

Parliament statue of Cromwell becomes the last victim of the "rewriting of history"
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious artifacts in England that his Puritan followers did during the 17th century civil war.
However, the Cromwell Federation described Crick's proposal for the removal of the statue as "noisy" and "an attempt to write about history."
John Goldsmith, the chairman of the Cromwell Federation, said: "It was inevitable in the debate in question about the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was either ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinions in the 19th century, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still think it is worth celebrating."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, seen as a defender of parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, it was against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not, is still a topic of discussion in historical debate.
What is certain is that in the mid-17th century the conflict has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of that distinction.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Mordargris attacks and kills Chinese pawn
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, surname Yuan, was found dead, with cut artery and covered with blood, near a pig binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines on a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the gate of one of the pig binges was open.
He said that in the bing there was a large male pig with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kilograms heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and destroyed," said his cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
Monitoring camera shows that Yuan arrived on the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while police gathered evidence of the scene.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Although rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, giving the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kilograms heavy pig held a Welsh pawn trapped between him and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News reported that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can trimmed the animals.
"They just want to play.
They like to bite a little, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa brings rain to southwestern United States
As predicted in the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker across the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Yet Rosa will carry cow rain to northern Mexico and southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had wind speeds up to 136 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 until 5:00 p.m. in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure forms across the Pacific Ocean moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa arrives closer to the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity north to southwest United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react at low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can cause dangerous embarrassment and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will result in rains of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the southwestern United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous embarrassment can occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It is warned against hikes in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can turn gaps into embarrassing rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong wind and dust.
The upcoming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast in southern California.
Total rainfall of over 1 centimeter is possible, which can create small embarrassments and smooth roads.
This will be the first rainby for the season in the region.
Spreaded tropical rainbyes will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain rises late on Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can wait a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October may testify intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic becomes colder, but tropical regions will still be quite hot.
Some times this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start on October, with 25 degrees and upwards from southern part of the large plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term forecast indicates that there are high chances of over average temperatures in the eastern United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million views Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman accusing him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different TV channels.
At the same time, the political discussion around the case continued, interrupting the regular television programs of various broadcasting companies to reveal the latest news on Friday: a unity reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the charges in the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court committee that she is 100 percent sure Kavanaugh confronted her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sense of dismissal, that he is 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the aberration on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not clear from other channels showing the right, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, there is a similar number of viewers watching an American football final or the Oscars.
Fox News hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with the most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
The ABC was second 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, a moderate Republican, declared that he is on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants shouted for him on his way to a hearing with a referee committee on Friday.
He stood and looked in the ground for several minutes while the Protestants shouted at him on CNN live.
"I stand here right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you believe he tells the truth of our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office has spoken out, and before entering the elevator he said he wanted more to say under the committee hearing.
Broadcasting agencies showed the hearing on television when the referee committee would vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to full-seat Senate and further bribery.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh during the next week, which Democrats have also requested.
Flake was partly told after talking to his friend, Democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not voice Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May blames critics for "playing politics" in the case of Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, blames critics for her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with the future of Britain with no regard to national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on September 29, 2018.
Alongside the interview with May on the front of the Sunday Times, an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stands, where he attacks the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's fees is "fully absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson for the Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for intentional murder, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is associated with CBS.
After dismissal with Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Simpson's bailout was set at $350,000, reports the local newspaper The Advocate.
The Coroner of East-Baton Rouge announced an early autopsy report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
Baton Rouge police thanks the Louisiana state police's special forces, the state police's crime lab, the Southern University police, and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The athletic director at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being "awaken in achieving justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 metre high basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 setbacks per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "trustless" after Wayde was killed.
"This is something we are always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash over Mexico City
Oak from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Crisis Prevention asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and the center recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumbles and tremors.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash on cars in different neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police noise along with Catalan separatists within the anniversary of the voice of independence
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence noised along with police forces, and thousands of other protesters protested against independence one year after the vote on possible detachment from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder coats that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Compounds also broke out later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours separatists shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the Protestants against independence shouted, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were being treated for small injuries after the protests.
The vote is still pressed in the region and many will still have independence one year after the 1st October run, which was called illegally by Madrid, but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voiced for independence, but there was also low voter participation among those against independence and boycott the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent the noise and elective collision occurred in the region.
Groups who were too self-sustaining slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
However, the demonstration went off the stack, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests along with his wife, said he no longer has hope of independence in Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying of joy in order to voice for independence, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties are struggling too independently to retain power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while waiting for the trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was hauled up by police officers on both sides.
"The excitement is increasing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been part of ongoing trials since last year, declared that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"To stand up as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.

An armbrush may have been used to shoot at the car.
Menga shots give Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures says
Upset Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experience his second victory after 18 games as coach for Glasgow Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's side evened with Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no away wins in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and is going to play against Hearts, as they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six consecutive victories, and head coach Holt has still not lost since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances of the away team
Holt's team would have hired long before scoring, creating several problems for the Rangers with their direct playing.
Scott Robinson broke through but had low effort towards goal, which allowed Alan Lithgow to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal became scora.
The Rangers agreed to a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson headed towards Menga, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the penalty field.
Within that time, Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flipped far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passports were sent back and forth in the Livingston penalty field, while two penalties - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were waved away.
'Fenomenal' from Livingston analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal battle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played amazingly and still impresses the basket upwards.
Their playing and player style has barely changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks for it goes to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since he became a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, organizing a military-level defence, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the game.
The Rangers, unlike, were not motivated.
Even as good as they have been under Gerrard, however, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and just cut up the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize they don't reach up anymore.
Erdogan is welcomed in Cologne
The government leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29, in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
Countries have been unanimous in terms of human rights, press freedom, and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque due to "security reasons," but many of Erdogan's supporters showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also appeared to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German state's decision to wish him welcome in the country.
The duelling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others, who view it as an autocrats.
Car accident in Deptford, London: Cyclist killed after collision by car
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a car London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in southeast London, at 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and ambulance personnel arrived quickly, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred just a few months after another cyclist died when the driver ran off in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from today's accident.
London police reported that they are identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other motorists have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards have been injured in a revolt in a men's high-security jail, the England prison office says.
Ongoing disorder erupted in the HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces have been acquired to calm down the insurgency, involving eight prisoners in a secluded part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for small injuries in the duck.
A prison spokesman said: "Special trained guards should calm down the ongoing rebellion in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our jails, and we are ready that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in jail anymore."
It sits more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated for injuries, after a prisoner attacked.
And last October, special forces had to come to the prison to calm down a serious riot, where prisoners threw billiard balls on the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with embarrassment (in favor of drought areas)
Tropical low pressures are rare in Arizona, but it is precisely such a weather phenomenon that is heading towards Arizona early next week, in what the remains of Hurricane Rosa pull southwest across the desert and create fear of embarrassment.
The national weather service has expired with warnings against embarrassment on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and may give rain already late Monday.
The Phoenix national weather service twitra that only "ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane reaching 60 kilometres within the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can rain between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the Southwest Desert, including central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with isolated total amounts up to 10 centimeters.
For areas beyond embarrassment risk, the rain from Rosa may be a blessing in the dried.
Although embarrassment is a serious concern, this rain will likely benefit areas in the southwestern United States that are subjected to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, there are extreme droughts in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest drought category, weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa comes to move across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometres per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm encounters colder water in the Pacific Ocean and so calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm force, Monday afternoon or evening.
It is going to rain a lot in parts of Mexico, which can increase the risk of embarrassment.
"Ranges between 7 and 15 centimeters are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimeters," weather.com reported.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull further up through Arizona into south Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger of Rosa or its remains, is much rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the American Southwest Desert," the national hurricane center said.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening embarrassment in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teen boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, England.
The teenage boy was found damaged in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4pm on Saturday.
He was transported to hospital, and his condition is stable.

Police have urged people who may have mobile footage of what happened, to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffering" under how "suffering and angry" the Democrats were against him
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "did" under how "suffering and angry" the Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's charge that he assaulted her sexually decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified of her charges during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, a lawyer with flawless service in the public," he said to a crowd of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the importance of the Republicans to vote in the middle elections in the United States.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't stand, but I really stand," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are looking to "resist and block."
The first important voice in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place last Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, the numbers of killed increases
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a severe earthquake and a tsunami framed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to take part in a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six metres high, struck the beach at sunset, taking many people as they destroyed everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the warning of the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not leave immediately and so they became victims," stated Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the Indonesia GDPB emergency relief agency, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami wasn't enough in itself, he took cars, tree trunks, houses; he framed everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled over open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed into trees to avoid the tsunami and thus survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the emergency agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continue to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes could be marked in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's agency for testing and testing technology (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atomic bomb over Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho quelled the damage as "inclusive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the casualties have been found under the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and the size of the destruction may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication has been cut" said Nugroho.
"More than 300,000 people live there," stated the Red Cross, adding that their added and volunteers are on their way to the hit areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," said the Red Cross.
The emergency agency became criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had thrust Palu, although authorities said waves arrived within the time period notified.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building crying desperately to humans down the streets to warn them against the upcoming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, bringing buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video at first.
The quake and tsunami caused power outages and cut communication around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate the necessity.
The military has started the process of submitting cargo planes with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, reports the authorities, but refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
It was scheduled for President Joko Widodo to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of casualties in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
The added in the World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely to Palu City, and have set up tents in the backyard of their office. On their way to the city passed the total-destructed areas, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
While emergency relief organizations start their efforts to help those who were hit by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign emergency relief workers with emergency management expertise have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their adders cannot start work until Indonesia has declared that the area is a national emergency zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"There is a crisis at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"When the state says, "OK, this is a national crisis," we can open for international emergency aid, but they have not updated the status yet."
There is evening left in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those still missing still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not plar end well.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had doctors caught next to her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Mandagi said that some of the people who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear on," he said.
Gendon told him desperately sending WhatsApp messages to the Palu paragliders, who had participated in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only a grey chin, rather than two blue chin.
"I think that means the messages didn't arrive," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from ATM in Newport, Levee, United States
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a worker in the company Brink's in what he was filling up a Newport, Levee, United States, according to a Newport police press release.
The worker had just emptied an ATM in the entertainment area and was delivering more money, detective Dennis McCarthy stated in the press release.
As the worker was busy, "spring a man up behind the worker" and steal a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects as they escaped from the scene, according to the press release, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If someone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rappar is renamed Ye
Rapparen Kanye West changes its name - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "The creation previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came right before he would appear on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she canceled due to "emotional reasons," the program host said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist names, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye - to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West earlier, has also changed the style of writing to the name with and without hyphen and capital letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised to never send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never will use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shot on peaceful protesters and killed about 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have caused youth to join criminal gangs.
US should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China works more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government stated about artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the budget for research on artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
A doubling in funding may double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence taking place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month via publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the highest ranked player of the game Othello, and later worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google, China.
Lee recognized former technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as the "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked how long the next competition should be, so that he was involved and identify the next visionaries.
Scientists in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China taking the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired excellent students from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen research into artificial intelligence.
"I thought doctoral students in artificial intelligence should receive automatic retention permission," he said.
The China Council published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Association of Natural Sciences funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the U.S. National Sciences Association and other state organizations' way of handing out money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a common center of artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a committee of artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on the bills on national security and artificial intelligence for months.
Macedonians voice in referendum to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voiced on Sunday in a referendum whether they should rename the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decade-old conflict with Greece, which has attempted to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement for their territory, and has used veto to vote against membership for Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change may undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he shouldn't run into the referendum, and a boycott has sowed doubts about how far the referendum is going to reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the referendum estate is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership and agree with the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters for the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership of the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I'm here today to voice for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding according to the law, a sufficient number of members of Parliament have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make her decide.
In order for the renaming to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds termination.
The state election committee reported that nothing unusual had occurred by 13:00 p.m.
Only 16 percent had the vote, unlike 34 percent in the previous 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko rushed in Strumika in the Macedonian referendum for whether to change their name and open to join NATO and the EU on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum in front of Parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that membership of NATO will draw investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I think the majority are going to vote for the change, of which 80 percent of our citizens will become a member of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "verification of our future."
A poll last Monday by Macedonia's Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are going to take part in the referendum - which is below the required number.
Another poll of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to close, at least 50 percent must run, plus one run.
If the referendum does not close, it can harm the policies of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through the Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked the Brighton defense which led to 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look laughing easily, scoring for 65th minutes.
The Argentine tip welcomed a pass on the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He rushed past three Brighton defense players and reached open track.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty field.
He got past a pass on his left and found Sterling.
The English leader spent his first kick in the field giving the ball back to Aguero, who spent his right foot defeating Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot right into the right end of the goal.
"Aguero still struggles with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We were talking that he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave them sky blue the first advantage in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero accepted the ball deep inside the Brighton territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of Leroy Sane's path.
Sane held the ball while hiring Sterling for the goal.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into goal right before sliding out of the orbit.
City is to play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockies in American baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from the "playoff contention" there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has high competitive instincts, hoping to take the "mound" on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to "playoff" for the Rockies, which leads with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won at least 5-2 against Nationals on Friday night, but is looking forward to locking the first division title.
"Although we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play with such relationships?"
It is still unknown who will start in the Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer may be going to "pitche".
Scherzer, who in that case starts for the 34th time, threw a "bullpen session" on Thursday and is scheduled to "pitche" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, coming from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3 "innings" this season.
Trump gathers voters in West Virginia
The president obscurely referred to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the Republicans to vote in the middle elections in the United States.
"Everything we've done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I run around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see that happening right now.
And they are convinced that they will certainly take back power, you see how awful they are, how nasty they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "oppose and block."
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "sweet and bad and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who caused his audience to bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked documents?
Eh, eh, what?
No, eh no, I'm expecting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant to those who say what they think
When the Momentum activists in my local party voiced to censor me, it was not surprising.
I'm the last in a number of Labour MPs to have been told that I'm not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for being unanimous with Jeremy Corbyn.
As for the importance of conducting responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically was unanimous with former leaders about.
In the call for the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it stated, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In my last eight years as Labour MP, Friday's meetings have been just like this.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not so, and the promise of "snillier" policies has been long forgotten, if it was at all followed.
It has become more and more apparent that different views are not tolerated in Labour and that each opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became party leader, as colleagues I pledged to be politically agreeing with suddenly anticipated that I would change my mind and agree on issues I would never agree with - whether it was then about national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak public it doesn't matter what I say, I always get to mouth on social media and people want me to resign while criticizing center policy and saying that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get gender discriminatory and racist chicks aimed at themselves every day, and who are still professional and do not resign.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period, is how normalized it has become to harass police officers.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. For each mistrust proposal and for each change in party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I have received many advice for the past two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I enrolled in Labour, when I was still going to school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry with Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was falling together, so I would have better public services for those who need them the most - whether it was so as a councillor or government minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, nor in the previous election.
Nobody in Nottingham East may have doubted what I stand for and who of the current leaders I do not agree with.
To those who voted for the bill on Friday I can only say that when the country is crashing against a Brexit that will harm private, local agencies and public services, I don't understand why people care about wasting energy on questioning my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But actually, then is not the only message I have directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the election crisis, whether they are Labour voters or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no one can make me resign or change my policy and prevent me from serving you the way I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to top in Scottish rugby
Two late "tries" may alter the result a little bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr fortified to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
They now stand on top of the pallet as the only invincible layer of a total of ten.
It was their supreme defense and ability to take chances that gave their home team and coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be happy.
"We've been tested in recent games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr consumes praise, they were better than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a "try" in the 14th minute, where Frazier Climo tried a "conversion," which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes of Warriors allowed Melrose to gather, and Jason Baggot took an "unconverted try."
Climo received a penalty right before the break, he scored and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which became "converted" by Baggot, reduced the looping mon by five points.
There arose a long break when Ruaridh Knott became seriously injured and laid on the stretcher, and from the reboot fauk Ayr forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, which Climo "converted."
The acting captain for Ayr, Blair MacPherson, received yellow cards, and again Melrose tried an "unconverted Bruce Colvine try," at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson received yellow cards to cope with Climo without the ball from the penalty lineup, MacPherson scored a "try."
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent the "flanker" Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth "try."
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts new career in the restaurant business
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in conjunction with partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming 9th season is going to be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will not comment on the case, but a source from Scottish Sun newspaper has hinted that Kiernan would involve in the "successful restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes the court will open waterway to the Pacific Ocean
sailors patrol naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flag with ocean blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and duty to return to it."
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century. They long to sail in the Pacific again.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades while Bolivia is waiting for the verdict of the International Court to come on October 1, after five years of scope.
"Bolivia has driven, minded, and, of course, expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are going to look at the judgment of the International Court, hoping that the Court of the Hague supports Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - provides Bolivia with an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - struggling to be elected again next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
"Now we'll be returning to the Pacific soon," he promised in late August.
But some analysts don't think the court is going to allow Bolivia to access the sea - and that little would have changed even if they were allowed to access.
The Netherlands-based UN court has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the court's ruling comes just six months after the last negotiations, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
For the past four years, Bolivia has far from promoted its case, they have done the opposite.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales, with his contentious rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's goodwill, thought Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open new relationships with Chile" and a chance to "set a bar at 139 years of insolence and rather benefit both of them," he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win voices.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"Judge is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they will not abolish nuclear weapons if they cannot trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday in the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow up on the lift they gave during the meeting in Singapore between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the United States' foreign minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart his locked nuclear weapons diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will subordinate if the United States continues sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington refuses to agree to any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang depreciating first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
However, many are critical that Pyongyang believes serious in terms of deconstruction and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive head garments are the last fashion on its way to a shopping street near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you don't have to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special headwear in their SS19 collection. The headwear amazed the public during the Paris fashion week.
Highly impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a lavish, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, wide-bream covering the models' heads.
There was also other oversized worship during the fashion show, including a jewel-pryded watermelon, a wizard hat, and even an ananas - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn together and more similar to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this tremendously dramatic fashion, you can just relax.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats come for sale in a shopping street near you.
The oversized hats come immediately after the "La Bomba", the straw hat with the 60 centimeters wide bracket that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult trademark behind the highly impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation onto the catwalk - a straw beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model carrying her.
The beach bag, with the color of burnt orange and fringes topped with a white leather handle, was the most obvious part of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection during the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the fashion stores next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized worship."
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent exam results, which is only enhanced by individual and joint success in sports, arts, music, and other community measures.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), work to offer the best services to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for secondary and higher education, career pathways, and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can not only sit in English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest stand grades for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students taking foreign language received A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, shows that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those taking German, 69 percent of those taking French, and 63 percent of those taking Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support alien language as vital properties, which children and young people are certainly going to need in the future.
Languages such as electives are regarded as equivalent to the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering studies, and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British selection for addition and properties in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers struggled to fill positions due to lack of language skills in applicants.
Therefore, more and more important is language in school to prepare the youth for the workplace.
With several job opportunities for linguistics, these properties are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a proper advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantage in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75 percent could speak no other language than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Knowing multiple languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to what language they are teaching.
Many schools focus on the classic modern languages, while others teach languages classified as important in the United Kingdom as we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of language to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and give the properties they need to close, no matter what future breasts.
You cannot reject that in this global, business-oriented environment, languages are vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called "international communication properties."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, and so offer diversity and high skills for Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting time is soon ahead of fans looking to see LeBron James debut at the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season match on Sunday, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long to play, has not been decided yet.
"It's going to be more than one minute and less than 49," Walton announced on Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James will most likely play for a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the pre-season.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get me ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins on a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled stops in the coming week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on hold to choose to fill the Supreme Court's vacant position, Trump aims to build support for upcoming mid-way elections since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting is to be given in November.
When time should Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 a.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week's hearings of Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense over charges of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmation vote from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this cave of collections is to help the Republicans meet the November elections and get some momentum (drive power).
So President Trump's campaign says that these five collections next week are aimed at "inciting volunteers and supporters that the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season," an advocate for the Trump campaign refusing to be enlightened to Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection for the evening can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows stomach for game to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be like this Ryder Cup need.
The swinging pendulum of moments is a completely invented sporting attack, but one that players really believe in, and never more than on competitions like these.
So where would they say that moments are now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now there are four, so we take it as a small moment , I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points lead by twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have some wind in their seals, and they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and hires after examples.
The boyural screams of the celebration were higher when his round continued, searched an important putt to take match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt winning them the game at 15, was met with a similar scream, the type that tells you that he believes the American team is not out of this.
"You've actually just had to dig deep and worry about your own battle," Spieh said.
That's all that each of these players has left now.
18 holes to create a brand.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but cute couples are four from four and can't make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to not shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine (the last nine holes on a track with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, cementing that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Talking about European honor will be even too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, the rough Spanish and the Swedish into a hole they never came close by climbing out of.
But on Sunday, nobody can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursome are so fascinating to look at close hold because of the interaction between opponents, advice they give, and advice they don't give and the way that a strategy can change at a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lead into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach of the game that someone, especially the Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup Final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out from Saturday's four balls and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari rented the charge with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to take their game so far on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side charged with retaining the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominating a flawed American side tomorrow fourballs, taking the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in foursomes and won two games, but they could not bring in the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after an insightful weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they then made it great to defeat an outlawed Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more sought after 5 and 4.
Woods, struggling through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for tomorrow's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe didn't even get everything they wanted on a cosy, blown day southwest of Paris.
Three times major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference to the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Just twice in Ryder Cup history, a team has come back from a four-point base and entered singles, although as holders Furyk's side only needs to draw to retain the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, however, it seems like a Sunday counterattack will be outside of them.
North Korea says it's not coming on talk to rust down unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations Saturday that if sanctions continue to increase the distrust of the United States, and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Government that North Korea had taken "significant measures" to improve the conditions of the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and do not promise to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We still don't get anything corresponding back from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase" approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his dismissal proved significant in that he did not reject unilateral nuclear decomposition, such as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement printed by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for "downbuilding nuclear power on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean War from 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to facilitate tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on "destruction of nuclear power first" and increases pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose of coercion, and they even oppose the "declaration to make peace," Ri said.
"The belief that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the sanctions continue, our distrust is only greater."
Ri did not mention anything about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. President highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months and added: "If the party in this encouragement to the demolition of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the demolition on the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Nonetheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatic different from last year, when he told the General Assembly of the F.N. that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the U.S. mainland, after evil president Trump called Kim a rocketman on suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, ausa praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmed, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea deviates its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeframe for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures made.
But the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told F.N.'s Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council still have to be maintained heavily and without failing until we get the complete, final, verified decommissioning of the nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to plunge means to Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the General Assembly of F.N. and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemns him to make "gangster-like claims."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States made "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalizing the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take courses in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University has this year contributed to the fact that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture that involves studying in caffeine throughout the night. That means using caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
An academic found that top university students often careless in terms of the very most basic - how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the influence of sleep shortage on learning.
"At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I told this now, at adulthood?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping - something that surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains students what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said the university decided to introduce the course after students suffered severely worse sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches, and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, as well as the importance of evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, Prof. Czeisler added.
The pride culture over the day still exists, he said and added that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep shortage is a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even avoiding going up to weight, since sleep deficiency puts the brain in starvation mode and makes them constantly starved.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having been a student with him last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push on to get a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar program of study before starting at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, and which can convert the inner clock overall, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goals give Gerrards men downturn
The Rangers went on a new defeat on the away field when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's unprecedented side to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take its first victory off the field since the 4-1 triumph on St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a leader, giving eight points, a round under Ladbrokes' leader of the Premier League , Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time, and a Ranger lineup with lack of inspiration never seemed to equalize.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in stock for the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head, after an item was apparently thrown from the far side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team sweeping Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt , however, went with Livy 11 who scored a point with a drum shot last week, and he would have been thrilled by the way his well-drilled outfit took the queer roof of his opponents on each shift.
Rangers may have had the ball the most , but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after only two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his giant chance.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the retirement.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morellos knew he was to have a penalty on the 20 metre mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's wish.
Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly worried by Lassana Coulibaly's heads and a tam shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the playing rules, no one can deny that they fortified it only because of the "shoot".
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson's ball, which stayed cool to pick Menga out for a simple finish.
Gerrard, in the pause, pretended to trade Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the byte caused an immediate impact when the wing player made a hat for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly raged forward to block.
But Livingstone continues to overlist the guest team to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending out long shots on long shots.
Holt's team could have increased his lead at the end, but McGregor succeeded well in preventing Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow left a long post from the corner mark.
Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim for penalties as he supported with Jacobs, but again oversaw Thomson it.
Almanac: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and VI REKNAR ... the day that he who would become the physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific carrier beam ever since then, the Geiger counter also became a carrier beam in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the seemingly untrue lazy cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in all the world is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms caused by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, now bubbles it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention asking his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of treatment
The method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancers, and then reinstate
A sample vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with vaccines, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced ovarian cancer flooding for more than 18 months.
The method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, allowing them to "see" a protein common in many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drive the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "learning" them how they target cancer cells, has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West commissioned a Pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA hat, after he guested the Saturday Night Live TV show. .
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was ejected in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible performance in which he praised the United States president, Donald Trump, saying he would run for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great caps, he gave the Democrats a tirade and repeated his support to Trump.
"So many times I speak to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a number along with comedian Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's election on the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not sent, West's tirade recordings were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock tried to mock West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he had the difficult backstage due to his head garment.
"They bullied me behind the scene.
They said: Don't go out there with that hat on.
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a submerged place," he said, according to Washington Examinor.
West continued: "Will you see the immersed place?" says that he would "take on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments led to expulsion at least twice from the public, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassingly affected, Variety reported, with a person telling the publication: "The whole studio was deadly."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her former girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the Conservative group TPUUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most brave spirits: THANK YOU STOP TO THE POBEL."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "maybe simply was just as he is and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I did NOT choose to pay anyone (by purchasing his music or clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe embraces and scouts ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are too," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the latest music legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's elective medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often cause young boys to feel they need to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows "maybe strong" to address the problem.
"Personally, I'm informed that something has gone wrong with masculinity." he said.
"What have we learned men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He continues: 'What is congenital and what is taught?
What is learned on TV and in the streets, what makes young boys feel they need to be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones precursor or sequel when the series ends in summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he is watching the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the named Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are framed in the country, health benefits say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transferred through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally HIV quickly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the amount of people who received HIV in this way was reduced to nearly zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ people is claimed to be widespread floral.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have counted that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transfers of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies adding lacquer information from GOP senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
United States Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were pedalized by "extreme-right wing" surveys and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information included enlightened home addresses and phone numbers of American Sens. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill under a Senate panel's hearing of the charges of sexual assault on Supreme Court voter Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released the information of a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continues.
"One of my added ones - who have been given their identity, personal information, and security compromised as a result of these unreasonable and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's question quickly received online criticism, including from former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They must not question the motives of the blamer.
They must be quiet and peaceful."
Fleischer proved to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seemingly angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to take over Waters place in the midterm election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he tweeted.
In her dismissal, Waters said her office had warned "the right governments and the law enforcement units of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continues, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to each of my co-workers."
Johnny English hits again - spy toll by weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit remarks in all new films with a British angle, and it works current for this revival of Johnny England's action comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and which was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satire that deals with how openly unclear we are, become the new export potential in the country?
In any case, the big-eyed, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber duck has, for the second time, been renewed his permission to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic maker for cinema scientists in non-English-language countries.
He is of course the foolish, secret agent who despite his bizarre wishes to spread some glamour has received a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of that guy contributing a simple tune to the Firecars, the theme at the 2012 London Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also originally based on the travelling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in the aftermath.
There are one or two fine moments in this last JE excursion.
I loved Johnny English who approached a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armorsuit while the rotor leaves hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on the screen, but humor feels quite weak and remarkably redundant, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like he is directed at children instead of adults, and for me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replica closure in the person in Bean.
The permanent current assumption now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spys, which reveals the identities of all agents Britain has in the field, to the dismay of the agent at work - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and war-torn figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political impopulation: Emma Thompson does his very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is not so much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every active spy has been accused, she must bring in someone who is retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a somewhat elegant establishment , but provides unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academy for spying.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a emergency briefing and reunited with his former comprehensive assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved over to a submarine driver's job, an overenthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Services is back to the fullest in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the charismatic technology billionaire's enchantment, which claims that he can solve Britain's computer problem: the scary Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of paternity-like game: disguised as waiters, they set fire at a nice French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves aboard Volta's boat; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are surely pulled out to the last sequence, but as loving and undisciplined as it is, there is quite a lot of children's TV all over.
Pretty moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice his talents?
Labour Labour party refuses that they are working out a plan for the English to work for a four-day week, but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party now considers a radical plan that wants the British to work for a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
The party will, according to the report, that corporate executives are sending further savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, by giving them an extra free day.
Then added would be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still receive the same salary.
Sources said the idea would "pass" with the economic agenda of the party and plans to increase advantages for employees.
The change of a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for employees to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected announced before the end of the year.
"It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a wish that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as superior to the party's industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its 2017 campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently approved by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not party politics and it is not being considered by the party."
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell spent last week's work conference to enhance his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless executives" and "profitors" in wealthy businesses.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in the water companies cannot regain their entire effort as a Labour government could do "reductions" due to perceived misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate governance and created Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to provide 10 percent of equity in private sector ventures added, which would receive annual dividends of up to £500, approximately $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the TV program "60 Minutes" if the FBI s in Kavanaugh's investigation could make them change their thoughts
The FBI investigation on complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of the extent found to the agency could affect some Republican senators to draw their support.
In an interview sent Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked in "60 Minutes" Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on my way into the hearing, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, firmly determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice seems to be seen in stone.
"I've made up my opinion of Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett severely denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all she named could not confirm it.
It's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a tremendously impressive lineup of stars acting and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocked to Central Park's great lawn, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to increase awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert scientists had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary work; send e-mails to a world leader, call a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help increase awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how great success has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to reach his goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feel like they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, and participated in and pushed on a variety of goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their actions, hence at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to "helping children reach their full potential"; vowing to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," — told the ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to require Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on their website, they ask, "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "There will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will be successful, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors performing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Fleet as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports interior secretary
Washington may "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate on the invitation of the legitimate government - is an incentive to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to convey energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has this ability, with our Fleet, to make sure the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure their energy is not going to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants on the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group presenting itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution to Iran and Russia is more or less to utilize and replace fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy depending on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been commissioned to increase the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, officials in Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump, try to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipe project, which according to Trump made Berlin the "capture of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's eager opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the position that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has drawn a backlash from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would take a "ground look" on running as presidential candidate after the mid-term election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider thoroughly running for president."
Warren entered President Donald Trump at the Town Hall meeting and said he "brings this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has been harsh in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court election Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should run for a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run for candidate, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe investigation.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
The investigation showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidate, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with a violence incident in his home on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he returns, allows me to relate to other families characterized by PTSD and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," she said to the public at a collection for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and airmen and all other military, have done for the country, exists".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of physical violence in his home against a woman, for disrupting a report of violence in his home and the preservation of a weapon while he was rushed, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang elected or elected at home.
Representatives from the 18 states and district submitted a friend-of-right short Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions fits that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberty Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the elective gang-member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States supporting Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large amount of applicants for American asylum, whose nations face pervasive problems with gangs and violence in the home.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from immigration law, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing violence in their homes, to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum cases to be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle to this principle," the friend-of-right said briefly.
Lawyers further claimed in the summary that the policy that denies immigrants' access harms the US economy, saying it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "offers necessary work".
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing abuse and gang elected in June.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions on June 11 in his announcement of politics.
Asyl was never meant to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day worldwide.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while the death toll doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who thrusted his feverish baby son at an evacuation center in the destroyed city, Palu.
"Every minute ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is difficult to find."
Residents have been observed returning to their destroyed homes, in what they search through water damaged possessions and attempted to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.5, were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes while telling him that he knew the powerful earthquake shaken the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think, " Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador blames China for "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page advertisement in an American daily and highlighted the mutual advantages of trading with the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador blamed China Beijing for using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid bill in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's largest sales newspaper - after accused China of trying to mix in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's charge that Beijing was trying to mix in U.S. elections, marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has seen them in innings increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to match exporters in states like Iowa supporting Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," Branstad wrote in a statement in Sunday's Des Moines register, "dobbing now the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of America's beloved tradition of freedom of speech and a free press by posting a paid ad in the Des Moines register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper ceremony down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited divergent votes and will not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic orbit, given that the media are under the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party "screw him.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dismiss the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans evade female voters ahead of the middle term with Kavanaugh Debacle, warns Analytics.
As many top Republicans are stand-by and defend Supreme Court election Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several charges of sexual abuse, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-way elections.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on have recorded that they already wanted to move on with a vote.
These things cannot be undone, Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, says to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) last moment's pressure for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, the DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November Coming!" while demonstrating in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who run the court committee, chose to move on with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be outside the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it has already been high, that's true.
But it can get higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony as detailing the allegations of sexual assault directed against the supreme Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggested a setback could follow if the Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has been a confused mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is seen on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that contributes to electing Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little split over who to believe in in the wake of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more siding with the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and also at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the judiciary committee of the Senate under ownership last week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals while attending a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, memo lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in a web browser and all at once.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal authority through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process, and appropriate abilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some added developers contracting to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google not to introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new online collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of great influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era on the web," added Berners-Lee ten l.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross divine celebration
The only Divine of the English Church that won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in its home city 100 years afterwards.
Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic", that the stone would be unveiled just 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann hired his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 "through a very thick shoveled and under heavy fire from fields and machine guns."
He later ran up to the front line, and with the "largest galantery" led the line forward before he alone rushed forward with a field gun and knocked out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am audacious of."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very the era of playing a role in the parade, adding that "the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people."
The MMA fans were up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a packed Bellator 206 but then you won't see the main event.
The San Jose reckoning contained 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 in the morning, just in what Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare to meet, viewers in the United Kingdom were again stunned when coverage changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had remained awake to the early hours especially for the match.
A fan on Twitter challenging switch to the children's comics as "a kind of sick joke."
"It is public regulation that at 6 o'clock if the hole was not owned like this, then they had to switch to the program of the children," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked for the transfer.
"The Peppa Pig, "Yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they are going to work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of replay, I think we can probably figure it out," Coker said.
"But the time is six in the morning of a Sunday, and we can't figure out this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, as it passed over, there were many lyrics that went back and forth, and all were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We hold it for five games instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to hand over to the fans, and we just walked over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "underlegent" due to sexuality
Olympic diving Tom Daley says that in his upbringing he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said that he did not realize until he attended a secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke at the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay's rights to give others "hope".
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in the cross-country shows, Kirsty Young, has taken off several months due to illness.
What could look like a lost in Laverne's first program, Daly said that he knew himself "less than" anyone else who grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different has been the real things that have given me power and strength to succeed."
He would prove that he was "something," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he knew lucky that could live open without branches and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympic age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and downturns.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his entire "his" perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, then everything was about I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Mi Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death and one of the last things he had asked about was if they had tickets to London 2012 - when he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't say to him you're not going to be on the front row," he said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a home audience on an Olympic game, where fans no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Stolt of Heather Small - which had vibrated with him in the build-up of the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs are on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape Mickelson sits on the bench at Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must reverse his form to avoid it being an accidental milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was seen on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk within Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game within the reach of the hope of correcting what bothers him.
Never the most competent langskota. Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting alongkota on the tropice, French main court, where balls hit outside if the golfer is not exactly with the hits.
And if the track itself is not frightening enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth game on Sunday, the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single games, get to a hot start, Mickelson's game can be completely determined.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a clap on his back and put my arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he played two games.
I imagined more, but that was how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will defeat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches being played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses, and seven halves, although Furyk said his proximity added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's fun, he's sarcastic, entertaining, enjoys keeping fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the teamroom," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun that got a round with him as well, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes a lot more than just playing."
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big lease can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead en route into the last days' singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant trip.
The Danish made their debut in the 1997 match on Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, wins 141-131-2.
"You continue to remind you that we had a great lead on Valderrama; we had a great lead on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only so far," said Bjørn, after he had seen the Class 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to hire 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You go to full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have the score on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've said all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're so well aware of what's over on the other side - the biggest actors in the world."
Glad for how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjørn added: "I would never take the lead.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow it's the individual achievements that emerge, and there's another thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there individually, you’ll be tested fully out of your capacity as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself as well."
Contrary to Bjørn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be on the lookout for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the turnover operations on the big last days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he quit losing as Europe pulled off the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players en route into the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When that moment gets to go a way, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-midfield matches.
We set up our line-up correspondingly and set the boys going in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow" .
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to hire the game and face Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn about his choices of singles.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The latest fregat of the German Navy should have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year due to the wrong system and tremendous costs, local media reported.
Launching Rhineland-Pfalz, the leadership of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships the Navy ordered back in 2007, comes as a replacement for the aging Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful gun, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from the harbours at home level.
Yet continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships, which allegedly allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be outdated when entering service, notes Die Zeit.
The accidental F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
It was little known about the causes of the return, but German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship useless if they were deployed on a combat task.
Software errors were especially important as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be run by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the labor of older Bremen frigates.
It was also found that the ship is dramatically overweight, reducing performance and restricting the ability the fleet has to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as similar ships that became used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including training of the crew - becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from initial €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems related to the latest frigates, become especially important in light of the latest warnings that Germany's fleet force decreases.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence election of the German Parliament, recognized that the fleet in fact "has almost an end to distribution-competent ships".
The officer said the problem has been built on over time, because old ships were dismissed, but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He apologised that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust steals secret life of bats
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow regular and soprano pipestrelles and also brown long ears and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS added and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat conversations and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural science advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will uncover which areas of habitats, natural homes, which are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the acquisition of meadows and how it is best to maintain equal forest areas for bats and other associated species.
Flagermus populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects rest places and the loss of habitats/residences.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as flying paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks of pet cats.
Flag mice are not actually blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo localization technique to find errors and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76.000 hectares of land around the country, take the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly perform investigations, rest space inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there is much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within property, as it is possible that infinite destruction of a single site can kill up to 400 women's bats and young people, and perhaps outrade an entire local population.
Flag mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, plague or disrupt them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are dangerous."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges in what lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape charges against him as "false news", saying that people "want to highlight" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus the forward have been accused of electing an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers just hours after the charges, that the charges are "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They will be known to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good, "Let the player add and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unfair reporting of suspicions within the area of privacy", according to Reuters
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral injury in an amount accounting for the severity of the violation , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, claiming to have elected her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the supposed incident and told him he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed with "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken by her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed on an equalization because she felt "scrambled by retaliation" and was concerned "to become publicly audacious."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to change her residence as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever undo' to lose car manufacturers
Britain "would undo it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in automobile production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "about" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the effect of border delays in case a non-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston facility - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My conception is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director of Burnaston.
Other British automakers have raised fears of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns deal with what car manufacturers say are the risk of supply chains in case of a non-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, disruptions at the border that the industry says may result in delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day values of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checkers plan for future relationships with the EU is "nettop calibrated to avoid the checks at the border."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deals that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this possibility, "he told BBC Radio 4's day program.
"The evidence from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we must certainly be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production was to be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the facility and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the facility, said that his members are more concerned with: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with deputy attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back for a week" as the fight against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Council Robert Mueller, investigating Russian choice mix, connections between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstacles to justice by the President.
Correctly Trump will say up the general of the attorneys or not, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has fed Washington gossip for several months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lease to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th change.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was saying up.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then with the UN in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was projected to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have charged him with sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were quoted.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying full vote from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There has been no date set. It may be this week, but I can and imagine it will be delayed another week due to everything else happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters will probably say unanimous in it: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientations was not due to a dissatisfaction with TV reporters' game for the gallery, although she said, "I'm not unanimous in that they do."
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
"The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before," she said - rightly without making evidence of the claim. "We've looked at the numbers."
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "If the pressure gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it that way, and you've seen us do it often in recent weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president might demonstrate why, where he performed leading the reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit fear to workers from the EU at the NHS in Scotland
The health secretary has written to workers from the EU who work at the NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter although there is less than six months left before the United Kingdom resigns from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to take on the costs of applications that have the status determined for EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations have ongoing withdrawal between the United Kingdom and the EU continues, and it approaches the expected ending in autumn.
Yet the British government has stepped up preparations in case there will be no deal.
I realize this must be a difficult time for you all.
Therefore, I will now repeat the great price I viewed on the contributions of all added, no matter what nationality they have.
Collaborators from the EU, and outside, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve work in the health sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly diver home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at the Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency operation after pulling on an injury in the head when the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports the newspaper The Tennessean.
Head coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before a break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official Tennessee State spokesman, WSMV told Abercrombie to have finished operating at Vanderbilt medical centers.
There are no details about the extent of the damage yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie attends the second year of the university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before he was injured in Saturday's game, and is now up in 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The additional income should be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success by attracting young voters
The increase in document fees will be added to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The state box expects an increase of up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The additional income should be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who earn a lot, vowing to offer reasonable housing.
The increase in document fees will be added to individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of strikes.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago in the second residence and rental housing, may be at as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the decision to bring in up to £120 million a year.
Approximately 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside the UK. This makes prices higher, and it becomes harder for first-time buyers to enter the residential market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become " ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers that most of the time reside in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He charged large construction firms to keep prices up by obtaining property but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas in reasonable housing to fix Britain's "built cabin".
Corbyn has announced a series of conspicuous proposals for residential reforms, including controlled rent and the conclusion of expulsions for no reason.
He will and give advice greater power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my position to bring back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
That means fixing the broken residential market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
Yet it may not be right that it should be as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or foreign firms, to buy housing as it is for hard-working, British residents.
For many people, the dream of own housing has fallen too far away, and the audacity of being re-strikey is real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scots (42) glance over the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. Currently they are in third place in League One, just three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish Elite Series last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B national team match, and that was it," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hamden along with my father, and there's always been something that's pulled me back.
That possibility can only come if I have success as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager, include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come after so many established names in such a large club, since he has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, success for me will be measured in if I 'can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably just look at myself as successful if I manage to get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a term as assistant head of Dumbarton and a 15-month period in Hearts' coaching apparatus.
He then helped Alloa to get from downrykking to third level, transforming St Mirren, who was about to advance down, into the title winner of the championship series the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"It was another road gap," he says of leading Alloa.
"I really thought that being a manager suited me much better than being a player.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well, lit well, and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you're forced to get through every week.
I still notice it when it comes to the stress and pressure on the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm it. It's the most comfortable I've felt in my own body throughout my adult life."
Sunday, September 30, you can hear the entire interview at Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
Investigation shows that the perfect time for a half-liter is at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday
The summer's hot wave has led to an increase in the influx of struggling pubs in the United Kingdom, but and increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales increased by 2.7 percent in child labour - but for the restaurant industry, it declined by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Business advisor Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "Attaining the sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern for June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, just that restaurants became even harder framed.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry only worsened in July.
Pubar and bars selling drinks made it markedly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubar selling food, got and noticed the decline in the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had dropped three percent.
Paul Newman, analytic for travel and leisure at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to sale in the nightlife industry.
It is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still struggle. A decrease in sales of 4.8 percent annually will be painful to get on top of a laping cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for operators doing food. The time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a long-awaited breathing space."

One in five children has secret social media profiles that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media profiles that they hide from parents and teachers, shows a survey
Examination of 20,000 students on progress reveals an increase in "false Insta" profiles
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head" profile they show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - creates profiles on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey among 20,000 students on a secondary school revealed a powerful increase in "false Insta" profiles - a reference to the Instagram image sharing platform.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a sterile "head" profile they refer to parents, while also having private profiles.
A mother who flipped over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who urged others to "choose me".
The research, done by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in various schools, found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are being attempted to create places online where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletic board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-administering director at the Board's annual General Assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland, and Chairman Ian Beattie describes the incident as a great possibility for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom, and the world's athletic communities, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland can benefit from getting it into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can help and help the sport in Scotland."
The American, having gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among its total four Olympic golds and now a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go for a drip.
On Twitter, he wrote: "Today it is a month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it was only the time to tell me if I was going to be good again, or to what extent.
There's been exhausting work, but I've gotten quite good again, learned to go again, and today I'm doing flexibility boots!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Divided opinions on the Internet about breast pump ads comparing mothers with milk runs
A breast pump company has split public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers with milk carriage.
To mark what is described as "the world's first silent, seat-on breast pump," technology company Elvie released a small-freck advertising inspired by music videos to demonstrate freedom the new pump gives mothers who recover milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes text such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you don't mark it, this is not tenses, it's my tits."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these children, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
On the other hand, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it highlights "the horror" in the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, just that the calves are trusted from them just days after birth," one writes.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their kids?"
Another added: "For abusive advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she thinks the song is "party."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I still breastfeed.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This advertisement is a bit crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers pumping (often at work or at the toilet) and feeling like cows.
This is not an advertisement boasting or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the discreet pump wrapped into their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely quiet, has no joints or tubes, and its discreet inside an breast-BH, giving women the freedom to move, keep their kids, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: "Elvie pump is such a very revolutionary product, that it consumes a votal and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers that extract milk and milk carriage, we wanted to put spotlights on breast pumping and challenges associated with this, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved in silence to tent camp on Texas border
The number of imprisoned immigrant children has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the strict policy the Trump administration has introduced makes it harder to place the children at sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been unproven immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and receiving a child may threaten their own possibility of being in the country.
The risk for it increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members will be required to submit fingerprints, and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence quoted the Immigration and Customs Enforcement for Congress and said the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsor of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had nothing on their record already.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegal, and a large part of these are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to continue pursuing these people," Albence said.
According to employees in the camp, new rules have now been introduced to handle the children. The rules require some of them now to be in court before a month has passed, against previous 60 days.
Many people will participate via video calls and not at personal attendance, to have their case tried leading an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to elective outbreaks or escape deadlines, they say added to the camp. Reports that have appeared in the last few months say the same.
Proponents say these concerns are greater at large plants like Tornillo. Because of the size of the plant, it is more likely that you overlook signs of child wear.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or say hated to friends, can enhance the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria asks U.S., French, and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw instantly
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, though the country is now at war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who and serve as Deputy Prime Minister, said that emerging forces reside illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of defeating terrorism, and "will be treated from it".
"They have to retreat instantly and without prerequisites," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight a holy battle until all Syrian territories have been cleansed" for both terrorist groups and "illegal presence of emerging."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counseling both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
When talking about the refugee problems, Moualem said that it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed "some Western countries" for having "spread irrational fear" about the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return," he said.
"They make politics out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help getting to rebuilding in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
Diplomats from the United Nations say that a recently formed agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major rebel fortress, has created a possibility to continue pushing forward with political conversations.
The Russian-Turkish deal defenses a large attack by Russian-backed, Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem underlined that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including Nusrafront warriors, who are associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
The UN issued, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way for the election.
Moualem lays down conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution," and warned against disruptions.
Why Trump is going to win another term
With that logic, Trump will win the 2020 re-election if not, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the presidency will have an early end due to scandals and impeachment.
It would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic ending of a presidency ever!"
At the moment of writing, there are no signs that viewers have got bored.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in best broadcast time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly tripled its to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has doctors at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are lured by, because that's something we don't understand," Neal Baer said in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," dealing with a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a trip in Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied according to Scovell.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the story coming from Washington may determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families may be back together and heal the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources of "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich to $15,000 ("a garment thick of arrogance," said Washington Post) and the implications of the Great Threat'shers to $15,"
Personally, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Parts of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily leader at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the show that takes place with Trump's employees and daily disputes (go into a game with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you don't hang with anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to twist away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanged in a thin thread.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows before in the time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside streams into the densest intermediate campaign
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a conversion of the districts of Congress which led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
It recently converted the suburban district of Pittsburg promotes Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in spring last year.
Lamb fights another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative in the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, who largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were re-signed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January determined that the old districts were illegally formed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th district has launched a truce on funding the campaigns, between the major parties' money arsenal, the Democratic Congressional election, and the Republican Congressional election.
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a button mark in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had belonged to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a scarce advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador due to support for China, but resigned
Diplomats remarked that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the Trump organization's leadership group.
The secretaries of state decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Ministry spokeswoman, in a statement early this month.
However, penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development, and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which contained cuts to financial support and targeted restrictions in terms of visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment rates and murder rates.
As internal meetings evolved, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore put a stop for the assessment of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will face the conference, which has been scheduled in mid-October, as a signal on the relevance the administration puts on the collection, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the presumption of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the administration and and spoke under the prerequisite of anonymity.
Study History
A wait for Special Advisor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller reportedly turned focus in the investigation against whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia ideira attacks on our election.
If Congress was to exchange boards, Trump will have to stand up to this body, in what he prepares to convince voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot of "what about", and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable - either for his counterpart in Europe.
There are choices to take for us all on both sides of the pond, which will affect how extended the fight can become.
In 1938 German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, only the West had stood against him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a possibility to avoid the years of bloodbath this brought.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or deferred.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water ever since this paper revealed that last year he proposed to intercept the president in hiding, and speculated he is unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the recently asked FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair--or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual abuse, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we in the middle election vote for a congress that holds Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're failing, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrating to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to light Sabbath lights on the table asking the Swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic in terms of the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that say over the Australians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2-2 result against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to larger things.
"It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could have taken it at the end, but overall, a tie is probably a fair result.
They were likely better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better team.
On Thursday, there will be yet another major European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it'll be a tough game. They got a good result in their previous game, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
In the past year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the boys thrive; exercise is good.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women Lose Sleep Over This Fear of Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts on how they would be cared for, few people were talking to family members about it.
Approximately half of those who participated in a survey from the insurance company Nationwide, they said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they were talking to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says vice president of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your kids: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't make your wishes known good time in advance.
Collaborate with an advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a big part of determining the costs.
Pick up an economic advisor: Your advisor may also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
The long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a cash-value life insurance to help pay the expenses, or that you assimilate yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal battles before they start.
Get a health authority in place, so that you designate a person you trust to supervise your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in line with your wishes in cases you cannot communicate.
You can also consider an authority for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you do not have the possibility yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your old parent has a medical emergency and is on its way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan, so you are ready.
"It's not just the finances it's about, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medication is that?
Who should take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready."
Man shot several times with air gun in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air gun in what he was heading home after a trip to the city.
The victim in his 40s was in the area around Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers describe the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. local time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police ask for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, say public officials. The number of dead is expected to increase.
Without the possibility of communicating, aid workers have not received any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu which is closer to the epicenter of the quake that had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the Sulawesi Island.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is an area that extends over more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, in 2017 had an estimated population of 299 200.
Fishing and farming is the beekeeper in the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is and important in the province, but is mostly concentrated to Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been thrust by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses were destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of Donggala was thrust by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Age of the Pacific Ocean and is regularly framed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major tremors and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large quake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 266,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of these in Aceh.
2005: A number of large quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake hit south Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami crashing into the south coast and killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 quake hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake hit one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of approximately 10 metres which destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A small quake hit the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the 2004 quake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings raging.
2018: Large quake hits the tourist island of Lombok and kills more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested and charged with violence in the home
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, charged with assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska state police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of violence in the home, interference in reporting violence in the home and opposing arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she attempted to call the police to report the offences.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su prison, and is held against bail $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court Saturday and pleaded "not guilty" when asked, citing the network.
Palin faces three class A misconducts, which means he can be imprisoned for up to one year and get $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a class B misconduct, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin has been charged with anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in the Alaska veteran court.
In January 2016, he was charged with attacks in his home, involvement in a reporting of violence in his home and holding a weapon while intoxicated in the context of the incident.
His girlfriend had alleged that he struck her in the duck.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after connecting his son's elective behavior to PTSD which dates from when he served in Iraq.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds lost their lives
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake, with a magnitude of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed several thousand homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and the numbers of the casualties are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit right outside the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment where the quake hits, flourishes on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the bank.
Federal prosecutors will have rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror
Federal prosecutors in New York will have the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal offence in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "in deliberately" and that he "inflicted" on them serious, bodily harm, according to a note filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these events may lie the basis for a possible death penalty, it says in the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 charges, including eight charges of murder with targets of money-extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in the context of organized crime, and a charge for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "essential planning and overlay", said the prosecutors and intimidated the way Saipov carried out the attack as "abominable, cruel, and corrupted".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the note reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since last the Southern District of New York has sentenced the death penalty in a case.
That term, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was conducted in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was well, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, it is said in charge.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty at all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "clearly disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accept a statement of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of the incident for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Tory Member of Parliament believes Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize people's army" today, during a protest at the Tory convention.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that politicians had to "feel the pressure" of the Euroscepticians — as one of Theresa May's MEPs suggested that he should hire the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, meining Member of Parliament Peter Bone told the Birmingham protesters that Britain "had been out" now, if Farage was Brexit minister.
With the challenge May faces in reconciling his deeply split ranges has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who want to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep the plan with the Chequers compromise on track after attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers as well as the EU.
Allies insist that she will push on to put in place a deal with Brussels, despite the backstep - and forced the Euroscepticians and the Labor Party to choose between her package and "caos".
Bone told Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihull that he wished to "reproach Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should have been given a decent rank and received responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had overthrown, we would be out now," he said.
The Member of Parliament from Wellingborough, added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own laws in our own country".
Bone declines the claim that the opinion of the people has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed meaning and want to become is completely false".
Brexit fighters from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march. She told the reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and make us choose initially.
Please, drop Chequers and listen."
In a message directed at May, she adds: "State ministers keep their jobs when they keep what they promise".
Farage said police officers must be "knowing the heat" if they were going to betray the decisions made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that "we're not going to let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to get the political class, which is on the tip to betray Brexit, to feel the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us say in Brexit and should not rest until we have become an independent, self-directed, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, the Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the center.
A handful of activists whipped with "Tories Against Brexit" banner after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"This is the people who tell us they can have all computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a frictionless limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farse.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take a "happy look" on running for the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take "a careful look at running for the presidential election" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke of his future during a city meeting in the west of Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but as a board member of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the center of too much speculation that she might want to try against Trump in 2020.
The incident in Holyoke on Saturday, was her 36th meeting with voters in a City Hall since Trump joined.
A participant asked if she had plans to run for presidential elections.
Warren replied that it is time for women to take the trip to Washington to fix our broken government, and it includes a woman on top."
Arrests made in the shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the case where basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), Wayde Sims, was shot and killed Friday.
At 11:00 a.m. local time, police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen on the video clip.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team orders would have a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start on the race, allowing Hamilton to take care of himself in defending his position for the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and allowed Hamilton to enter the traffic at the back of the course, which should be determined.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ported in front of a bit of action side-by-side which left the Ferrari driver unwillingly allowed the inside to be free in danger of being unable to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st anniversary, on the rear row and was in seventh at the end of the first round.
After that, he led much of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of driving past Kimi Raikkonen who was fourth.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his speed in the last eight laps while the Raikkon won fourth.
It's a difficult day, for Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday due to her insistence that she did not lay the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she charges Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had directly given to the Senate Commission, but rather commented that what takes place in the Senate showed that people were "difficult and awful and spoke false".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and unpleasant and talk false," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you think?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leave it?
Do you remember her answer... did you lay the document - "oh, eh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leave it."
Wait a moment.
Lak we... No, we didn't," he added, while emulating the Senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it became play earlier in September - but Feinstein refused the leak coming from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leave her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked about."
But her refusal did not fall in good soil with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I say to you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with poor sexual behavior by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own gain.
"They are determined to take back power in every way they see necessary.
You see the slembity, the horror, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee stars compensated for the loss against the Belfast Giants on Friday winning the return match 5-3 on Saturday.
Giants received an early two-target lead due to attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized before Dwyer once again sent the Giants in the lead.
Francois Bouchard equaled for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the league this season for Adam Keefe's boys, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, where the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan won the home team back in the game again in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt made sure of Cownie's equalization in the 16th minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants brought the lead into the break as he scored his second goal for the evening on the tamp of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard mourned once again for a match with a brilliant goal after 27 played minutes.
Late in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen get the Dundee lead for the first time in the game. He, on his side, secured the victory with the fifth goal of the team halfway in the last half.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, face Milton Keynes at home in the next game, which is on Friday.
Flight leaders lose their lives to ensure that hundreds of planes escape earthquakes
A airliner in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers got safely up in the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disturb the area, and there are many people trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although it swinged wildly.
He stayed again to make sure that the aircraft standing on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower as he believed it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We sent a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in a major city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of casualties will increase to thousands, while the country's emergency relief agency says access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"The number of dead increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we cannot reach," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have destroyed Palu, which is scheduled to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Emergency assistance comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute comes an ambulance with several bodies.
It is difficult to find clean water.
The small shops have been robbed."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross of Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the military In the country: "I ask you all to work 24 hours a day to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports missing man after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating a plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, reports that a man is missing, having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that as of Saturday afternoon they do not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline gave no more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality is unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and the crew after the plane thrust the water when it attempted to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Authorities stated on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Someone witness believed that the plane flew past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to water through the water, which reached them to life, to the emergency exits of the plane before it sank.
He said that the air crew had panic and crook, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said sailors nearby, who were working on refueling a quay, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to land before the plane sank at about 30 metres.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website show that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG registered airlines' aircraft over the past 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analytics make timeline overnight when woman became burned alive
The prosecution presented all evidence on Saturday during the appeal trial for a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He portrayed to the jury how he puzzled recordings from cell phones to find out what happened the night when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett told him that he used localization data from several cell phones showing Tellis to be with Chambers the night she died, unlike what Tellis explained earlier.
When the localization data showed Tellis's cell phone was with Chambers' mobile at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When indicted Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he "laug, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that for a while after Chambers died, Telli's messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information were deleted from his cell phone.
"He deleted her from his life," Hale said.
The defense will end the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
New York children's passports sue couples for fired after "racist" text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple to give her the kick based on discrimination after she received an error-send text message from her mother complaining she was "one black person."
The couple have denied that they are racist, comparing the plaintiff with "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was unhappy when she saw the child caregiver she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she got to work for the first time in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEI, ENDA ONE SVART PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent him to the babysitter Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the unfit Plasco-Flaxman fired child caretaker Maurice, saying that the previous child caretaker, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she would have someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before sending her home in a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for being compensated for being fired. She wants $350 per day for six months for the job she should have had, though it was without a contract, where she would live with her family.
"I want to show them that it's not okay to do that," she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have denied that they are racists, saying that giving Maurice the kick was the only thing they could do after insulting her, of which they were afraid that she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racist," said her husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've insulted take care of your children, even if you didn't mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion," saying his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you really going to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said investor Plasco.
As the case takes place, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, and criticized them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid people would not like a talking bear, revealing new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: "It's hard to imagine how it was to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's very fun to know now how successful Paddington became."
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed feelings during her book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
As for Paddington, as she described as "a very important member of her family," she added that her father was proud of the inside of how great success he made.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never screamed," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real for him, then it was almost like having children achieving something: you get proud of them even if it's not really you who are behind.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creature and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter would die and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter became taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice in a hurry, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to do it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"So Nad called to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be here soon to be with you.
I'll be coming soon.
The medications doctors had given her for her heart to continue pumping was slowly on her way out of her system.
She had already died and now her body was turning off.
I just sat there, knowing this happened.
I couldn't ule or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane along with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"No one knew anything," she said.
"I sat with my head bent while my tears fell."
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women hang patches on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached notes on a bridge in Wales that will inspire and cause people thinking to commit suicide to change their minds and call the numbers on the notes.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began struggling with depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day."
Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said her son was a talented chef with a smile that infected.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile brightened all rooms."
But before his death, he quit his job, for he was in a "really dark place."
In 2014 Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still worried that the little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "for people to know there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone - you have to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has been Davis' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was sorry or depressed or anything," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that he started behaving differently.
He was in the boiler emotionally on 1st Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts he did not look at them once."
She told me that his death was very traumatic to the children, and they continue to work through the trauma: "There is a large void in our family now.
We are completely destroyed.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something that resembled what he was asking for — a limited investigation — then we could perhaps achieve some loneliness," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he is afraid the committee "fold together" in the middle of a partisan-back lock.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The average elections in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans do not do well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then has been Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They are going to run in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh manages to gather at least 50 voices in the Senate. With 50 voices, Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, can give him the last voice and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea "goes down" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean legislator
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Department of Units, saying there were 1,127 defectors last year — compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggler fees are the main reasons the number has declined.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China sees defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, often sending them back with compulsion.
Relations between North and South Korea - which is purely technically still at war - have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the destruction of nuclear weapons.
These conversations come after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not achieving anything since then.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we can't trust our country to be safe, and in such a situation we can't downgrade our weapons first," Ri said in a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically," saying he cannot serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, "hysterically" and said he has too much temper to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterically" in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she had been called "hysterically," Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional and sometimes shouted with lumps in his throat while telling about his family and the years of progressing.
He criticized the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "groteske and a planned assassination on his reputation," organized by liberal politicians who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is prejudiced by Democrats.
"I think that the way he acted on disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi made an objection when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to resign if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this - if he doesn't tell the truth of Congress or FBI, then he can't serve in the Supreme Court, nor in court he serves now," Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge of Washington D.C.'s federal appeal court.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat, she is concerned about potential judges from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In his hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions if he was going to reverse certain rulings in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court expecting us to say he's great," Pelosi said.
And women have to swing the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high company position, who said that she branched when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she branch, "You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm angry."
And then she just continues.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears act as a way to get out the mind, but many people misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I branched out of anger, and a woman who was older than me took me in my neck - she was a cold leader that I had always been terrified of - and pulled me out at the hallway.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and that they water because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressional woman at the time, a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught in being outru on a boat called Monkey Business, and resigned from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought she could as well run for president herself.
"I didn't really think through it well enough," she told me while she laughed, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running for elections, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow white and the seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already preceded for a while, she had not collected enough money, so she promised that she would only run if she was able to raise $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she was not going to run for election anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and aim for the voicers instead of the delegates, and anger against gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
"You should think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said about how the press reacted when she branched.
"You were supposed to believe that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
"She branch?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening ointments of the trade war between the United States and China were island-eyed, and while the battle continues, a rift between the two countries can be an advantage for Beijing long-term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump shot first shot this year taxing important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has seized and put tariffs of between five and ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the United States for each shot they fire off, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to go under with the first.
To make Washington quit, China has to do as the United States wants, but to bow to the United States is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nonetheless, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the American pressure can have a positive effect on Chinese economy in the long term, by decreasing the degree of addiction between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to go under is more dangerous than people have dared to admit before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a mindset.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister says
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily and ask for help to rebuild the country destroyed after more than seven years in war.
When he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is making progress.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terror," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to regain normal areas.
All assumptions are now in place for refugees to be able to return voluntarily to the country in which they had to travel from due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond daily life and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they are not going to accept assistance or help with terms from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe secures signing in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in the Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six consecutive times, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown of that team to the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, struck most of the tournament. He hit the ball in the water from the tee at hole 16, pair 3, and therefore gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players who has ever received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the most winning European by 25.5 points in his career.
"Normally I don't grieve, but today I can't help it.
It has been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believes in me.
I am so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He turns the relay pin on to countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles games on Sunday.
"I feel a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him," Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a merit list of 13-21-3 I Ryder Cup up through his career.
A remarkable statistics from one of the world's best players, who have won 14 major titles and is defeated only by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, stated after a disappointing show from his team. "I am proud of these boys, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we did it hot for Europe.
We fought.
Hats off for Thomas.
He is a single captain
All 12 of his players played very well.
