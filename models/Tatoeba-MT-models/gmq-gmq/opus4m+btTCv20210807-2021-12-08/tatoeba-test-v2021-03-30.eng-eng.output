Are you sure no one can see us?
There is no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom might not have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Has he been in touch with you?
Tom and Mary said they'd be doing that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today is the twentieth of October.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary isn't Canadian.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have kids.
I know Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I think this book is not so interesting.
I was told that this is not a good idea.
I don’t think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team will continue to get better.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom knows he shouldn’t do that.
Tom doesn’t think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It is a big responsibility.
I think you should turn yourself in.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
Tom said she thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom worked together.
Nobody will know I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed more exercise.
Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn’t do that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
I knew Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she shouldn't do that.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn’t know that Mary is in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom's worried.
I wish I had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom was going to be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
Tom said that Mary thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom said he probably wouldn’t win.
Maybe Tom doesn't know I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows everything.
Tom said it's not going to end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn’t do that today.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
The pupils did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind doing that.
You will stay here until you are summoned.
My daughter is being trained.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling fine.
They said they are not ready to go.
Something happened to him.
No one suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
I didn’t know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they've never met you.
Tom is a pretty good painter.
I know that Tom is a picky eater and rarely tries anything new.
Tom says he did nothing illegal.
I suspect Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know Tom knows how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still chatting away.
You're a nerd.
Everyone was late except me.
He could not resist the temptation.
Tom will probably get angry if you do that.
I assumed Tom would agree to do that.
I'm a libertarian.
May I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don’t think Tom will have to do that alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing is not as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn’t want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted he had been rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or New Zealand.
I didn't think we should be talking about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
Tom is a little older than Mary.
Tom didn’t know someone had been hired to kill him.
Tom told me he can't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would like to do that.
Tom said he thought I might not have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that.
Am I the only one who is confused?
I know Tom is a bully.
He is a smartest boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said he thought Mary was not sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn’t get jealous.
I'm pretty sure that wasn't what Tom meant.
It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired of him.
I doubt Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning to go anymore.
Tom has a plan.
It's not what it seems.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he had never planned to live in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
Tom is about the same height as you are.
There is no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said he's glad Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she would have read the book that he had lent her.
I woke up at seven o'clock.
I could have done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't told anyone they're getting married.
They said they planned to go on Monday.
It’s not going to be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't talk so fast, please.
They told me they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn’t tell anyone they had to do that.
I think Tom paid too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worn out.
Tom told me he thought Mary was busy.
I know Tom doesn’t know that Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should have stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could have kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary is not awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to annoy me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything he puts his mind on.
We married seven years ago.
I could have done better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could have done it any better.
I know Tom didn’t do it right.
She is in a bad mood.
I didn’t think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary is better in French than she really is.
Tonight I'm free.
Do you think Tom would have done that?
That's his house.
I am at home.
You don’t have to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should have tried harder.
I thought Tom was going to do that today.
They promised they'd check it out.
I'm sure Tom would have agreed.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said he knew he might have to do that by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It’s not the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters.
Tom must have put up a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance that Tom might get hurt.
Tom said he was glad you had done that.
I always knew Tom was a troublemaker.
Well I never!
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to win.
I am a student, but he is not.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary was going to do.
I wonder if Tom is really homesick.

I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
I wish I was someone else.
I thought Tom had done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just wanted you to know I support you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We are all in serious danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I’ve just cooked an egg for myself.
Have you got a pen with you?
I don’t think Tom will be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary will probably not be able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said they like this time of year.
Tom wants Mary to know she can trust him.
They say they declined that deal.
I know Tom didn't know you couldn't do that.
I’ll stay in Australia for a few more weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
Tom is a close friend of Mary.
I know Tom didn’t know who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wouldn't do that?
I know Tom would probably agree to do that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without any help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans to do that.
Tom could have asked me first.
You're not actually suggesting I go out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should have.
I don't think Tom's bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn’t do that.
I would have done that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary that he thought John was not hungry.
I thought Tom knew that already.
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that.
Tom and Mary swore they'd never hit me again.
Tom said he should have stayed in Australia longer.
Tom said he knew they might not allow him to do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should have left before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I have already told Tom I need to do that.
I plan to stay at home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom's amused by what's going on?
We have not yet begun to fight.
Who's knocking on the door?
Tom is the only one who doesn’t know how to do that.
They said they are supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me they were ambidextrous.
Tom said he thought that what Mary did was a mistake.
I hope no one comes.
I thought everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said he thought Mary was in her bedroom studying.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn’t tell anyone.
Everything's going to be OK.
Tom told me it didn't matter.

I'm twelve.
I'd forgotten about that.
Tom told everyone he was doing that.
They thought there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were happy.
I thought you said you were glad you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little bit.
I know Tom is much taller than I am.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee it's going to happen.
I knew Tom wasn’t very busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom is faster at doing that than Mary.
Tom said that he thought Mary might not be required to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everyone's having a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Tom and Mary both wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
Tom thought it was difficult.
We walked all around the lake.
I don't think it's going to be hard to convince Tom.
They said they didn’t work on Mondays.
I don’t think Tom is as rich as most people think he is.
You will do no such thing.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been thirty years old today if he had not passed away last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know Tom knows I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom is safe.
I know Tom didn't know he shouldn't be doing that here.
Do you know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like doing that.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
You are as tall as my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about it.
Tom has already done enough.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted he was the one who had stolen Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told they had to do that.
We better tell the others.
Why is everyone talking about Tom?
Federer held to love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them to do.
I know that Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I didn’t say anything, and that made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You are a very nasty boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pilaf with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning on doing that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have email.
If something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.
Tom said he hopes you won't want to do that.
Tom said he wished he had not been there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in any hurry.
We may need to be in Australia for a few weeks.
I hadn't planned to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said she expected Mary to participate.
I swim every day.
Who is the lucky guy?
They pretended they didn't know me.
Tom is a little shorter than Mary.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
Tom will probably refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know Tom and I'm not going to do that, right?
Tom and Mary told me they finished doing that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have turned left back there.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought maybe you wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom said he had forgotten something.
She doesn’t like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn’t want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his record at the moment.
I knew Tom knew who needed to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let’s hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
This is not feasible with current technology.
They said they try to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom has already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they were sick.
Tom said he is not allowed to do that.
I assume you're going somewhere with this.

You have a sense of humor, I like that.

It's not something I want to discuss.
Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook a omelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you will be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk anymore.
I wonder if we could do anything to help.
Tom said he'd be willing to help us do that.

There is a certain amount of truth in what he is saying.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom is a slab.
He is not a virtuoso.
I suspect Tom lied to me.
Tom will eventually have to do that.
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30.
Tom has not yet told Mary what he has to do.
I know Tom is a good diver.
It’s not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should have stayed home.
I don’t think this is enough food to feed all of us.
He is not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he plans to be a doctor.
I am disappointed that my friends are not here.
A wolf cannot be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he should've been doing.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't get paid.
Are you worried that this might happen?
I know Tom doesn’t know that Mary did that.
Don’t forget to take your paraply when you leave here.
I'll see to it that gets done.
I wear a suit but wear no tie.
I am as tired as you.
Tom thought he might be coming down with a cold.
Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized right away.
You're lucky you didn't get hurt.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn’t want anyone to get mad.

I can’t believe that Tom is actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We are all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom won’t stop doing that anytime soon.
Have I ever told you about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was thirteen years old.
Tom said he wished he hadn't played chess with Mary.
I know Tom will probably give you permission to do that.
Is it OK if I ask Tom to help me?

Tom may be lonely.
Tom said that he thought Mary was not very busy.
I'm absolutely certain that's not going to happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary is going to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that.
You're very annoying.
I have already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom wouldn’t be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You've finished your homework, haven't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows if Mary likes him or not.
I was lost in the forest.
I know Tom's a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.

I don't think I want to do that here.
Why didn’t you eat the food I cooked?
I know you're afraid of Tom.

Did you know that Tom and Mary had three children?
It's not just a minor problem.
I am not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom has done that already.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should have done that.
There must be a reason why Tom is not here.
It’s not good to be late for a dinner party.

Tom said Mary was frightened.
You should have been the last one to do that.

That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.

No one ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knows that.
Tom said he thought those shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he knew he might not have to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom will be lost.
They told me they were next.
I suspect Tom and Mary are not as eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't ticclish.
I know Tom did that just to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We are sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn’t look back.
I know I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.

I don’t think Tom will have the time to do that with us today.
I know Tom is very opinioned.
We cannot let these starts push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew Tom knew who could do that and who couldn't.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.

Tom is not so sure.
Everyone here knows we don’t eat pork.
Let’s hope that’s the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
I've already told Tom that I don't plan on doing that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It is not healthy to skip meals.
I'm glad to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I suspect Tom and Mary are the ones who did that.
I guess I can sit here longer without saying something than you can.
It's not done yet.
Tom is no longer on the team.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that.
Tom just turned the radio on.
Tom has already decided he's not going to say yes.
I know Tom is a bit snobish.
What's in the box?
Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said he would have done that by himself if he could.
Admitting that there is a problem is the first step to fixing the problem.

I don't think Tom would be upset if I did.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn’t be there.
They said they thought I could win.
Tom means to everyone, isn't he?
Tom is not really in Boston.
I hoped to receive an email from you today.
I thought Tom was unimpressed.
Tom is no longer a suspect.
There's nothing here.
I thought Tom didn't do that well.
I knew Tom would do that right away.
Why didn't you go to Boston?
Tom said he doesn't plan to do that again.
Tom said doing that has made him very happy.
I realize that Tom could get Mary to show us how to do that.
Tom doesn’t think Mary will say yes.
I was afraid I might be late for the bus.
You are not allowed to bring dogs into this building.
Tom and Mary swore they wouldn't do that.
I know I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.

I assume this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I always suspected that Tom was a little paranoid.
I know Tom knew I was going to do that.
You should have been able to do that much better.
We work every day, but Monday.
I know you weren't the ones who did that.
Tom said he has no power to stop it.
Tom and Mary are married.
I should've been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he'd probably cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one there who knew that Tom didn’t want to do that.
I doubt Tom did that for purpose.
I figured you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do that by ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.

Tom is liked by everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you were crazy.
He has no mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that by himself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.

I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does, I will.
Tom is still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they're ready to help me.
Tom is not the one who told me that Mary should do that.
I thought you said you'd still like to do that.

They say they're not planning to go.
Tom's a very nice boy.

Tom is doing something illegal.
Our streets flood when we have rain.
I’ll probably be busy this afternoon.

Suddenly all the lights went out.
Tom and Mary said they’ll probably win.
I think Tom would be annoyed if you did.
Tom and Mary thought they'd find other jobs.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
Tom and Mary are going to do that tomorrow.
I didn't know you knew how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I know Tom does that well.
Tom said nothing had changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know Tom knows I needed to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know Tom's afraid he'll be fired.
If I were you, I would call the doctor.
I was not very hungry.
I've done everything you've asked me to do.
Do you have a tie I could borrow?
I didn't think we'd find anyone who could do that for us.
Tom is not an angel.
Tom is mad.
That sounds awesome.
Tom is driving over to Mary's apartment to give her something.
Tom said he thought Mary would wait.
Tom said he didn't think the smell bothered Mary.
Tom said he's willing to do that for us.
Can you believe Tom is still only thirteen?
Tom sent Mary his picture.
Tom already knows that Mary does not plan to be here today.
They say they have never eaten Thai food.
Tom and Mary have never been to Boston.
They are playing chess.
I thought I heard someone singing.
I heard Tom plans to move to Australia.
It's not as hot here as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I belong here.
No one saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he might win.
Tom had no problems with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know you're not mistaken for someone else?
You should have refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm starting to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said he didn’t want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom should never have been released from prison.
His train arrives at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said that Mary thought that John might be required to do that by himself.
I know what I would do.
He didn't have to bring the paraply.
Both Tom and Mary were not at home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I need to do that today.
Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
Tom told me you were with him last afternoon.
Tom and I didn’t know we were the ones who were supposed to do that.
I am so tired that I can hardly walk.
They felt they needed to do something.
I read a lot of foreign languages, but I don’t speak anything.
You set up a trap.
I should have added more salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I didn’t know Tom and Mary used to be married.
I think Tom's smashed.
Tom and Mary say they will never do that.
I think Tom is sorry.
You were skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could have come home by himself.
Tom and Mary both know who you are.
Mary said she didn’t plan on doing that by herself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were unimpressed.
Tom hasn't yet told us what he needs to do.
I know you probably didn't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remembers where we first met.
If only you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he expected Mary to return to Boston on October 20.
Tom said he thought he might have to do that again.
Tom thinks you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn’t swim.
I knew Tom told Mary that he couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize they are being ignored.
If Tom had left at 2:30, he would have gotten here by now.
Tom and Mary said they would do it.
There is no doubt Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom has decided to stay in Australia for another three days.
Tom said he thought I seemed unconcerned.
I should have stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I'd be able to do that.
I thought Tom would panic.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder if it will snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom is pleased.
I'm frying fish.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that by now if he was really planning to do it.
I know Tom could do that if he really needed to.
We'll never know.
Tom admitted that he had killed Mary.
Didn't you know your taillights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom will never hurt anyone again.
I learn Esperanto very quickly.
You're not going to get into trouble for helping me, are you?
I have heard that women spend more on shoes than men.
Tom will be excited.
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
Tom said he would take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do anything he wants to do.
I thought you were going to fix that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told he's not going to be allowed to do that.
They say they're unsure.
I know Tom didn't know he wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom should have told me earlier.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men apologized to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn’t think John will actually do that.
They say they need to do that too.
I know Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they'd help me.
I don't think I'll ever be able to afford to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn’t speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they're snoring.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tom said he had found something.
A business is not a charity.
Tom said he didn’t think Mary had ever been to Australia.
I don’t think Tom is as good-looking as John is.
Tom said he thought that prices at that store were too high.
I don't think anyone disputes that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn’t remember.
Tom said he hoped he would be able to do that today.
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unconfident.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know Tom is not afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don’t think Tom will be able to do that without any help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
No one asked me if I liked it or not.
Many old people these days can’t keep up with the times.
Tom hoped he wouldn’t be blamed for the problem.
I know Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he'd decided to do that.
It is a kind of cat.
Tom thought Mary would probably refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
Tom denied that he had accepted the bribe.
Tom said he thought that doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
I admit I didn’t do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
Can't this wait until morning?
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
We know that won't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his throat loudly.
I think Tom is unprecedented.
I'm afraid I've lost it.
Tom said Mary was likely to be grumpy.
We are both adults.
They are not as weak as they used to be.
I know Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do that today.
Don’t talk about business while we’re eating.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was tough.
I hope Tom is adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She has to be taken to the hospital.
I would have helped you if you had asked.
All right.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
This is not a drill.
Tom should have done that a long time ago.
Tom slept all afternoon.
I wonder if Tom is upset.
Tom said he knew they might not let him do that at school.
Tom said that he hopes Mary likes to do that.
Tom would have done that for Mary if he had had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something is still not right.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I know Tom's not planning to go to Boston with you.
Tom said he's not sure Mary has to do that.
I didn’t think Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that.
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know you didn't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said he thought it would be fun.
I think you'll find out that it was Tom's fault.
I thought it was rather ingenious.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were the ones who did that?
Do you still plan to do that with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know what time you said you'd be there, but I couldn't be there at the time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that's not true.
Let's assume that will happen.
Tom told everyone that he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was truthful.
It is quite likely that Tom will come.
I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
I didn’t think anyone had tried that before.
You should have made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning to go.
Tom said it looked like Mary was having a really hard time doing that.
I'm learning Old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could have done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard to get along with.
They said they were very drunk.
You could've told me earlier.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceited.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know Tom never does that anymore.
Tom says he only swears when it is absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom's high.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
Tom said that he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me that he thought this book was interesting.
Tom assumed everyone knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he planned to go on October 20.
They said they're doing just fine.
Hostilities resumed between the two powers.
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everyone else in his family did.
I would have done that if I could.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning to do that.
Tom assumed that everyone in school knew he had been arrested.
Tom wished he knew how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he's seen Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said that he thought Mary was going to be able to do that.
I think Tom is the one who is supposed to tell Mary to do that.
Everyone knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My findings suggest that this is not the case.
Tom found the watch he had lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Someone must have left the window open.
I know Tom is a messy person.
I'm sorry, sir.
I know Tom knew Mary was going to do that.
Tom was just stating the obvious.
Tom said he was not offered a job.
Tom didn't know Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he would be able to do that in a few hours.
No one doubts that you will be able to pass the examination.
Where's everyone?
How are you feeling?
Fortune favors the brave.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom had heard us.
It's not compulsory.
I hope no one comes.
What color was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary wouldn’t ask you to do that for them if they could find someone else to do it for them.
Tom said he'd walk Mary home.
It will be hard for Tom to win.
We should have hired someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unimpressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
Tom said he didn’t know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me he was too tired to study.
Where's your luggage?
Both of my parents are musicians.
Live in Groningen.
How do we know that is not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That’s the car I want to buy.
Tom said that he thought Mary would be able to help him do that tomorrow.
I know Tom is a chubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom's going to be willing to talk to me.
Tom said he's happy Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you'd be able to get Tom to do that.
It is not raining.
I can’t speak English, much less German.
Tom thought something bad would happen.
I thought that was what you would have wanted.
I know it's very unlikely anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I both enjoy playing volleyball.
It’s not likely that Tom will ever admit he’s wrong.
Tom said he was unable to win.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that anytime soon.
There's a possibility Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It’s not enough to know only one language.
She is a blonde girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing Mary did.
I know Tom is a sophomore.
Tom knew he shouldn’t have eaten that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that until Monday.
Tom should never have tried to do that by himself.
How's your father?
My son is not a snob.
I would have let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was more difficult than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that alone.
I wonder if it really will be hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you have experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said that Mary knew she might not have to do that again.
They swore they wouldn't do that again.
I don't really plan to do that.
I know Tom will let you do that.
Tom said that Mary would do that.
They've said they won't do that.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said that he thought there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary hadn't done that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn’t know Tom could actually do that.
I didn’t say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would.
Tom said he thought Mary was over thirty.
We went up at two floors to reach the apparel stalls.
I don't think Tom's funny.
Tom thinks he's going to die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know Tom didn’t know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they would be happy to help.
Tom and I both want to go.
I didn't know you'd tell me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I could do that for Tom.
Tom promised that he would never again make such a mistake.
Don't you think we should've talked to Tom about this?
Tom told me he thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me he thought Mary still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the little stuff.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it was a very common problem.
Are you sure this will work?
I'm afraid I'll be tied up all afternoon.
I know you can hear me.
You seemed unwilling to do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought she was doing it wrong, but she didn't care what he thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first-time offender.
I promise you that won't happen.
Tom said that Mary thought he might have to do that.
Tom said he would never try to do that again.
I don't think it ever worked.
Don’t forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom has given me a lot of things.
Tom is a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know Tom can't do that without any help.
Tom admitted he lied to me.
Tom and Mary have told John they don't plan on staying at home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We're not quite sure exactly what we're supposed to be doing.
We both love Tom.
Tom said he hopes you try your best to do that.
I was surprised that Tom didn’t want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that this evening.
I don't think I know the man who's playing the drums.
This old man has liver spots on his skin.
Tom and Mary vowed they'd never do that.
Give me that candle.
Tom didn’t seem to be aware of what he needed to do.
There's no time to explain.
Tom didn’t realize he had to leave.
They said they were afraid.
Tom and Mary say they can't find their hats.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
Tom said there was still a lot of work to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassed.
Tom said he thought he would be arrested.
Tom and Mary told me they were worn out.
I have heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
Tom said he didn’t want to see Mary anymore.
They live in a fantasy world.
They said they thought I was charming.
I didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you'll have much fun doing that.
I suspect Tom doesn’t do that as often as he used to.
I was surprised that Tom didn’t know how to do that.
I plan to skip lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was afraid.
Tom has already told me that he has decided to go to Boston next summer.
That doesn't make sense.
They say they're dying.
Tom offered to lend me some money.
Do you think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea that Mary didn’t know what she was doing.
Tom told everyone he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom is a native French speaker.
They said they were not planning to go.
They say they have taught French.
Tom and Mary are curious.
I know Tom knows I don't have to do that.
You have to help Tom.
Tom told me he had a headache.
The bomb was defused just minutes before it would have exploded.
Tom and Mary told me they'd win, but they didn't.
I'm glad to hear it!
Tom and Mary say they don’t know any French.
I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that.
You should have refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't approve of Tom dating Mary.
Tom said that is not the main reason why Mary should do that.
Tom doesn’t have a car and Mary doesn’t.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he was no different.
Tom admitted what he said was wrong.
Tom could have been scared.
Who do you think asked me to give this to you?
I've just been sick.
I hope I get a raise.
Tom said he didn't think we should even consider doing that.
Tom said he would have come if we had invited him.
I don't think I'll probably do that.
Tom said he could cry.
It's Sunday.
Tom told me he wasn't tired.
I didn’t think anyone really thought Tom was busy.
I think you know we have to do that today.
I didn’t think Tom would actually do that.
I knew Tom would leave early.
Tom said that he thought Mary understood French.
Tom said he needed my help, so I helped him.
I don't think anyone's lived in this house for a long time.
Tom denied he stole the money.
Tom said he hasn't yet decided what he'll do.
Everyone knew Tom didn’t like going to Boston.
Tom said he thought tomorrow would be a sunny day.
Tom is drunk.
I'm absolutely sure that's not going to happen.
Everyone was there except Tom.
I thought you promised to give that to Tom.
I thought you saw Tom this morning.
Tom was supposed to be here.
Tom and Mary said they had fully recovered.
I didn't know you weren't planning on doing that by yourself.
I don't think there's any way out of here.
There is no rose without a thorn.
Tom thought that Mary probably didn’t know that John spoke French.
You know I wouldn't do that.
I think we all know that's a bad idea.
I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
Tom was probably about thirteen years old at the time.
Tom and Mary said they were tickling.
Tom said he wouldn't be able to help weed the garden today.
I wonder how Tom knew I would be here.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was mean.
So, where's the problem?
Tom didn’t think Mary was beautiful.
He will have to do that task again.
I know Tom didn’t know anyone who could do that.
Only fresh roads are sold here.
I think this is not a good idea.
Tom has been asked not to do that.
Here's your change.
This portrait reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
When was the last time you asked someone for help?
Tom doesn’t hate Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny.
I know Tom is annoyed.
I didn’t meet anyone new today.
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I knew Tom was going to do that.
Tom and I both don’t speak French.
I thought you'd be ready.
I know Tom knew why Mary didn't like to do that.
I didn’t think Tom was glad it happened.
They said they were very tired.
You're not old enough to get a driver's license, are you?
I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
I thought you said you did that on Monday.
Everyone here knows Tom is in Boston.
Tom denied he met Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Austria is a parliamentary republic in mid-Europe and consists of nine Bundesländer.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They said they're not thirty yet.
I didn’t think Tom needed to do that yesterday.
I thought Tom was back.
Tom said Mary knew she might not be allowed to do so unless John does so with her.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were pleased.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I thought Mary was cute.
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to do that by herself.
Tom said she thought Mary was happy.
Did Tom say he stayed in Australia?
Tom said he would pay for everything.
They told me they were not alone.
I don't think I can finish the job alone.
Tom said Mary is not safe.
Tom said I looked thinner than the last time he saw me.
They said they'd see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was concerned.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is going to do this afternoon.
Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be cooperative.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary will be scared.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
I knew that Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked him to.
We can't pretend Tom's normal.
Tom's amused.
Tom should never have tried to do that alone.
Tom and Mary said they'd never do that.
I'm taller than him.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was conservative.
Tom said he thought Mary probably wouldn't want to do that on a cold day like today.
The teachers' room and the gym are under renovation.
Do you think there's any chance you'll be able to do that?
Tom put down his glass.
You'd think that would have impressed Tom.
This is the first time I have bought a newspaper in this city.
That's a good question.
Without water, we cannot exist.
Tom certainly understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.
Tom and Mary say they didn’t agree to do that.
I know Tom will be able to help us do that.
I had lunch three hours ago.
Tom said he appreciated Mary's help.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
You are the only one who can protect them.
Can anyone explain this to me?
Did you know Tom was going to be in Boston all week?
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
I know Tom didn't know I wasn't going to do that.
Tom said he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom has a lot of things he needs to do.
Tom and Mary say they're not sure they're ready.
There is no rational reason for this.
I suspected Tom was intoxicated.
I hope I gave you enough money to buy everything you needed.
Tom said he didn't think Mary enjoyed doing that.
They said they felt fine.
I wish you hadn't seen me do that.
Tom and Mary said they had no money.
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that.
Tom should have never got that job.
Tom told Mary that she was his only one.
Tom knew he wouldn't be expelled.
Tom was convinced that Mary did not want to do that.
Tom said he knew that was what Mary had to do.
I think you're terrific.
I wonder if Tom is going to Boston next week.
Tom says he didn't know that Mary wouldn't go to Australia unless he went with her.
I know Tom doesn't want to do that.
You're not an idiot.
I don’t think Tom wins very often when he plays chess.
Tom said he didn't know Mary couldn't speak French very well.
Tom said he knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said Mary wasn't mad.
I think we’ve bought everything we need.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
Tom is an average.
You're not just working for Tom.
Tom said he knew that Mary might be required to do that by herself.
I don't think Tom knows how it happened.
It is not a watch.
Tom and Mary said they're unconfident.
I'm from the United States.
I don't think Tom knows how to have a good time.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
Tom seems unwilling to correct his mistakes.
I loved that book!
Tom said Mary wouldn't like to do that.
Tom said he felt safe.
Tom is homesick.
Did you know that would happen?
I think Tom believed me.
I don't think we can do it by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary wouldn’t do that.
I thought you said we weren't going to do that anymore.
I know Tom doesn’t know anyone who can do that.
I'm pretty sure Tom has a girlfriend.
I thought you might be the only person to listen to me.
I know Tom didn't know Mary didn't do that.
Tom said that he thought Mary would be nervous about doing that.
That’s the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me they were ambidextrous.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped buying a chocolate bar.
I doubt Tom will be excited about that.
I didn't know I was supposed to help Tom do that.
No matter what you say, I’m convinced I’m right.
Tom said he didn't need any more help.
We cannot make a change in our schedule.
I was shocked when I heard that Tom had been arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they're not supposed to park there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not really going to kill Tom, are you?
They said they'd be willing to help us.
Tom told me he had done that.
Tom is not the same as he was thirty years ago.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this today.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary she needs to do that today.
America's Civil War lasted four years.
They say they are disappointed.
It is not always easy to distinguish good from evil.
Tom said he's going to try something he's never done before.
I don't think Tom is strong.
It's not too hard.
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
Tom and Mary are suspicious.
You're a prude.
Tom said he would have done that if he could.
I don't think anyone really wants to do that.
