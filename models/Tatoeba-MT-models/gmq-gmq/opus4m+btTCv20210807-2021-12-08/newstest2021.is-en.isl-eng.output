Crying to the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland is thought to have gone well and shouts and calls out in nature are starting to pull people widely and widely around the world.
“You own the collateral, I need Iceland,” said a woman in the big world in comments on advertising from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another viewer will keep Iceland in his heart for all eternity and a young woman claims to have to get to Iceland as soon as her fiancée lives there.
Fortunately, she is in the United States and expects to wait a few more months.
Still one person asks if the route to Iceland is good because there are no planes.
I don’t know if he comes from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson at Peel’s advertising office, which came to the ads along with M&C Saatchi, said the receptions have been hopeless again.
“I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already starting to record.
Basically, this is about creating a PR-value, it’s getting foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it’s been incredibly successful.
Over a relatively short period of time, we have received a coverage of about seven hundred media worldwide that totally reaches more than two billion people.
The price of this coverage is 1.8 billion kroner.
It's not bad."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, although the Americans are not on their way to the country in the near future.
According to Egils, known market areas such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also welcomed, like Russia, which is pleasantly surprised.
There was a response from outside countries, such as India, which was not specifically proposed.
“These advertisements have travelled farther than we expected,” said Egill, but more than four million people may have watched the content on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have wanted a better start.”
The pictures here at the opening took Árni Sæberg, the photographer of Morgunblaðið, with the marks of advertisements carrying the headline “Let It Out” in the middle of the last month.
The roofs were made wide and wide, such as at the School Guards in Reykjavík, at Reynisfjörður, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at the production of Scotia and the head of the Ottar Guðnason.
The Icelandic characters Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas are from Cuba and Hungary.
Thousands of Icelanders arrived to make the ads, but at the same time as the recordings took place in southern Iceland was another group in western and western fjords.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for Iceland,” says Egill, adding that the partnership with M&C Saatchi has worked extremely well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it’s important to have foreign partners with knowledge in the markets we’re talking to.”
Explosion: Discuss the position in the labour market, pension fund and much more
Asmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Child Affairs, will meet in Sprengisand, starting at 10 o'clock today.
He is also the Minister for Labour and discusses the position in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more.
He also discusses rural issues and transport works out of land that has gone bad and has been disputed in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of the VR, will also attend the show, but he will discuss his criticism regarding the investments of pension funds and presents ideas that labor movement and employers withdraw from the boards of the funds to reduce the risk of interest conflicts.
Then they will be discussed with Ivar Ingimarsson, an Austrian tourism serviceman, and Árnheiður Jóhannsdóttir, Director of the Nordic Marketing Agency, about the status of tourism in the countryside.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading ban on what will come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10 a.m.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
The actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all kinds of teens.
She played as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in the show Sabrina: The Teenage Witch, Melissus Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
Little has been touching her lately, but she got to look over gone way and express herself about Clueless in Australian television on the days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I mostly based the person on girls I met in school who weren’t good at me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan told Clueless.
I didn’t want to leave the police station after a night’s stay.
About fifty cases came to the police board in the capital area today, and in the police diary, the case was widespread.
The day at the police station at Hverfisgata began by the police had to have a breakdown by a man who had been recently released from a prison cell after staying there for drunk driving.
The man did not want to go away after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man continued to stay at the police station because of his progress.
One person was arrested in the morning suspected of a breach in a company in Kópavogur.
Police also had to have a breakdown of two men in Breiðholt due to the announcement of body assault.
It also meant that a woman who sat at a grocery shop in Kópavogur could not pay for the bill at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.
It was also reported in the middle of the car this morning.
The driver of a white Renault automobile was searching for her for a moment, and she was then taken a free hand.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Glory - The Terrible Destiny of the Glee Stars
The theory has reached a flight on the Internet to curse the season about the Gledge Force, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days, becoming the third main actor to let life go a long way ahead of age.
The Glee show is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The episodes dealt with the so-called joy group of young people in high school, their love and destiny.
It was not always taken out with the seal to be in the joy band, but through singing and dancing, the characters appeared to be able to overcome every situation that occurred in their lives.
But outside the scenes, great disasters have raged over the players and employees of the shows, so much that the theories have awakened that the curse of the shows.
Naya Marie Rivera starred as Santana Lopez in the show, a clapper who didn’t call all her grandmother.
After the season, Rivera went to have actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and separated them.
Dorsey, however, refused to file a complaint, and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8 last, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found asleep in a lifejacket on board the boat, and he could report to the police that he and his mother had swimd and Rivera would have brought him back into the boat but never returned there.
It was a great search for Rivera.
The next day, the police officer in the area reported that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later Rivera was found and was officially convicted.
It is believed that she had a lot of power in the water and used her last claim to save her son.
The cause of the death was recorded drunk by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith starred as Finn Hudson on the show, the American football player with the angel voice who played a key role in bringing the Gleade Band to the way and respect.
Outside the scenes, Moneith struggled with personal devils.
At the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and proved difficult to escape from her.
In 2013, his co-workers found enough, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and seemed to all look to a better way.
Just two months after he finished the treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein proved a deadly mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that the intention was to talk.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for drug administration had decreased so much that the dose he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 when he died.
His death was heavily on his colleagues, but under his opposing actress, Lea Michele, was decided to continue taking the episodes and dedicated them to the full memory of Moneith and Finn's character.
Mark Wayne Salling played Noah "Puck" Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Gledesveit, or all until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles suspected of child abuse.
When he was searching at his home, a huge amount of child porn was found, and the case was promptly asked out publicly.
It was clear that Salling had been.
He was subsequently accused and convicted of his crimes.
He had four to seven years in jail, as well as having to be on the record of sexual offenders and seek treatment for childbearing.
Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn’t just actors who fell from far ahead.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He died in his sleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
A woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the star Juliu Roberts, and she did not carry her sister’s beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great control and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her girlfriend, where she claimed that her mother and sister were responsible for how she was doing.
“My mother and my so-called siblings have nothing to do with me except the memory that it was the ones that suffered my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her fellow actors for bullying and aggression at the scene and having a disability astronomer.
Jesse Luken was a guest on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunken driving in 2019, which was a great shock.
Heather Morris has played a major role in the show.
In 2010, it became clear that unrooted hackers were found in nectar pictures of her and appeared on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the show and had a love relationship outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything.
This increases the development of children when they play in the garden with their parents to cultivate flowers and to keep an eye on them growing and thriveing.
It can also be done with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a time with the kids in the garden is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the scent, and of course the precious time they had with their parents.
Buying a boat after 10th grade
“I don’t think we are many seamen who work in the country’s kindergarten schools,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who pursues beach fishing in summer but graduates psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter.”
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I feel great to be able to let go of taking the tuition.
The income will also fit me well into the winter,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychotherapist who pursues beach fishing in the summer as in the past summer.
"Axel was just on a pier at Tálknafjörður when a journalist spoke of him late at night at the beginning of the week."
“The water I was in the tenth grade, I took boarding rights for boats under 12 meters long and I bought my boat the summer after I finished primary school.
I’ve been fishing in my boat since then.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I gave the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat,” Axel said, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“I signed a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
So I had the boat indebted at the end of my first summer.”
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“I had already spent and collected money, I had been working with my dad when I was a kid, I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my money in my boat.”
Axel was born in Isafjörður, from where all his mothers are, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
“I can fish here in the western part because I have a legal house with my grandmother in Isafjordur.
I learned in this area from the west of the rower with my dad.
I'm going to get to a distance depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all the Westfjords.
Although I feel better to be west, I have also provided around the snowfall and beyond.
“I’ve also given for the south, but then preferably a grey drop,” says Axel, who always runs one elder in the morning and sometimes says he talks to the lunar and sings for the sky, in the lonely hour together on the ball sea.
“The internet outdoors is good, so I can call, listen to the blogs and music.
It doesn’t matter to be alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid falling in a hurry, but some times there has been something in the weather, but never much danger,” says Axel, who is lucky that he is never sea sick.
He says the length of the day depends on how the fishing goes.
“I’ve never been fishing more than 14 hours at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I’ve been continuously for one and a half days hunting out on the sea to hunt.”
The coastal fishing system says he can hunt 770 kilograms a day, which he feels hammered.
“Other restrictions are that I cannot hunt Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only hunt twelve days a month, these four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, the sailors should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is for people to calm instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose from their heads.
So the regional shift could also go for me, and sea spaces that are well located at the fishermen should be enjoyed,” says Axel, who draws mostly cod from salted seas on their coastal fishing, but also only ugsa and unique other species float with.
Axel works over the winter season with the college at the Nupe School in Kópavogur.
"I don't think we're a lot of sailors working in the country's preschools," Axel said proudly, adding that he was only meant to work temporarily at the preschool.
“I’m stuck because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that my psychology course will benefit me in the future,” says Axel, who is also a long-runner in business.
Registration error prevented return mystery
An error in the registration form that people fill out when it comes to the country caused an individual, residing in the country, not to be called back into a sampling.
It is not necessary to register a ID number if the person fills out the form in English, as is when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be checked this week,” a doctor told me.
Three domestic attacks were detected at the hospital’s virology department yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on 15 July, two days after the rules on the return myth expired.
The residents of Iceland are screened at the arrival of the country and again invited to the exhibition four to five days later.
In the afternoon, he said that the old man had been in control of the old system.
The display at the border was negative and he was not called back in screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the medical care field, said in a conversation with the news agency that this may be caused by a error in the electronic registration paper.
If people fill out the registration form in English, it is not a requirement to enter a identification number as is in the Icelandic version.
First and foremost, it was thought for foreign travelers.
He did not receive an automatic invitation to take a test.
However, Kamilla says many have followed the rules for returning to the country, though they have filled the registration form in English and in some cases, employers have also been alert to sending people to the sampling again after it arrived in the country.
“This will be considered this week how people can make this easier to draw attention to the process.”
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in an insect.
They all go to a test, but two were starting to show symptoms.
Infection is now in progress with the three infections that were detected yesterday, but it is largely over due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, Icelandic gene analysis has shown that there are varieties of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the bands have focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who moved the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be left tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
In total, there are currently 15 in isolation according to the web COVID.
There are 135 insects.
Four out of five infections are unconnected.
There have been five inland attacks in the last few days.
Of these, four are unconnected and are not yet found the source of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup athletic tournament yesterday.
Sickness is still present.
Originally, in the third ten were uniquely sent to the depot, but they were reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 insects due to these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that infection is detected at a sports event, and it has raised questions about whether such an event should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, the communications director of the General Department of State Police, says it well slowly, as long as people follow criteria and rules.
“We are constantly pressing for all those who live here that they need to maintain individual infectious agents.
We also need to urge people who are holding events that there are certain rules going on that need to follow.
You can have an event,” said Joan.
He says that infection can be prevented by keeping individual infectious agents in the air.
Rules and guidelines are also under constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Health and Medical Services are constantly pressing for people, is to consider these individually infectious remedies.
Both at home and so on.
People are washing their hands and making use of alcohol.
It prevents the infection from going on,” says Johann.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good road we were on in order to sustain the results we have so far reached.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard how hard her father had to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day he was dead.
The death was due to sudden respiratory difficulties due to crown viral infection.
Diabetes was indicated on the death certificate as an underlying problem, and is Brumfield, who also has diabetes, frightened of the fact that the same thing is going to happen.
Reuters says Brumfield’s fear is unreasonable.
According to a recent study by the U.S. authorities, nearly 40% of those with diabetes 2 were diagnosed as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is seen, the proportion increases to half.
The U.S. Department of Disease Prevention (CDC) study included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus in the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, an expert on CDC infection, said the findings were striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Reuters’ slow growth was hidden and the responses from the 12 states responded to comparable proportions.
Ten states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet been detected.
“Illness was already a slow-growing epidemic.
Now, COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful age," Reuters of Elbert Huang, CEO of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of south-American origin, which has also gone worse out of the crown virus.
One of the best remedies for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in check with a gym, a healthy diet, and help healthcare professionals.
However, the coronary virus epidemic has made many people difficult to keep a routine.
Then, high insulin prices have consumed some to keep going to work and thus should be exposed to the virus.
Reuters notes that the U.S. authorities could be aware of the risks that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
When the SARS coronary virus went through in 2003, more than 20% of those with the disease and in the pig population in 2009, this group was three times more at risk of having to go to hospital.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study revealed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, said that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could be longer, the epidemic has deprived of a number of unfamiliar complications.
"I'm afraid we'll see a flood of problems when this is over," said Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Association of Diabetes.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes related complications, including kidney diseases and renal separation.
Likewise, new research directs that the coronavirus may lead to a multitude of diabetes cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then, a high rate of glucose and lipid in diabetes can induce a true cell messstorm, as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged intake cells can also lead to inflammatory formation, which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
“It’s all a big puzzle,” said Dela Cruz.
“It all has to do with one another.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were invited to drink champagne, and then they went out of the room.”
The couple Asrun Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason joined the unusual invitation of the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for the work that the artist was setting up in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t easy.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and grandmother, Asruna Magnusdóttir, for the first time.
“I was very fascinated by her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but it also seemed to me quite unhealthy.
And still," he said.
He also remembers the first time the husband regularly recalls the meeting.
“I’m always hearing this story.
Last weekend,” she said, who also attracted her husband at first meeting.
“I felt and felt so much excitement around the city that I liked.
There’s a lot going on and I’m fascinated by it.”
Atli tells the couple that they have focused on their relationship to go their own ways.
“We don’t tie the same knots as the travellers.
We avoid the routing we're around."
That’s probably why they took the story from Ragnar Kjartansson’s artist just cheerful, though it would be mildly said unusual.
“Christina Anna’s common friend contacts us and asks if we can come to eat desert with her, Ragga and Ragnar’s wife Ingibjörg, on Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the three-pocket on the Snaps, and had a desert wine and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans for an art exhibition that he intended to set up in Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
“He had a multi-channel video called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way.”
Asrun says he has described the work as banal and dekadent tending from the everyday lives of the Western inhabitants.
“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot, and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in joining.”
The Senan that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show young middle class couples to love in a minimal room.
“These are intercourses with the beginning and end,” said Atli.
The couple didn’t know Ragnar much though they knew of him and he of them “but they knew us and felt we fit in this.
They said they didn’t want to announce people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn’t get the right people, but people who got the sexual break from performing for others.”
They voted for Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“When we got out of Snaps, we said, ‘Are we not just doing this?’
It was just that way.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and all his team,” says Ásrún and Atli.
“It’s about love and closeness.”
The house was housed in a nice apartment on the street.
There was a very subtle film theatre; captured, Ragnar and the soundtrack and the pair.
After the shooting, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Ásrún.
“We didn’t decide how we should be.
We got some advice, but we tried to forget the time and place.
Be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn’t the game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says Asrunn.
Was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a bit romantic,” said Atli and Ásrún agreed.
“We were invited to a champagne before they went out of the room.
It was a bit like a vacation in a nice hotel in Paris.”
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved with them.
“When the Tommi took a look at this, he cried, and he thought it was so beautiful,” Atli said.
“This is just as much about the love and closeness as the relationship itself,” says Asrun.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tells Atli that his mother heard the voice in the song at Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts to talk about it,” said Atli.
“My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
“We hadn’t told anyone this, but then my dad just sent me a message and said, ‘I’m glad to come across the little family in Palais de Tokyo,’” Asrun recalls.
Do you think the team will have a deeper relationship with Aarhus and Aarhus?
“We’re still together, so maybe we’re going to do something.
This at least deepened my relationship with the family,” says Ásrún and laughs.
He himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I felt a little hard not to be with you but someone else,” she said, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see it because it’s just one late in a much bigger work, and when you saw it with the rest of the work, it’s really cool.
I could just get rid of it and I was proud.
And there was a little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the second child of the couple when the scene was picked up.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to them asrúna and Atla in Love Stories at Kanal 1.
Swansea with a win in the previous Premier League
Swansea won a 1-0 win at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game in the game to get into the English Premier League.
The game was held at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The position in half was 0-0.
The Swansea residents were sentenced in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew responded by the bubble point and was defended.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, received the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game fewer and in the 82nd minute, Swansea players took advantage of the team difference.
Andre Ayew then added the clue by scoring an excellent goal and guaranteed Swansea 1-0 victory.
Swansea leads the 1-0 in the double, but the second game takes place next Wednesday at Brentford's hometown.
Ambassador for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the American ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS announced this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard where he was afraid of his life.
However, it has not been easy for the US president to appoint an ambassador here.
Since Carol Van Voorst retired from the U.S. Ambassador in April 2009, the country has been ambassadorless for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under strange circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the flagship words.
On her way to a greeting with the president of Iceland, she received a call from the presidential office that she would not be honored the word.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador, but then resigned.
At the time of the job, Loius Ariega had been working in the foreign service for decades.
He retired in the autumn of 2013 and took office as an ambassador to Guatemala.
Then we took another ambassador.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Senate in January 2015 and came to work shortly afterwards, but no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not diplomacy, but he had served as a lawyer and a supporter of Barack Obama’s election fund.
He retired as President Donald Trump took office on 20 January 2017, as usual with a politically appointed ambassador.
Trump’s government was unusually commanding both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the Washington administration system.
It took two years until the U.S. Senate announced Jeffrey Ross Gunter’s meeting to ask him the questions and confirm afterwards as an ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony to the Senate, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who has died, had been broken by Dutch rock.
Gunter is a politically appointed, formerly a dermatologist in California, and has been prominent in the Confederacy of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded them, but Adelson is a strong supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example of this country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s rule was to nominate people in key offices as well as that in recent years the U.S. Congress’s work has drawn a great deal in the long run, including confirming the ambassador’s office.
Since 2009, there has been an ambassador in Iceland for over five years.
However, it has not prevented construction by the embassy which opened a new headquarters at Engjateig.
The constructions are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but noisy safety walls surround the building and shot-helt glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem sufficient to fill the current ambassador's safety feeling because he is said to be afraid of his life and has wanted to get an armed lifeguard.
The former IBV player suffered racism in Iceland: “It was a mistake to come to Iceland.”
Tonny Mawejje, a former IBV player, said he suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to Iceland.
Tonny was released on the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC as the top league in Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about a lot, including his time here in Iceland, but he played with IBV, Val and Development in Iceland.
“When I arrived in Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The team captain was in that position, but he also had the shirt number I wanted, so I didn’t get any of what I wanted,” Tonny said, playing on the right side of the season with IBV.
Tonny’s story is about racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players experience when playing in Europe.
“It happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was told me.
Later I heard about it, and then I asked my friend what it was about.
He then told me that my opponent made a racial comment on me after I took him.”
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He said he made the mistake he saw most.
Tonny had not been able to get to the start team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to return to Iceland for a loan, but he then joined Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland.
I think if I had been longer in Norway, I would have had the chance I wanted,” Tonny said, but he was hoping that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably be able to get further.
He believes that the loan to Iceland has made up his dreams of getting to the big league in Europe.
Found a worm in a woman's neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-inch black worm in the neck gland of a woman searching there.
The doctors managed to pull out the worm with a tong.
The study found that parasites were talking.
CNN explains this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before.
The woman soon improved after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi went to bed in the West, cases where parasites have been caught in people have increased, according to CNN.
Other waves are starting in Europe.
Spain is now at the forefront of concerns about the second wave of the Crown Virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to renew the spread of the Crown Viral Pandemic.
In Catalonia, the entire entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the infection is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action due to the increasing number of infections in Spain, but in the UK, everyone has to go to the shelter when returning from Spain, as in Norway, and French have been warned about travelling to Spain.
Smitum is also growing again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance in replacing the spread of the virus and re-establishing the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to elsewhere in the world, but the incidence of global infections is approaching 300 thousand per day, where most infections are counted in America and South Asia.
Confirmed contagion has reached 16 million worldwide, according to John Hopkins University, and deaths confirmed to be related to the virus are up to 644,000.
Mozambique finally gets to enjoy it to the fullest
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavik is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large grave.
More smaller machines.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the fortress is good, and there many are now observing the artwork of millions of mosaic tiles —like they have never seen it before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least it didn’t respect it.
The work has so far been quite hidden, right in front of there were parking that was always transposed.
People lay there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped into the center of the city.
“Big and diverse public spaces” and “attractive city fires” are a guide to the reconstruction of the safe street that is currently underway.
The goal is to beautiful the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerðir Helgadóttir at Tollhúsið to enjoy a vision better.
Beyond the work, there will be squares and where the area lies well by the sun, it is considered suitable as a residency area for travellers.
The artwork will be illuminated and now the material tree will enjoy itself better than before on these 142 square meters.
In the area there will also be small "dim sprayers", some kind of water sculptures, offering a game and providing the area with a certain mystery.
In this way, the renovations are described by Reykjavik City, which is currently being performed alongside Veitir.
Water supply, heating and electric installations will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their ages, but the wastewater layers and cold water layers are since 1925, and have thus served residents and companies in the center of the city for nearly a century.
When the street is reopened after construction, cars can drive around it again.
However, it will become a single-track street and at the same time create a quieter and more accessible space for walking.
In the knowledge of the Customs House on the website of the Customs Officer, the house was opened in 1971, and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because the harbour struck through the house, there were 250 square meters of windowless wall faces out to the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such a surface would have a negative impact on the overall street image, if no special measures were taken to adorn the appearance of the house.
They agreed to set up a permanent work of art.
During this time, a lot of words were made by Gerald Helgadóttir, a artist, says in the summary.
She had done a lot of musical work in Germany and beyond.
The decision was to contact her first before deciding whether to compete for the work.
Often had been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the harbour, because the port had been the life of Reykjavik since it was made.
When we talked to the artist, she had to be impressed by such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, where she would work with the proposals abroad.
She was given the time she decided to go home, and when she returned, she made a few suggestions for a discussion.
He was immediately asked to do the job.
In addition, it was wanted to make a total agreement with her and the famous artwork company in Germany, Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerður had long worked with them to set up famous artworks throughout Europe.
A contract took place, and Gerður did the artwork under the installation of the workshops of the brothers, who then took care of the installation at Tollhúsið.
The whole work was incredibly well done, both by the Half-Daughter and the Oidtmann Brothers, says in the summary.
It’s been a bit of a Icelandic weather.
It took two years to do the work, which was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the toll house work was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to move more companies to the country
Asmundur Einar Daðason announces that more public bodies will be exported to the country in the near future.
That’s what the minister said in the show Explosion on the Wave at noon.
Recently it was announced that the fire departments of housing and construction will be moved to the north of Sauðárkrók in the fall.
Six experts in the field of combustion work at the institution, but none of them intend to adhere to the North Institute and have criticised the transport of cattle by the Iceland Association of Firefighters and Health Careers.
“I think we should take further steps in this world.
I am preparing for further steps in this world.
Further transportation," said Ásmundur.
He believes that the majority of the people want to see a greater distribution of public institutions around the country.
“I think it needs to be made further political decisions on the transfer of public jobs to the country, as I was doing with the Housing and Construction Agency,” Ásmund said, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been exported to the country and made a significant difference for communities outside of the country, such as the transfer of Food Agency to Selfoss, the Landmarks and the Akraness.
All the most important things from the second day of Championships
94. The Iceland Championship in free sports finished at Þórsvelli in Akureyri today.
A number of matches were placed on the second day of the race.
There was an exciting competition for women at Þórsvelli, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Íslandsmet in 2014, which stood until Elisabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from IR added the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Iceland Championship back earlier this summer and has been in fantaform in the past, but she has tripled the Iceland Championship what is of summer.
Elisabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and hasn’t been struck today.
She had only one valid cast of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last experiment and set a match record.
The Icelandic record she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters, and she was a bit from that.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir of Ireland had the second best pitch of the day, but she improved her best performance with a pitch of 50.18 meters.
In the men's team, the FH winner Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic Meteorological Championship, won a safe victory, but he pitched 73.84 metres in his next last pitch and set a championship record.
His Icelandic record in the industry is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, the Olympian and the Iceland Meteorological Championship, won a tournament on Thorsvelli yesterday, but today he competed in a tournament, which is his main article.
Guðna Vals is 65.53 meters, but he pitched 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson pitched the next longest day, but he had a valid pitch that worked in the second place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Iceland’s longitudinal Icelandic Meter, won the longitudinal race, but Hafdís leapt the longest 6.25 metres a day, which is just under 40 cm from her Iceland Meter.
In the 200-metre women's race, it was the Irish team Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was stubborn in 24.04 seconds, but her Icelandic record in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was a winner in Akureyri, winning two gold prizes yesterday, a 100-metre race and a 4 x 100-metre biking race and a 4 x 400-metre biking race today.
Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first in the 200 metres race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samuelsson from Årmann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 metres of yesterday as well as in the 400 metres race.
Don't get a fine for $27 million Bitcoin harvest
The over-tax committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who demanded a guilt on a person for misleading his capital income that was available for sale of the electric coin Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not given clear evidence of why it was necessary to fine the man.
The Committee’s decision states that the tax investigator considered the person to have the status of a materially wrong tax statement for the 2016 and 2017 income years.
He would have deferred his capital proceeds that would have come due to the sale of the Bitcoin electric coin up to 27 million, either deliberately or by magnificent herdlessness.
The man is accused of his behavior.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
In 2016, he sold an electric coin for $27 million.
She would have had a grave in 2009 and 2010 when it had been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electric coins, tax performance due to such sales had been substantially vague and unpredictable.
It would have been hard to assume that public citizens would have made such a decision on tax returns.
He would not have intended to avoid paying taxes from the harvest and would have reported his asset on a tax return as a deposit on the currency account.
He would have asked both the Citizens and the Treasurer how this would be done, but without success.
Then he thought he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
He would have been in a worse position than others to find out more complicated rules that the tax authorities would not have made a clear view on.
The man therefore believed that his taxes for these two income years would be re-determined and stressed, but otherwise not made punishment.
He said he had been living in Iceland and had been paying taxes since 2012.
He would never have intended to escape his duties in an unsatisfactory way.
The demand for a fine would be out of all means and would plunge him into debt.
“This man knows what football is.”
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been considerably between the teeth of people, but also impressed because of his progress what remains of the season with Breiðblik in the Pepsi Max Division.
This is the first time they will be on the IA in a live broadcast at Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes out the playground because of four reminders during the season and does not come to play with a new clip as in summer games so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but talking about the character, this one was better trying in the game.
He was not hiding.
He wants to get the ball every time and if there was someone going to balance this game, I thought he would do it or make it,” said Guðmundur Benediktsson, a Pepsi Max boy.
“I have to be here for the people.”
Sometimes it’s hard to figure out where he is.
He looks a bit out on the left when it starts to feel at the game, but he has a very free roll in the team,” said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson tells Brynjólf a real entertainer and welcomes to get such a colorful man in the league: “No one shares that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to be always ready to meet and respond in interviews.
There’s a lot of people busy with him who tells me that this man understands what football is.
“I am an entertainer.
I have to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynjolf, people are paying in and watching what’s next on his hair.
“This man is just a genius,” he said.
Player KR says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in touch with some teams in the B-League"
Tobias Thomsen, a player at the Pepsi Max, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to reach the start of the period in his home country, but for that purpose he must first terminate his contract with KR where the Danish Division begins before the Icelandic odds.
The company knows I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding,” Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
“I’ve been in touch with a few teams in the B-team and I’ll probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
“There are not many people in Denmark who can afford to pay off my contract with KR.”
Then he says he probably needs to take a pay cut in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably felt more for the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
The biker Bjartmar has recovered a bike for millions - Answers now after review DV
For more than a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had interests unlike most others.
He covers up and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles and vespers.
Bjartmar has earned the name "the cycling wrestler."
Yesterday there was a lot of hope when you wrote a story about your relationship with Bjartmar.
In a discussion with the Facebook group of West Coasters, Bjartmar said he had taken the man to the East Coast and said the vesper could be stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the escort but that Bjartmar had stolen him.
The texts have now been modified on Facebook and the title of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the original news of the case is not describing what was actually going on yesterday in the East.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victims of electric scooters that this was truly his own electric scooters.
This information received a suspected owner from others, but the information proved false, says Bjartmar.
“I saw the guy and I was familiar with the shuttle, with the information that there was an electrician who had been missing for a long time and had been searching for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him prepare to drive on the shuttle, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
“In general, I’m doing very well in such a case, but before I finished what I had to say, the man had taken off me.”
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric wheel has asked him to show him the receipt for the bike and have himself called to the police.
“Yes, great,” said Bjartmar, “just let’s get it straight.”
Then the owner of the electric balloon proved ownership of his electric balloon and ran off.
Later, the right owner of the electric bulletin reported his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In this more than a year Bjartmar has been engaged in this practice, he says he can count the times he encountered with people on his fingers on one hand.
“I’ve had a peaceful relationship with the hardest men in Reykjavík,” Bjartmar said, pointing out that bike thieves are the most often smallest brothers and sisters in the community, addicts, mentally ill people and other people on the street for some reason.
“The drug is a hard master and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, unfortunately the thief on such a loose ground is an easy way to achieve that goal,” Bjartmar says.
“My relationship with these people is really so good that I’ve come with a lot of the good people with me.
“There are examples of people going to treatment and taking care of me and then looking to help me with what I’m doing,” he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s communication with cyclists is on polite notes.
Some people know about him and what he’s doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, custody numbers, and so on.
Cycling is a big problem that has little been dealt with.
In addition, Bjartmar says the police are even starting to point people to talk to him because of stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar disagrees with the previous DV news and does not claim to be any self-directed police in a personal search for justice.
He asked if he was still not on the tail of his activity, and if this is not the first role of the police, Bjartmar said.
“Of course the police are doing this, but the fact is that the police aren’t doing it.
I have to make a look at the policemen driving away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She’s really unhappy about these things.”
“When the police aren’t doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this class, then why not?” Bjartmar asks.
He said he had so great success in having stolen wheels, that sometimes he encountered his "schoolers" on the street that they had just right the Bjartmar wheels they had previously reached.
The time Bjartmar has called for the help of the police has come for her to not come.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owners of the bicycles to blame,” Bjartmar said, and I’m sorry that the victims of the cycling thieves have to feel for the unhappiness of the police in this category.
About the success of Bjartmar is not divided.
Many people are thankful for having recovered their possessions.
Bjartmar has long lost the number of cyclists he has returned, but the sums are likely to run on millions, if not millions.
Roads where electric motorcycles, electric bikes and electric motorcycles are heavy, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works every day in kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a community.
His bike search is an unpaid job he does in his free time.
Long life and long shadows
In 2019, there was a lot of anniversary in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
In the 19th century, officials had received a pension from the King of Denmark, but in 1919, the pension fund was established by officials who eventually became the pension fund of all officials.
The basis for the current pension funds of general wages was then laid down by the general merger agreements on the labour market in 1969, which provided for an occupational pension fund with a compulsory and valid fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were laid down on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to grow thereafter.
The unemployment system was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century pushed forward with its nuclear struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been similarly acquired in historic strikes in 1955, and the organization also gradually received its demands on sickness rights and health care, significant leave rights, the shortage of working hours, improvements in housing matters and other things as a big deal.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle, but proved to be, much more and more permanent remedy than the increase of the ears in the wages cover, which disappeared equally hard in the zesty that implicated the post-war period until 1990 as many people remember.
The advocate of the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
In the end, even though the Funds would actually be the property of a fund, the Labour Movement had to agree that their boards would appoint representatives of employers and fund partners equally.
In the next few years after the foundation of the Fund, the demand for the majority of the employees in the board of directors often came to debate in the association of workers, but it never came to work, and therefore we still sit up with the abnormal arrangement that representatives of the funds are not in the majority of the board of directors.
Article 36 of the Act No. 129/1997 on the mandatory guarantee of pension rights and the activities of pension funds covers the Fund’s investment policy.
According to the first paragraph, “the pension fund must be a guide to the interests of the fund.”
Also, in the fifth paragraph, “The pension fund shall set itself moral standards in investments.”
The shareholders' policy includes the following provisions, in the course of the above-mentioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the UN PRI for Responsible Investments, as well as many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the West Sea and in Europe.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to the improvement of investment-intensive stocks.
In this way, the interests of investors and the goals of society come together in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those listed on the stock market, adopt a public policy on: maintaining good governance of social responsibility and the environment.
The Pension Fund Value, which is with the largest funds in the country, has established a “policy of responsible investments” and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all remembered here as the introduction to the latest fashion word Icelandic, "shadow management".
Since the word is new in the case, it is not hoped that it has been defined for the sake, but I think the following definition is now "most taken": Shadow management is when a leader in a union says in the media that he intends to send the representatives of the company in the board of pension fund recommendations or instructions on how to take a position in a particular case.
If they do not follow the recommendation, they will be departed from the board at the first convenience.
If the leader does not do this in the media and does not talk about termination, however, it is not “shadow management” because, of course, there are such communications between people all the time in the financial world as elsewhere.
I’ll let the reader think about what his way is “shadowing.”
There are, in particular, two men who have tried to shape this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.
These are the journalists of the newspaper Hörður Ægisson and Asgeir Jónsson’s CEO.
The occasion of both occurred after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company’s contracts with airlines and air carriers (say them up), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of the Commercial Association of Reykjavík, sent them recommendations to the company’s representatives in the Board of Life insurance business.
A few days later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and after that Ragnar Þór went the same way with his recommendation, which of course was based on the decision of Boga.
Nonetheless, they saw Hörður and Ásgeir a reason to discuss the matter in the Friday newspaper with great words about shadow management, violations of law and the rich need for changes in law.
There, a little dove really had to overthrow a heavy load though the blessed dove had been connected and also been wiped out quickly.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter itself at the end.
I have already discussed the issues of the law on pension.
This means that the fund boards must take care of the interests of fund partners and have ethical criteria in investments, and these issues are further discussed in the terms of both the value and the pension fund of merchants as I mentioned.
However, pension funds shouldn’t look at only short-term income bills in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous trend and do not have to look for such a long time in the past, as large bank loans and funds have flown to immoral adventurers and environmental soda, with terrible consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on the slopes when he thought he was going to wipe out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the welfare that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw it and pulled it back.
Time reveals whether it is sufficient for an investment of pension funds in the company to be considered liable to the funds when standing up.

One of the infectious people did not return to the hospital.
One of the three who was diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic state on 15 July last, about one and a half weeks ago.
He is an Icelander who is not a permanent resident here and therefore did not receive clear instructions on taking a so-called return impersonation after arriving in the country and going to another exhibition a few days after arriving.
He got a negative from the border screen.
“But he’s in the Icelandic community and really should go to that resort,” says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist in the field of health care at the Department of Veterinary Medicine and a substitute for a health care physician while he’s on a summer vacation, in a conversation with the Newsletter today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered, you are not automatically announced in the second view.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, but because of his connections in the country as an Icelandic he would rather have used it Icelandic.
But he did not realize this.
“When the ID is not registered, you need to seek it yourself to come to the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realized that this was the right way,” Kamilla said.
“It is clear that we need to promote the information on this while we find some way to do an automatic service system even though Icelanders do not register their identity number.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system,” she explains.
Fortunately, however, few people are surrounded by the arrival of the country even though it is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, staying Icelandic.
Only six have been sent to the hospital after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They’re going to take a sample, but two of them are starting to show the symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative test at the border on 15 July.
Kamilla is likely to say that he was recently infected with the virus that she had not yet been able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
“It’s not quite possible to argue that this is certainly an imported infection because it’s been a long time since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here, like those two who have caused a little crash in connection with the sports tournament.”
She says it’s very unlikely because of how few people are here.
“It’s really very unlikely,” Kamilla says, but notes that it can’t be excluded until Icelandic gene detection has been arranged in man.
“If we get a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that he brought it to the country.”
Pepper sprays and bombs attacked against protestors
There was a conflict between police and protestors in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and unarmed handguns, but the protestors broke the rudder and burned on.
45 protestors were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of protests in Portland, Oregon State.
In Austin, Texas, one protestant was shot dead.
As stated on the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
Thousands of people in Seattle gathered together in peaceful protests.
A group of people then burned into a building area and broke the buses in the town’s courthouse.
The police said the protests were disrupted and there was a conflict between the groups of protestors and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was assassinated by police in August last year, was remembered by protestors.
A car ran through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black guards came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was assassinated by police at his home in March.
The group carried guns and joined forces at closed crossroads where police separated the group from a group of people protesting the protests and also carried guns.
75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protestors recalled James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was assassinated by a white barigator in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Manchester United's football manager, doesn't want to make too much of the role of Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, Chelsea won’t lose against Wolves, Solskjær and his men end up in 5th place, losing a Champions League seat.
However, they still have the hope to get to the Champions League by winning the European Championship next month.
“We are not at the end.
If we reach points against Leicester, I think people will say we haven’t had a bad season now,” Solskjær said.
“But whatever happens, it’s not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of land reaching the two teams above us,” Solskjær said.
It’s clear that people’s nerves are getting into the mouth at 15 a.m., but Solskjær tried to pretend to be about each other’s game.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and the company is based on it.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it’s ours to make use of it,” Solskjær said.
“It’s not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many hours to define this period."
“Come Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I think we’re in better shape and much stronger spiritually than in the last season,” Solskja said.
65,000 infestations in the sun
65,490 new coronavirus infection was detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic in the country.
900 people were killed by the virus last four days until more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 on 15 August.
Fear of the second wave of the epidemic
Governments in Spain are now trying to recover from the increase in COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more have been reported in one day since the beginning of May and the reports come at the same time that the Spaniards begin to eliminate one of the strictest exit bans in Europe.
The backlash led to the British authorities now obligating passengers coming from Spain to go to hospital on their return.
A week before, Spain was on the UK's list of safe states.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where governments have taken wider limits to try to match the level of interest.
In the capital of Barcelona, the entertainment will be closed for the next two weeks and the wavehouses will be closed at midnight.
It is now in force for 200,000 inhabitants in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision of the British will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy that relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly played after the epidemic.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel agency, cancelled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but little interest seems to be in taking back to a comprehensive exit ban that has widely destroyed the economy.
Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken very badly into it, similar to nuclear weapons he does not want to use.
The Prime Minister of France, Jean Castex, said that the nation “would not survive, economically or socially.”
Hopefully many councillors to the local resort that covers the inhabitants of individual towns, towns or regions will suffice to keep the virus back in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic attacks were detected yesterday as well as two additional borders.
Five people with positive Covid-19 were diagnosed in Iceland yesterday.
According to a public notice, one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent in isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him in a ward.
The infectious person was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavík and is, according to the announcement, “only part of the sports team” in an infestation.
Others who were sent to the hospital are related in a different way.
The origin of this contagion is unfounded and the contagion is fully carried out by the police department.
ReyCUP contenders have adhered to the instructions and regulations of the CV that are still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
However, photographs of the tournament drew attention, seeing in a very close commune to celebrate their good standings on the field.
Just before 11 p.m. today, the hosts posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says, “Parents, please respect the rules that competitors take their own stuff to school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
“Thank you for a visionary understanding.”
Another infection was diagnosed yesterday but related to the infection reported yesterday.
“The Icelandic gene analysis has identified the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been diagnosed here before.”
Infection is also processed in this case and is the infectious insulating and 12 insecticides due to the infection.
The third infection is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was detected in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in a ward.
Two of them are already starting to show the symptoms of virusmits.
In addition, two were detected at the border and are waiting for the conclusion of further research such as the infectious procedure at the border.
Finally, the announcement states: The General Department of State Police and the Office of a Surgeon urges people to take care and pay close attention to individual infectious remedies.
If the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus exist, the same person is asked to go to the next health centre.
Patreksfjörður says the camp site booked for shopping weekends - Direct guests other
The campsite in Patreksfjordur is fully booked this weekend, according to the Westfjords announcement.
Guests are advised to check out other accommodations.
Nefnir Vestbygd Bíldudal, Tálknafjörður, Melanes á Rauðasandi, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík as other options in the position.
There is enough to be on Patreksfjörður this weekend, because as last year, Skjaldborg, the Icelandic documentary festival will be held in the city.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the city.
From the application to the camp site to be judged, a good attendance may be expected this year, if the weather does not set a line in account, but DV said earlier today a deliberate prediction.
You can expect the worst weather on the south side, and hope for the Patreksfjords.
The website bb.is first told me, and said that all the other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
The best place to stay in the city
Romanian workers live free in Dunhaga 18-20.
In the meantime, owners are seeking a building permit for renovation, but their work has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, most prominent and most expensive neighbourhoods in Reykjavík, there is a tremendous multi-storey house on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house are two stairway doors, each of which holds four rather challenging apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, although most of them are over 100.
The house has a lot of history.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted video rentals, the Shoe Hall, the milk shop of the Milky Sales, the Joa Gunsmith, the fish sales and now last University Print.
The house has, as far as it is concerned, remember its fabulous beauty.
The house is now under heavy damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are according to the company list among others Magnús Magnússson and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús went to the ownership group of the Borgir and was the defender of the holding company Borgir.
The owners of the holding company are Steelskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is the investment company Gudrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Goddess is also the owner of a third part of the D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, August Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once ran the company Steelskip.
The house was purchased in the summer of 2009 and has not been maintained since then.
Neighbours say that the situation of the house has deteriorated steadily since, though most recently.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood, one resident said the house was “not very vibrant last year.”
There may be a sign that the owners have been attempting to change the house and the plot for several years.
Other neighbors say the house hasn’t been ok for a long time.
"It's a long time to do something good about this spot and it's boring that it's gone like this."
He also says he’s angry with the owners of the house for not having driven himself to finish this, finding someone in common with the neighbors of the house and stopping this “lawyer.”
“Just do this in consultation with the community around so that you can get it done and finish it.”
The “Lymology App” that is ready is the planning process of the field that has been running at least since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were abolished by permission to build a floor on top of the current residential house and behind the house, a new lifthouse and an annex on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that implementation was appealed to the Committee on Environment and Resources and the Committee repealed it, since the implementation was not supported in a subdivision and a neighbourhood announcement was not satisfactory.
The city of Reykjavik then started a divisional organisation work and finished it with an advertisement in the Board of Directors in July last year.
The committee was also responsible for this and resigned it in March 2020.
At this point, almost three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the house at the starting point.
The house had hit down a lot during this time, and neighbors were starting to get tired.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house out to the situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the house’s owners, others didn’t.
Others are angry with the city, others don’t.
Others were angry, but none of them.
Others said the parking lots were troubled, but neighbors have used unused parking spaces from Dunhaga 18-20 under their vehicles.
One of the defendants in the case said that he was tired of the administration:
“To have to go through the process at three times is absolutely incredible.
“It’s like Iceland doesn’t know how to read.”
Today the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial of the city’s facade of administration and the noble expectations of the owner and many years of the work of those who are now on the starting ground.
When a journalist walked to the park on Dunhaga 18 he was exposed to a galoped door and spam.
Playstation computer and new TV were located in another junk on Earth — the victims of Icelandic summer blemishes.
It was open to the old university office and a lot of cats from the campus to judge.
It is clear that someone has gone around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of couchs and beds and some pallets of geology pages, which would undoubtedly become a book, you’ll notice.
The apartment buildings were also open and living in both of them.
A journalist was so fortunate to meet one of their people.
There, Romanians cooked potatoes for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and emulate sources of DV that the company has nothing to pay for the house except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not appropriate to collect rents.
From a post in the lobby of the house to judge, it is clear that there have been a lot of foreign workers living in the last few times.
The operation of an employee hire has not gone unnoticed by the Covid-19 situation, as the decline in tourism led to a contraction in the construction sector and these two industries were the most capable of utilizing the service of a employee hire.
Nevertheless, residents at Dunhaga 18 appeared to have enough to do and hung the labour gaps and gallows in the community to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that, despite the miserable situation of the house, the apartment that the boys seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist told the boys Romanian, his irony suddenly became clear: At the best place in Reykjavik, 1,500 square meters of real estate stands down.
Owners want to change the house to be improved and neighbors want to improve the state, but share the definition of “bats”.
Between this, the city’s organizational area sits on the starting ground, the victims of endless appeals and the allegations of the organizational process and the divisive resolution of the Committee on Environment and Resources.
In the house there are such Romanian workers, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article originally appeared in the weekend paper DV on 17 July.
In the fight against obesity following a coronavirus epidemic
Britain’s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will give £10 million in a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on fast-food advertising, as a result of being seriously weakened, partly due to his weight.
Johnson presents the campaign, which has been called Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their clients in overweight and will also be attacked in the fight against the increase in cycling pathways.
Then, ads will be banned on television before 21 p.m., according to the British media.
“COVID-19 has raised us against the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier diets.”
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was placed on intensive care when he was infected with the coronavirus in the spring, and is partly his weight because he is thought to have been so seriously weakened.
Women are better off leading the change.
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation can take towards greater distribution of power, transparency and in combating corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change the gear a bit now and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group of society that makes it easier to be in these values.
“There are women,” Helga said.
“The women in Iceland are famous for their women’s association.
Standing together to lead change.
Now it’s time for us to make these changes.”
She said she was a bit alarmed about the emphasis on Iceland as "best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
“We aren’t as ready to see what to do.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and explore everything that needs to be done.
There are lots.
We need to know where we come from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of remote groups.
“We don’t have the same rules here,” he said.
In response, she said women are in many ways in good practice in Iceland, but added that, like many other places, Icelanders are building at very masculine values.
She said that politics was shifting to forming about their own interests, dominance, and powers that were the forces that maintained discrimination in all societies.
“Women are now starting this group and coming together and just getting a little bit annoyed that Parliament is going to move to overlook this referendum since 2012,” she said.
“It’s the feminine value we’re thinking about.
From human rights and natural protection, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table,” she said, adding that the above-mentioned values were the basic values of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural poverty and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change differently," Helga said.
“It’s ridiculous that there’s a natural law that women’s jobs are always less paid.
“It’s ridiculous that flightgirls and nurses must end up in a caravan fight just to get a human-appropriate salary.”

Trying to take a walk in the city.
A man was arrested in the middle of the night after he threatened walkers and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped drug production in Årby, where two were arrested for the case.
Then the police stopped the motorcycle in the slopes where its driver was at 146 km speed where the maximum speed is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to spin last night and there were over 80 cases recorded in the police journal from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise due to this.
On Saturday, there were reports of eleven noisey meetings, and it seemed to be a lot in the police journal.
Last night, there were 22 noises on board the police.
Six people were saved in a prison cell last night.
The police were called out last night when they fired fires.
They had to go away when police officers were on the road.
Nine drivers were stopped for alcohol and drug use.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city centre last night, one of whom was saved in a prison cell.
Then two were moved to an emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the center of the city and the other in the western city.
One was transferred to an accident department after he was injured by jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who pulled a caravan at Kararnesi yesterday.
The caravan’s wheelchair was, according to the police journal, in “very bad condition” and it was still.
You can stay in Monet's house for the merchant sanctuary
The house in which the impressive Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice is now available on the Airbnb page.
The next night in the house is about the shopper's weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone wants to rent the house, they will have to rent at least two nights.
Based on the Airbnb page, it is next to be released in a week, on the Sunday of the shopper's weekend, and therefore it might be ideal for some shoppers on holiday to hurry to book the painter's house.
The two nights over a merchant sanctuary cost only US$964 or just more than 130 thousand Icelandic crowns as the newspaper reaches the next.
Thousands of people in an epidemic and some of them are starting to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the crown virus.
Five people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus within the last three days and are mostly unconnected.
Some of them have been diagnosed with this disease, and some of them have started to show the symptoms of the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus inside the country yesterday and two with border discrimination.
An expert at a doctor’s office says that an increasing number of domestic injuries does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading wider into the community.
“There has been a series of reports from the previous interior and there is a virus that has not been seen here before so we have no special reason to think it has been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now,” said Kamilla Sigríður Josefsdóttir, an expert in the field of medical care.
Most of the infected have been associated with individuals who came from abroad.
Further samples are carried out in the near future than some who were in contact with the infected are beginning to show the symptoms of the coronary virus.
“Now there is no flu going on and less about other respiratory infections so we can be quite liberal about doing these tests on individuals who had found reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Inflammation is mostly complete, but it is not possible that more people need to go to the hospital.
Two of the infectious people were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
It has raised questions as to whether such an event can be held.
Public relations officials say it very slowly as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
Kamilla says almost impossible that the infectious people were infected at the sports tournaments.
“If no more people are isolated from these individuals after passing them at these sports tournaments, we can claim that our antidepressants at the tournaments have worked.
“It’s not revealed,” Kamilla said.
The general public health department is constantly reviewed.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if that seems to be a reason,” Kamilla said.
Within a week, there will be thousands of people.
This new situation could affect the situation.

Conflicts Between Police and Protestants in Seattle
The Washington State city authorities have declared a state of rebellion following massive protests in the city centre.
Yesterday police seized a blaze and pepper spray to tempt to rust up a large area that the protestors occupied and stretched over many houses in the vicinity of the parliamentary house in the city.
Police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protestors had been arrested and that the investigation was carried over to a damaged police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that protestors stoned police with stones, bottles, bullet bombs and other loosely, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were done.
The protest in Seattle was peaceful for a long time.
The blast was for them to show protestors in Portland, Oregon, where the city has repeatedly encountered harsh conflicts between the protestors and the heavy-armed federal police forces.
Like in other cities in the United States, people gather under the marks of Black Lives Matter, Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25th, protests systematic racism in the American community and demands remedies.
Not revoked until after voting
It is not yet clear whether the cancellations of Icelandair, which will take effect for the next month tournament, will be revoked.
The Icelandair Airlines Association’s Electro-Airline Voting Agreement on behalf of Icelandair will end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairman of the company, is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the withdrawals until the result of the vote is reached.
“It’s all right,” says Lieutenant.
"There have been no withdrawals, this has to be left behind so that the human machines can be made possible.
“Of course, people are unhappy to know if they’re going to work after the month.”
The agreement was signed a week ago, on July 19.
It is expected to enter into force until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract previously signed by airlines.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Confidential Council of Iceland agreed to announce Icelandair’s general posture, and the members agreed to vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided in the wake of Icelandair’s decision to cease negotiations with the Flight Virgins Association, terminate all of its flight companions and seek contracts with another union.
Then, the company's pilots should take care of the work of the security officers on board temporarily.
Ask how she thinks the vote will go, says Guðlaug Líney hard to tell about it.
“People are injured after Icelandair’s assault when all the company’s airlines were terminated and announced that the agreement would be negotiated with another union.
It will be clear if it has an effect,” she said.
940 airlines worked at Icelandair in late April, but 900 of them, about 95%, were discontinued.
Their resignation period is different, with those who have the shortest working life when he is three months and therefore ends at the monthly meeting of July-August.
90% of Icelandair flights.
What does the contract not accept?
“We want to continue to talk to our clients.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it’s clear that the airlines have gone too far.”
Vote for a collective agreement will end and Icelandair will announce a second quarter of the year tomorrow.
The vote for a new coaching agreement will end at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair’s settlement for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but the preliminary results indicate that the company’s income has declined by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The Iceland Airlines Association’s electric voting agreement began on Wednesday, July 22, and will end tomorrow, Monday, July 27th, at 12 o’clock.
Those who may vote for the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay social fees to the Flying Virgin Company.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new consolidation agreement on Sunday on 19 July, but on Friday Icelandair had dismissed negotiations with the company after the airlines coaled the previous agreement in a referendum in early July.
Then Icelandair had told all the airliners and airliners of the company on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new merchant agreement was signed.
According to a new deal, flighters need to fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The nuclear treaty is valid until 2025, and the provisions of the pilots and airlines have been integrated in how long to fly on one shift.
The agreement was introduced to members of the FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, describing a number of flyers that the news agency discussed with them over dissatisfaction due to the agreement.
However, most people seemed to agree that the contract would have to be agreed to keep the FFU alive.
The Icelandair settlement for the second quarter will be presented tomorrow, but the EBIT company, its operating performance for capital and taxes, is, according to the interim clashes, negatively about $100 to $110 million or about $15 billion Icelandic krona.
Icelandair sent the Stock Exchange provisional calculations last Wednesday, which said the company’s income amounted to about $60 million in the quarter or about $8.3 billion.
In the end of the quarter, there was about US$154 million, around $21 billion.
Icelandair also aims to offer the company’s shares in August.
Icelandair intends to complete contracts with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of a month before taking part-financing.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“New virus means it’s just a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been grinding here in the country,” says Már Kristjánsson, a medical technician at Landspítalen’s Department of Infection, about the fact that “new type of virus” has been diagnosed here in the country.
Three inland attacks were detected yesterday and two on the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in a sports club's social career at the Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection was unfounded and infectious.
There was also an infection in a person who arrived in the country on 15 July, and there were two who were in contact with him started showing the symptoms of COVID-19.
Then, yesterday’s infection was detected related to an infection reported yesterday, and after the Icelandic gene analysis revealed “a new type of virus that hasn’t been detected here before.”
Inflammation is completed in relation to this infection.
It is not a new virus, it is the same virus and has spread around the world, namely the new SARS-CoV-2.
It is more right to talk about a new variant of this virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could say something about the start of a different wave of epidemics, Már says that it is as if there is a single case and it could be so that there will be nothing more of it.
“But if there are cases of non-relationship from abroad that have the same genotype as this particular variation, then it would be possible to draw that conclusion [at the second wave] but it is premature to do so,” explains Mair.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to the Iceland's happiness hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC’s programmakers are likely to lead to a fun video that sheds light on the country’s swimming and hot tub culture.
Icelandic bathing culture is special worldwide, and it is alleged that nowhere in the world there are as many bathing places for each population.
The natural geothermal is the base of it, but also the tradition of division that prevails here.
Children’s swimming was legalized in 1940, but older citizens are no less effective at using the hot water for health benefits.
Walking is described as a permanent part of the general well-being of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of the position and position.
Releasing the mobile phones, people talk together on personal notes about home and space or enjoy the similar power of the water: thinking and charging the batteries of the soul and body.
A Hundred Days in Elections
There are hundred days until the U.S. goes to the election and chooses a president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he is still on the steep run.
Joe Biden, the prospective candidate of the Democratic Party, has a large advantage of Trump nationally, being targeted by opinion surveys.
According to the AP news agency, the American population estimates that the nation is on the wrong path.
Trump’s reaction to the global coronavirus is also very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans believe that the president has held a bad deal with economics.
Only two out of ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.
32 percent claim to support Trump’s response due to the epidemic and 48 percent say he has held a good deal of economics.
In March, it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to FiveThirtyEight, Biden’s 49.9 percent follow nationally, and Trump’s 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to bring his attention from his performance towards Biden, pushing under so-called cultural disputes, and proclaiming policies that are going to reverse law and rule.
However, Biden’s contributions are a lot to keep the attention of Trump and consider high chances of winning if the election is actually about how Trump has been working over the past four years.
Trump’s opponents also seem to be going down to the Republican Party and fear that Democrats might even reach a majority of the U.S. Senate, which has so far been very successful.
Politico announced that the Republican Party would have its greatest success in decades.
The polls have proven particularly bad in the 2016 elections, and now it looks like this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare the residents of suburbs to follow them, including saying that if President Biden is President, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and push racial clashes.
Among other things, Trump has abolished a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House designed to increase the diversity of suburbs.
He then urged “homewife” suburbs of the United States to read an article by former New York Secretary-General, stating that Biden would destroy suburbs of the United States and undertook Trump.
“Biden will ruin your neighborhoods and your American dream.
“I’ll keep it, and even make it even better,” the president said.
The residents of the United States are an ever-increasing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since the re-election of George W. Bush in 2004, the candidate who has won the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group, but lost to Barack Obama.
Surveys have shown that despite Trump's secured a limited majority in the suburbs of 2016, his followers have been drastically contracted.
Although this is different between surveys, Biden has estimated a fifteen percent advantage over Trump in the outlets recently.

Will the Olympic fire be the light at the end of the walks?
After the final decision had been made to delay the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have made so far, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic Fire would be “the light at the end of the walks,” referring there probably to the world history of the crown virus that the world's population is now pursuing through a cohesive.
Reasons have a year more to prepare and Japan’s authorities are making up the cost of the delay.
Everyone has a lot of heads.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would become the venue of the Olympic Games this year, Japanese representatives’ celebrations were genuine.
They cried and laughed alternately, but Tokyo had sought to hold the games in 2016, but it lauded to a lower hold for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan would be in the attention of the world.
The games were to be held from 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed for a year, starting on 23 July 2021 and ending on 8 August.
If you do not manage to keep the plays, then if the crown virus is still too high, the plays will be stopped.
No one wants to think that way to the end.
The Olympic Games are not a regular sport.
There is nothing to save, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last game.
The election in the city for the Olympic Games is based on the opinion of the election committee on the presentations of the cities.
The more prominent the presentation —the more likely to get the lump.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars trying to hold the 2016 Olympics or over 20 billion kroner.
For the second time, when applying for the games in 2020, 75 million dollars, about ten billion dollars, were placed in the promotion.
In 2013, when Tokyo was decided to play this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent 30 billion kroner on the project.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean based on how much it costs to build an Olympic village, a stadium and in general to strengthen the country’s infrastructure to manage such tournaments, prepare it and keep the games themselves.
Japan's organizers have said that the Olympics in Tokyo, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from a government auditor in Japan, published at the end of last year, found that the cost was nearly double that number.
It is unlikely that the cost of postponing the games will not be adequately assessed, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
There are so high figures that all tax revenues in the Icelandic state only dwindled for about half the Olympic Games, compared to the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are the event of the magnitude that they have tended to become the coverage of economists, who try to crawl into numbers and view the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, a lot of people seem to have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympic Games are less than so positive for the economy of those who hold them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, the number of jobs is very high in the short term, but in the long term, cities tend to sit up with debt gaps and high operating costs of small-use structures.
Ride in Brazil has a significant debt for the 2016 Games and has been in trouble costing maintenance of all the major sports structures built for the plays.
It has been recorded since the 2012 London Games, but only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
This means that we weren’t talking about new jobs except in a small way.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in keeping the Olympic Games financially due to the striking costs associated with the structures built for the plays.
However, the benefits are often considered to be in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, although there is a lot of uncertainty about the games in 2021.
It is also unclear whether you will be able to take all the audiences that usually attend the plays.
The main issue, however, is the honour that the cities must be elected, but it is difficult to appreciate for money.
Despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy of the games is not the nature that it can be placed on the tickets.
But even if the show is great and there’s no savings, it’s not just about money.
It is the sports heroes that are in the foreground.
For some fans, it’s just a surprise to postpone the games.
For example, the Australian feminist and gold winner in his article on the Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, is casual and would have been away from good fun this summer, but hopes to be in a competition form for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to quit after the games this year, if they had been held at the right time, the temptation of the games in some cases means they quit a contest before the games take place.
Trust their bodies simply not to go through years in addition to strict exercises.
Few athletes took a look at the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 as well as the gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been interviewing in the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She's going to play in 2021, but she's not sure she'll still be on the top of the games next year, so she'll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered high age, it is higher for a gymnastics woman in the leading order.
“It’s a delicate issue,” Biles said, but smiles at another interview published on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page, asking whether she’s going to reach as long in the 2021 games as she did in Rio 2016.
“I don’t know if I’ll be on the top after a year,” Biles said.
She has previously mentioned that her body does not tolerate the stress that follows the gymnastics training for much longer.
She is still exercising for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop practicing suddenly when the World Cup stood at the highest and the gymnasium was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all the athletic structures were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
I think it’s a bit better than most people.
“We have a plan now.
It was hard to start practicing again after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we’re back and I’ll keep up with the exercises as soon as the year goes.
Of course, we don’t know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we’re still practicing because they’re going to be, can’t do anything else.
“I’ve been doing too much to leave the sport now,” Biles said.
It’s like a lot more doubting, or perhaps even more conscious that the game will not be held in 2021 either.
Predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know how the state of the World Cup will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do than to prepare for the Olympic Games, given that they will be held by year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid.
Suspended a Wedding Due to Psychiatry
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about accurat right now,” the actress said in a conversation with People.
“We want to get married sometime and have the dream wedding and have all the people we love.
But we decided to beat it on time and focus on what’s important now and it’s helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look at the world more than weddings these days.
There’s a lot going on and we’re going to focus on what’s going on in the world.”
