Politicians in Wales afraid of "like fools"
There was horror among certain members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
AMs from the whole political spectrum are concerned that the name change could give rise to ridicule.
A member of the Labour party said that his group was concerned because "it rhymes on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fools).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which currently puts together a bill on the introduction of the name changes, said: "The final decision on the names that Members of Parliament will receive, of course, is up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowered the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, with wide support to call the Assembly a Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members (Welsh MEPs) or WMPs, but the MWPs were given the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs seem to suggest alternative options, but the struggle to achieve agreement may prove difficult for the chairman of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform bill contains other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs get the final vote on what to call when the bill is debated.
Macedonian votes to change its name
The voters voted on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decade of long disputes with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim to Greece's territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says that he will subordinate to the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just a price paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's get quiet while the churches of Harlem fight
"The elderly people I've spoken to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there is none of the parts."
He said it is understandable that the bars disappear.
“People socialize in other ways nowadays,” he said.
"Children no longer constitute the neighborhood's living rooms, where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money gained from selling assets does not last long and that they "before or later are back where they started."
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of such people that do not help the neighborhood's recurring sanctuaries.
“The overwhelming majority of people buying apartments in these buildings are white,” he says, “and it breathes further to the development where these churches finally close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who headed a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parish children made plans to restore the building, they ordered the bell game.
The priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the watches of the poor."
The expert who played on the bell game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historic instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a substitute for him.
What has happened in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated narrative of architects and entrepreneurs, some of which have been captured by church leaders, others of the diocese.
In July, the council of the parish, the chief body of leading laymen, wrote to the diocese on concerns that the diocese "will try to push the expenses further" to the parish council, although the parish council had not been involved in hiring the architects and entrepreneurs that the diocese sent in.
Some of the congregation members complained of the lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on diving trip after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then along with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just enthusiastic to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All his collar legs were torn up," Hammel said, he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone should get out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flew to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported in critical condition.
It is unclear which species of sharks attacked.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said by a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to capture the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in style with department stores.
As part of a great effort to take in the UK beauty market, which has a value of 2.8 billion GBP and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products valley. The larger rows of beauty products are tested in 11 stores around the country and are launched in several stores next year if they turn out to be successful.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets are looking for new products for shelves that were previously used for television, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's says they double their selection of beauty products for 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in style with those you see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches the range of Boutique makeup, so the majority of products are suitable for vegans - something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop tests housing in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later in the year.
Online shopping and a development towards purchasing small amounts of food daily with local merchants means that supermarkets need to do more to make people visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores are going to look like department stores as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of groceries and have made the purchases more profitable.
The previous efforts of the supermarket to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with the Boots in the early 00s, but the cooperation ended with a dispute over how the earnings from the pharmacies in the supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a further range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We’ve changed the look and decor of our ranges of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the inclusive environment and practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way to shop.”
Peter Jones "rasing" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal to 11 million GBP
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "rasing" after television host Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal to 11 million GBP with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand.
This Morning Host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den-Star Peter Jones furious after she retires from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last moment — to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "rasing" when the popular television woman during a thrilled meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, meant that her new deals — with a value of up to 1.5 million GBP — meant she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of 11 million GBP.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she had to deal with in the next few decades.
Her decision to retire surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the headquarters of Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the announcement from This Morning host, which is among the UK’s highest earnings stars, can cost the company millions due to large investments in products — ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and housing products — and the potential for further delays in the launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and the householder Dan Baldwin has had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business action."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love."
He laughed at the criticism he would get from the news media to make a comment that "is not a president worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody on a news host.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a meeting more, after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diploma Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "similar reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial action on disarmament.
He noted that instead, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic viewpoint in the speech at his electoral meeting.
“North Korea is going well,” he said.
"There was a rise to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.”
He said his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim had created positive results — the end of rocket tests, help with the release of hostages and the return of earthly remains from U.S. militarymen.
And he defended his unusual approach in relation to Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this tight-packed arena, we’d have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroys island and kills hundreds
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboks population stood without home, the state of national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
“In many cases, it has unfortunately been clear that they do not request international assistance, so it is a little challenging,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children sets up a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster preparedness, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Due to the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami refuge sites have been built in Aceh, but they are not an ordinary view of other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but there seems to be a lack of tsunamisirs, and it has probably affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions it is challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's deficient infrastructure a central point in his campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by lack of funding in the context of the campaign next year.
Mr. Joko also experiences pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge is on Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind with 1-0.
He pricked to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot against the farthest pole.
The ball flew high across the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position to get the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I made a single touch. I didn't think so much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the half-leg, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker returned with his heel to Mateo Kovacic before moving up the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's halfway.
Kovacic made a quick one-to-one on the midfield.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished against the farthest pole with a shot with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Naples in the Champions League group game at 15 on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europe League at 15 Thursday in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster prepared early Sunday.
Many were reported trapped in the brickworks from buildings that fell after the earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the richter scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a spokesman at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with bricks from collapsed buildings.

I would also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that may be crucial for the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman are arriving on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police say they are informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but is told by the police that no one can get into the building.
He was stunned when he heard what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer was overheard saying to a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She continues to repeat, "It's so terrible."

Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the latest memorial hit by discussion about "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as " madness" and an "experience to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in connection with the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a target.
The image storm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s amazing imagination of Cromwell is a testimony of 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe it is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate imaging is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What lies certainly is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure that represents one side of the struggle.
His performance as Lord Protector is also worth commemorating and commemorating.”
Killer pigs assault and kill Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man identified only under his surname "Yuan" was found dead with an overrated artery and smashed in blood near a pig path on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pig injections with vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pork stairs next door was open.
He said there was a large snake in the pork scene with blood in the mouth.
A medical investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had bite the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin who goes under the surname "Wu," in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Records from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police collect evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and authorities from the market are negotiating compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rare units, but there have been previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg masted a Welsh farmer against his tractor, into his wife frightened the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playful.
The naps, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just need to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will give heavy rain with floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 38 m/s, a category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure excursion across the Pacific Ocean, moving eastwards towards the U.S. west coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins pushing tropical humidity to the north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure discharger coming closer, creating heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm floods, floating rainfall and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical humidity will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially across large parts of Arizona.
There is a high probability of storm floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It would be a very bad idea to move into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can transform gorges into bulging rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dust blow.</say>
The low-pressure outlet approaching will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of over 13 mm, which can cause smaller amounts of liquid rainfall and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their rainy season.
Spread tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be high temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes cooler, but there remains reasonably hot in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern regions.</seg>
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high likelihood of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million saw Thursday's gripping testimony from the nominee to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle with stations that interrupted the general programs to tell about Friday's late development continued: an agreement composed by Senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, which allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judgment Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in her drunken state was mocking her and trying to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he is 100% sure it didn’t happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million people saw it Friday.
The company recorded average viewer numbers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not instantly available viewing numbers from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a viewer figure that corresponds to a game during the NFL playoffs or the Oscars award.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-borne hosts have strongly backed up on the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day, Nielsen said.
The ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while protesters shouted at him when he tried to take a lift to the hearing in the judiciary committee.
He stood with a downward look for several minutes while he was scolded, and CNN sent live.
“I’m standing in front of you,” said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he wanted more to say at the hearing in the committee.
All the television stations covered live a few hours later, when the Judgment Committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would go on to a vote for the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he would vote only for the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee in the following week, which the Democrats, who are in the subscription of the Senate, had sought.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's elections influenced because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom accuses critics of "leg policy" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU for "playing politics" with the UK's future and undermine the national interests. It happened in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reported his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "all through ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect for the shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of manslaughter, police said in Baton Rouge.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the game.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on, reported the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After the interrogation of Simpson, police said he had confessed the shooting at Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot that went from head to neck.
Police Department said a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police lab, police from Southern University and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation leading to the arrest.
The athlete at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their “care and hunt for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said the team is "cracked" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
“That’s what you’re always afraid of,” Wade said.
Volcano spies ash over Mexico City
Ash, spied from the Popocatepetl volcano, has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater, and 183 gas and ash emissions were detected in 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumble and tremors over several laps.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on car routes in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the richter scale, shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police meet with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters wanting independence, encountered with unrest officers as thousands participated in rival demonstrations that marked the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on secretion.
A group of masked separatists held upset back, threw with and powder paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There was also fighting later in the day when the police used their staff to keep the fights down.
Throughout several hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven", and were met with unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The vote remains high in the independent region a year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the voters' accession was low, and those who were against the secession boycottated the vote in large fashion.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year, after police tried to halt the voting during violent clashes at voting venues throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dares to hope that Catalonia can gain independence.
“The last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry with joy to have had the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although they gained a narrow but important victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved in exile or sit in detention and await judgment for their role in the holding of the vote and subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on his phone in support of the police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
“There will be more and more excitement,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting his trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“The position of candidate in European elections is the best approach to disregarding the backlash of democratic values and the suppression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
There may also have been an armbrush on the car at some point.
Shooting from Menga gives Livingston victory at 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston overwhelmed Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won at the league outdoors this season and will meet the leading team Hearts, which they are located eight points after, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will be visiting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, in return, expands their unbeaten strip to six games, and chief coach Holt has still not suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances against cash outage
Holt's team should have been ahead of a long time before they scored, and their direct playing style caused big problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across in front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the goal after he glanced in to hit Craig Halkett's transverse header in front of the goal.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the outdoor team problems in death ball situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
The Rangers made a free kick, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created together the plan to Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually not challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was averted with the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's deathball situations.
Continuous deliveries came into Livingston’s field, but were deterred, and two demands for a penalty kick — after Halkett’s tackling on the replacement Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball — were rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal efforts and strong results for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastic and exceeded the expectations of their upward journey.
Their style of play and squad is largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but much of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he stepped up.
There were many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the game.
Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played under level.
Their ends lacked sharpness - only once they got the home team - and it's a steep awakening for the Rangers, located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There was smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Disputes have arisen in areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police held for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 from assembling in front of the mosque, but lots of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents - many of them Kurdish - also took note of and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept in the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero of some German Turks and mocked as an autocrats of others.
Accidents on the way in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crashes
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled from the scene, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Roadblocks are set up, bus routes are rebuilt, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured during unrest
Six prison officers have been injured under concerns in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
Concerns arose in the prison HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 9.30 BST on Sunday, and the troubles are still underway.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the riots involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for smaller facial injuries on site.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel are in place to deal with the ongoing unrests in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clarified that the responsible are being reported to the police and may end up spending longer behind the trembling.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, unrest officers were called to prison to deal with serious unrest, where employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm floods (major areas can benefit)
It is rare for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but it most likely happens at the beginning of next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the southwestern United States and create a risk of storm floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings on storm floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had preserved the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center anticipate 51 to 102 mm rain with isolated quantities up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin will likely get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those without risk of storm flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to U.S. drought surveillance, over 40 percent of Arizona are experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category,” reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves to the north by 19 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore falls into strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can become severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rain in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the US Southwest Desert Area," the National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storm floods and floating downfalls in deserts as well as landslides in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two-18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
Employees have called on anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was underneath the Democratic Party’s “evil and anger.”
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's ruthless and monstrous tactics," Trump said at a polling meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been exposed to "the evil, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a testimony before Congress Thursday and strongly denied and emotionally accused Christine Blasey Ford that he committed sexually to her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a testimony at the hearing of his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the best legal brains of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service,” he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republicans appearing in the voting places at mid-term elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important choices lies in our lifetime.
You can’t vote for me, but you actually vote for me,” he said.
“That’s why I’m traveling around and fighting for amazing candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to “strip against and block.”
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person high in the Republican Party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, death toll growing
At least 384 were killed, and many of them washed away by giant waves that hit the beach when a large earthquake and a large tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at foam time, sucked many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake that measured 7.5 on the richter scale.
"When the tsunami rush occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach activities. They did not run immediately and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, the dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea by 800 km/h before the hit the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published air photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and intertwined bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftermaths continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian board of directors for the assessment and use of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy triggered during Friday's great earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, the board said.
Nugroho described the injuries as "inclusive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had crashed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found clamped under the bricks from crashed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the area of Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are over 300,000 people here,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” they said.
The board was criticized from many fronts on Saturday for not stating that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had come within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur recordings shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings about the tsuami coming closer to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes a wall of water strikes the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cuts off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but there is still a hard need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city’s airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll after Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
The staff of the World Vision from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees are looking for shelter under presents set up in the courtyard at their account. They came past areas with extensive destruction on the road, said Doseba.
"They told me that so many destroyed houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organisations began the harsh work of resetting the aid work, complained that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad must only enter if the area where the accident has occurred is declared national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster,’ we can open up for international assistance, but there’s no status yet.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family held to the missing people in the hope that their closest would be the miracles that brighten the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under bricks for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian Paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders to the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
“As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how he, in the hours, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, desperately had sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were attending the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted only in one gray flybone instead of two blue.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stole $26,750 from a Brink's assassin who was about to meet a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The car's driver had emptied the cash machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money," police officer Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran at the back of Brink's staff and stole a bag money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves please contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed its name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "The Beings formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place before his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, as cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the show's creator.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also shifted between lower and lower case letters and changed whether the hyphen is included.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military power against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to never use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th year of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration at the site on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when leftist student movements clashed in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening several free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The United States Should Double the Financing of Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come, after various parts of the U.S. government have issued statements about artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced its plan last year and aims to take first place in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next major breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances that the next major performance in artificial intelligence is achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that struck the highest ranked American Othello player, and later became the head of Microsoft Research and CEO of Google's department in China.
Lee recognized former technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition will come to be identified, so that the next visionaries can be identified.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to obtain legislatures from the government,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that catches the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think PhDs in Artificial Intelligence should automatically have offered work permits.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations’ distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint centre for artificial intelligence, which will involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over USD 100 million per year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, U.S. legislation trying to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has remained silent for several months.
Macedonian votes to change its name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia, a measure that would solve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country to the north constitutes a claim to Greek territory, and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has sought entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the voters will make up the 50% required to make the vote valid.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you for NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the country's future, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU umbrella because it means more safe life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the voting results and make it valid.
The name change would require a majority in Parliament of two-thirds.
The State Electoral Commission said that at 13 no irregularities had been reported.
However, the vote was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent at the latest parliamentary election in 2016, with 66 per cent of the registered voters voting.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the vote in Macedonia for a change of the country's name, which would open up membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who want to boycott the vote.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to achieve membership with raised forehead, not on the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us like Macedonia, we can turn against others like China and Russia and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would provide a highly-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I think a large majority will vote for because more than 80 percent of our citizens advocate the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "insurance of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote - fewer than the required vote participation.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the proven government since it entered in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights throughout the Brighton Defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring that came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a delivery on the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before he hung out on an open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought himself past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to overlist Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing around 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate advance in the Premier League game.
That goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero, in that sequence, received the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling towards the farthest pole.
The Sky Blues forward pricked the ball in the net just before it glanced past the goal.
City fights Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to drill Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn’t have much to fight for.
However, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to occupy the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the possibility of participating in playoffs for the Rockies, who have played a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least held a wild-card spot with a 5-2 victory over National's Friday night, but still has their first division title for good.
“Although we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game well knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the public here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the probably highest level I’m going to face this year.
Why shouldn’t I be excited to play under those conditions?”
Nationals have not yet announced the starting lineup for Sunday, but will likely put Scherzer in as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his pitches Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right hand player from Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds voter meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation of his elections to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans appearing at the voting venues at the mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big - you can't vote on me, but you actually vote on me. That's why I'm travelling around and fighting for amazing candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats you can see that happens right now.
And they are determined to get power back with all the means available. You can see how evil they are.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control. That’s what they want, power and control, but we won’t give them it.”
The Democrats, he said, have as a mission "stripped against and blocked".
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrought and evil and disgusting and false."
He referred to the supreme Democratic Senator in the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which triggered the loud buh from the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, uh, what.
No, no, wait, it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a vast party.
They are intolerant to those who express their attitudes.
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a large number of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome - only because we have given our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong distance from anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship act went on to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically, similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders in.
In the call for the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For the majority of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, meetings on Friday night have just been like this.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not so, and the promise of "friendly, gentle" politics is far back in the past if it ever got started.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed by whether the party's leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader when colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared political stances began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I otherwise would never have agreed - whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public — and it really doesn’t matter what I say — I follow a long series of rough messages on social media calling for the abstention and contradiction of the middle-seeking policy and telling me that I shouldn’t be a member of Labour.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the desire to fight with the colleagues who are overcrowded with sexism or racism every day, but are still struggling.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in fact, it is no longer a spacious organization and with each vote of confidence or change selection rules the party becomes narrower.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years that if I'm putting a lid on myself and not so loud, I'm going to "nothing to do."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago, when I attended school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a declining state, and I set myself to create better public services for those who need it most - whether it has been as a council member or minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policy, nor during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who made the resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country rushes towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of Labour.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no kind of threat of opt-out or political fitness will stop me from acting out of what I think is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr becomes top team
Two late scorings may have got the final result to draw a not entirely truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazing entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now on the top of the scoreboard and are the only unbeaten team of ten.
Ultimately, it was as much their superior defense as their better utilization of the chance that bore the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
“Our battles have been demanding so far, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's scoring after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded to the game of Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a scoring that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo developed Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the half-leg. He scored and then got a soloscoring, so it stood 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out of the field on the stretcher. When the game was resumed, Ayr developed the precedence with a scoring from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Acting Ayr leader Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose exploited their extra man with a scoring from Bruce Colvine without follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the emerging Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick within the posts and followed up with a more nearly immediately after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent wing player Gregor Henry off to the homefield's fifth scoring.
Still Game star looking for new career in the restoration industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restoration industry after it emerged that he has occupied the directorship of an authorized restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars in along with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": Inland State of Bolivia hopes that court will reopen route to the Pacific Ocean
Seamen patrol around the naval headquarters, enclosed in rigs, in La Paz.
In public buildings, a sea-blue flag has been lifted.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
In the entire inland state of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still strong, and the same is the desire to sail the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their highest for several decades, while Bolivia awaits a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
“Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course awaits with a positive look at the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision by the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country and hope that the Court of Justice in The Hague will give Bolivia support that Chile, after decades of discussions, is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who faces a controversial campaign next year, also has a lot at stake in the ruling on Monday.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia's party - and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, has no power to overhaul Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the International Court of Justice dismisses judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given a backlash.
"The case of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' warrior rhetoric has eliminated the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was abnormally rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreement and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific,” he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless they can rely on the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never destroy their nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with promises given during a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments were given after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently faces a reboot of the locked nuclear diplomaty over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a “want dream” that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to the knees.
Washington is reluctant to the declaration, as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism as to whether Pyongyang is serious in terms of abolishing an arsenal, which the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections of large headwear that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk blurred for a collection of extra large headwear as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated on Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressed work by Valentino was a lavish with a feather-like broad shade that covered the heads of the models.
There were also other extra big accessories including watermelons with jewels and even ananas - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had joined lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving stuff with snorkel and mask, and others resembled a melted vaffelis.
And if you continue the big fashionstatements, you are lucky.
Style scouts anticipate that the huge hats could get to shops near you.
The giant hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60-inch-wide shade that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark, which is behind the highly impractical hat that was spread across social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk - a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the model that shows it.
The orange basta box with bast freezers and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in regular stores next summer. The designer has had so much influence that it becomes hard to ignore the demand for giant-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic results behind them, and it continues in 2018 with another number of outstanding exam results, which are also strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can compile and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we experience that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, it hits the heart.”
It is an important reminder that we can not only stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest exam results this year that languages are the highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS' 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received the grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now perceived as subject choices at the same level as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' pensa and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills conducted in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers were unable to occupy vacancies, 17% had to do with lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will in the future require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career the young people choose, they have, if they have learned a different language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this one.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically give a multilingual person a lead to competitors.
According to a YouGov poll with over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
Speaking more languages, especially languages from developing countries, gives children a better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland there is a difference between which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be the most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to delivering a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills required to succeed, whatever the future offers.
At present it cannot be denied that language continues to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and it must be reflected in the education.
Modern languages should actually be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this award to Scotland's youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James plays in Sunday's opening game before the season starts against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It’s not yet clear how many minutes he plays.
“It will be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won’t play the whole game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' scheduled six games before the start of the season.
“Where I am in my career, I don’t need games before the start of the season to get ready,” he said.
Trump's Election Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of elections tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first out of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote for confirmation of Trump's appointed judge to the vacant seat at the Supreme Court is put to rest, Trump tries to create support for the upcoming mid-term elections, because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are made in November.
When is Trump’s voter meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting at Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at midnight (Danish time) the night between Saturday, November 29 and Sunday, November 30, 2018.
You can watch Trump's polling meeting in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings about Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense due to accusations of sexually infringing behavior, and the expected vote in the Senate for confirmation has been put down for a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the primary objective of this strip of election meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
“People from President Trump’s campaign team said the five election meetings next week aim to “create energy among volunteers and supporters when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Control over Congress is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, now that we enter the busy campaign time,” a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, told Reuters.
This evening's election meeting is held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh," West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to plunge up to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, who deals with political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team U.S. has proven fighter and tries to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's single duels
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday's four-man dueller was perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating momentum pendul is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in - not least in competitions like this one.
So where would they say there is momentum now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so we'll probably see it a bit like momentum," said Jordan Spieth, before he held the night.
Europe, of course, has the advantage. They are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 points more to play about.
As Spieth says, however, Americans feel that they have little wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The high shouts of jubilee grew higher as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important put, which secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two beats behind after two duels.
His cushion, which secured them the game on hole 15 was met with a similar scream - the kind of scream that shows that he doesn't think the American team is out of the competition yet.
“You just need to find the inner strength and focus on your own battle,” Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the biggest story from the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but sympathetic couples have scored four points in four games and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy apparently flows on both to and from the wild audience, shows that it is the most difficult to beat Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is caught by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
All in all, synchronously on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning in the four-man duels when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
On Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The matches with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look at close teams due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy lightning can change rapidly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duals have also shown that Team USA has the fighter that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of last day in the Ryder Cup
Europe has a huge advantage before the last day at the Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the United States of America at 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and have so far scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over an unprecedented American team in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States made more resistance in foursomes. They won four games, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches, if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to have won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have been nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the only second couple in Ryder Cup history to have won four points in their first four games.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a discouraged Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games on Saturday, had little brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning's fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and won a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, which is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it as they want it, on a lightly windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being behind with four points before the singles matches. Since Furyks currently has the trophy, however, they only have to achieve a draw to keep it.
After being second-best for two days, however, it seems that they can't master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will not unilaterally defeat if there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions reinforce their distrust to the United States and that the country will not abandon their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the world-wide organization’s general assembly that North Korea had shown “significant goodwill” over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling an area for nuclear testing and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no chance that we will take our first steps and unilaterally deploy.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase-shaped" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important, as it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as otherwise has previously been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint announcement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "atom armor on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to softening up harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by coercion and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The understanding that sanctions can bring us to the knees is a wish dream among people who do not know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a summit again between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The Minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the nuclear disarmament was to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked."
Nonetheless, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea's missiles against the U.S. mainland was inevitable, after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened the United Nations with “total destruction” of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for exercising courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that sanctions have to remain until North Korea is devastated.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a schedule for these actions, but said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met with Ri at the sideline of the United Nations General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea only a few hours later accused him of asking "walking-like demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant and a nuclear complex if the United States took "similar steps."
He said Kim had told him that the “similar steps” he demanded were the security promises that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements towards a normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take the course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where you study all night sustained by large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that students at the world’s best university often don’t know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which, he thinks, is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after holding a presentation on the effects of sleep deficiency on learning.
“When the show was finished, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why do I first know this now when I’m on the candidate?’
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains students how good sleep habits can improve one’s academic and sporting performance as well as one’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the University’s health field, said the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that students were in serious sleep shortage during the week.
The hour-long course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a college room where students must click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to gain knowledge about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one’s sporting performance is affected by sleep deficiency, and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how long-term sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
“We know that this will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we think they have the right to know it - just as one has the right to know how cigarettes affect the health,” Professor Czeisler added.
The pride that is in taking an "allnighter" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on the students has led to sleep shortage being a growing problem.
The “secret weapon” against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep, he said — it even counteracts weight gain because sleep deficiency makes the brain think that one is starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped last year Professor Czeisler organize the course when he took one of his courses at his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and caused him to work on making it a general course at the entire university.
He hopes that the next will be that all graduates are offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set an alarm so they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens that can move at the 24-hour rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menga lower Gerrard and co.
The Rangers suffered another defeat on the outfield, as Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's uncontinuous team had to take thanks with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was looking for their first outfield victory since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard only the second defeat in 18 games as a coach. Thus there are eight points up to Hearts in the first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond to.
Rangers are now backing down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third place after Hibernian with only the goal score.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, as line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head of a thrown object, which seemed to come from the outfield section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that reached the Betfed Cup semifinal by tons past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, put the same 11, who shaved a point of Hearts' lead last week, and he would have been excited to see his sharp team exhausting the opponents all over the field.
Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes inside the game when Menga's first-time delivery sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempts ran over.
A free kick in depth from Keaghan Jacobs found his way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow kicked past the back post.
Rangers, however, took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was at least unhappy when Judge Steven Thomson undertook the Columbian's appeals for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless broke up after a quarter of a game.
Rangers managed only two shots in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's headstroke and Ovie Ejaria's tame shots.
Although Livis's opening in the 34th minute was something random, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers could not handle a deathball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it in the goal.
During the break, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave a pot when the wingman sent the ball to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the outfit to play on their premises with many long balls up the field from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the last part of the game, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the goal.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late penalty kick after being dried up with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: Inventor of the geigert counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": on September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today — if we TELL... — was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that in the long term would lead to the apparatus known as the geigert counter.
The Geigert counter has become a solid component of both science and popular culture, as could be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as bondish scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a geigert counter that is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals makes."
Evans: “Wait up, now it’s on!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that carries his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists in extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein common to many cancers and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists in extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so they can "see" the protein named HER2, as many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "gets several cancers to develop", including breast, ovarian, lung and intestinal cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach in which to take immune cells out of patients and "learn" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West held Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hatred after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well
After a coherent appearance in the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was bowed off as he commended US President Donald Trump, saying he himself would run for president in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the night Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again casket, he began on a dunder speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
“I talk so often to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s racist?’
But if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from the United States long ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in Senate court committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the recordings were not shown, comedian Chris Rock West uploaded the tirade on social media.
It is uncertain whether Rock tried to exhibit West by posting the recordings.
West also complained to the public about poor treatment backstage due to his headwear.
“They mobbed me backstage.
They said, 'Don't wear that hat.'
They mobbed me!
And they said I had sunk deep,” he said.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deep I'm sunk?" and said that he would wear his Superman coat because it means "you can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try with love.”
The audience buhed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff appeared to be embarrassed, Variety states with a comment from a person present: "There was toll in the study."
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then-girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU NOT TO LAD YOU CUE OF THE PUBL."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "as he is, and that's all right."
“But I don’t choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes, or supporting his “art”), who embraces and produces an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
“It’s too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he has taken a name change to the "entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, thus following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has named Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

The defendant is expected to be tried by the Belfast Under Court on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs for the stereotypical macho hero and says that such television characters mean that young men often feel they need to be hard to be respected.
Kit stated to Sunday Times Culture that he believes that there is "something wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies to him "very mindful".
“At the moment it’s a lot of my mind — where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?” he said.
“If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have learned young men in their upbringing?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He said, “What is congenital, and what is taught?
What do young men learn from television and on the streets that make them feel like they should be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
“It’s obvious that something has gone wrong with the young men.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not make successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit plays in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best of the whole Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's land property in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820.000 people in the country have been affected, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way has been reduced to something near zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
In 1997 homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is allegedly a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry before or later with women because of the country’s conservative values.
Many infectious cases are due to the lack of contraception in these conditions.
China’s government has since 2003 promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
A member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied in Saturday's accusations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the allegations originated from websites and supporters from the "most right-wing".
“The lies, lies, and more terrible lies,” Waters wrote in a tweet.
The published information reportedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers on US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill. This happened during a hearing in the Senate dealing with accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie,” Waters continued.
“Membered by my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a direct lie.”
Waters' statement quickly received criticism online, among other things from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that she doesn't have the right temper to be a member of Congress.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, don't get angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to preserve the peace of mind.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' place in the mid-term election, also gave his opinion to know on Twitter.
"Great, if it's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official announcement, she says her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the rule of law regarding these fraudulent claims."
“We want to make sure the perpetrators are found,” she continued, “and that they will be held legally responsible for their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my staff.”
Johnny English's review hits again - underwhelming spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British ice sheet, and it also seems relevant for the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will, sarcastic self-satisfaction, be the country's new export option?
At least, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes has been allowed to make roars renewed again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic inventory aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is of course the thundered secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife-headed Mr. Bean, and a proper clue of him who accomplished a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international lusk pants that left chaos in his cool water after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television advertisements.
There are some good moments in this recent shot on the strain from JE.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers clinged against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson’s talent for physical comic, but humor feels quite superfluous and strangely superfluous, especially now that more “serious” film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comic as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie weddings in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinite starting point for the film is that the UK is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England’s top secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field of horror for the responsible agent — a unfortunately very small role to Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and combat-ready Prime Minister who already suffers a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been revealed, she is forced to cancel someone's retirement.
And of course, it is the clumsy Johnny English, who is now a school inspector at a upper-class school, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for some sort of School of Rock training in spying.
English rushes back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunites with his hard-tested former right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an overenthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain - a role that Vicki Pepperdine was wasted on.
Thus, the Royal Intelligence Service is completely immature Batman and Robin back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is stumbling close to being inspired by charismatic and scary tech-billionaire Jason Volta — played by Jake Lacy — who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their furious risky escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to a magnificent French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with Volta's house.
All the guns are fired in the film's final sequence, but no matter how well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of children's television over it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I could not avoid thinking about the other Johnny English films: Can the English film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to deal with plan for four-day work week with unchanged salary to the British
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can be satisfied with a four-day work week, but get pay for five.
The party will allegedly have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra holiday.
This would mean that the employees would have three days of weekend without falling into pay.
Sources say that the idea would be consistent with the party’s economic goal of pulling the country in a more favorable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from an economy in change.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: “A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year.”
"It's not going to happen in one day, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits with the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the party's overall strategy for the industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the goal is not supported by unanimous support in the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said, "A four-day work week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to rip power back from "anonymous directors" and "exploitors" in supply companies.
The shadow finance minister’s plans also sow doubts as to whether the current shareholders in water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour could “contradict” them on the basis of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to get workers in corporate boards and to create including ownership funds, which will allocate 10 percent of private companies’ share value to employees who stand to receive up to £500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes about the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation over accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week. And it raises the question of whether the FBI fund could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something forward that could make them change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed more open to the idea than his South Carolina colleague.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened — after the accusations came out — and said, “Did you do it?”
He was stainless, determined and unambiguous."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to be chiselled in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of them she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can’t see that this has to change anything.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York is the host city of the Global Citizens Festival - an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world's poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will for the seventh time receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s big lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will bring attention to the real goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that struggles to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or any other meaningful action that can bring attention to the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Creating the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" — i.e., people feel like they make a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a Twitter post?
Global Citizen reported that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from their members aimed at different goals.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding goals and policy measures that correspond to more than $37 billion, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions that had become due to their actions, which ran up to over $10 billion, which had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, which has been started in England and is a collaboration between investors and trade strong individuals. They strive to "help children to survive their full potential" and promise $35 million to remedy nutritional problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," Tracey Ullman ambassador to the audience said in April 2018.
The group also said that the government of England has now promised funds to improve the nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In response to one of the website’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen wrote: “It will be a long and hard battle, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But just as with the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year’s festival in New York.
The U.S. may use its fleet to "block" for Russian energy exports, the U.S. Interior Minister says
"If necessary," Washington may use his fleet to prevent Russian energy from coming on the market, even in the Middle East, reveals U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially where they operate on the invitation of the judicial government, is a pretext for expanding the sales of their energy.
“I think they’re in the Middle East because they want to sell energy just like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
“The United States has with our fleet the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the seaways, and if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not come on the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting, such as the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that considers itself to be the voice of the American energy consumer.
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are basically the same.
“The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are all about utilizing and replacing fuel,” he said while referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony,” whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, spokesmen of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the “capture of Moscow.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 line, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is merely due to financial considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exercising pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose supplier," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry, in September.
The position of Americans is met with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to intervene outside the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party mixing into our energy supplies," said the leader of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren “considers strongly” to run for the 2020 presidential election,” Massachusetts Senator said.
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to run for the presidential election after the midterm elections, she said on Saturday.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front,” she said.
"After 6 November, I will consider considering running for the presidential election."
Warren gave his opinion about President Donald Trump to the city council and said he “leads the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing about our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been pronounced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course, the FBI must investigate the matter before the vote."
However, a poll from Thursday shows that the majority of Warren’s own backland does not believe that she should run for 2020.
According to a poll from the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not set up.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% for and 48% against a possible lineup.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential elections count among others former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he announced his final decision in January.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at a voter meeting for Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after signing up to the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is undergoing, after he has returned home, makes me able to relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are returning home with," she told the public to a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in space" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and have become harder. They go and think if there is respect for it, their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, to prevent the notification of domestic violence and to be in possession of a weapon in drunken state, says Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the police in Wasillas.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law refusing asylum to victims fleeing fraud or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered on Friday in Washington a partially independent statement in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, according to NBC News.
The applicant's full name in the Grace vs. Sessions trial, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers originate, as countries with far-reaching problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum legislation reversed a decision made by the U.S. Foreign Affairs Council in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia's Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new law "looks away from decades of state, federal and international law."
“The federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against that principle,” the statement said.
The lawyers argued in the statement also that the law of rejection of immigrants harms the American economy, as there is a higher probability that they become independent and "deliver the necessary labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions deprived Immigration Judges of the right to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asyl is offered to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political standpoint,” Sessions said in his announcement of the law on June 11.
It has never been intended that asylum should remedy all problems — or just all serious problems — that people around the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate
For survivors, the situation just got worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while comforting her little fever-stricken boy at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with a body.
We need clean water.”
The residents now returned to their broken homes to sort in soft possessions and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also hit by the 7.5 earthquake, could not follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
He had tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shaken the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was mast up against a destroyed wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going for a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife shouting for help, but then there was still silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of unfine methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in an American newspaper that struck drums for the benefits of an American-Chinese collaboration, the U.S. ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
The U.S. President, Donald Trump, referred on Wednesday to China Daily's paid indentation in Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional elections. China rejects the accusation.
US officials say to Reuters that Trump’s accusation of Chinese involvement in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, where they have put customs on each other’s import goods.
China's retaliation duty in the trade war was to hit exporters in states like Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, says Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, former Governor of China for a number of years in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said Beijing has injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China "trapps the use of the unfine methods of running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government utilizes the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, you will find only a few disagreements. And you will not get a fair picture of the Chinese people’s different attitudes towards China’s worrying economic direction, as the media are under tight control from the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which one.
Republicans alienate women before mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, warns analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the upcoming mid-term election, especially from women.
The case has put the emotions in the boil, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be done," Grant Reher, Professor of Political Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubts that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona) request for an FBI investigation in the 11th hour will soften anger voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they don't forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters cried during a demonstration in the Senate: "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the court committee chose to move on with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“The democratic enthusiasm and motivation are coming to a new height,” independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
“People say it has already reached a high level; that’s true.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters — 18-29-year-olds — who rarely vote, despite not liking the president.”
Even before Ford's public accusations of the sexual assault of the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had pointed out that it could give a backlash if the Republicans continued with the nomination.
“It has become a worse mess for the Republicans,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is being held accountable; it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," points Guy Cecil, President of the Priorities USA - a group that supports Democrats from being elected - to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared opinions on who to believe in after the testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41% of respondents certainly or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh either presumably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the accusations presented by Ford and at least another one, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford said last week under an oath to the Senate Judiciary that Kavanaugh took full action on her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her sex parts to her for a party when they both studied at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology doctor’s latest project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology so that people can create their own “personal online data collection” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt is, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, to gather resources, processes and abilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contract and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the available tools on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don’t talk to “Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely, so all their business models suddenly become redundant.”
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
Berners-Lee said on Saturday that Inrupt’s mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet that is being built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Ecclesiastical Receiver of the Victoria Cross of World War I
The only priest to win the Victoria Cross during World War I is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the order on 29 September 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-saving achievement.
According to London Gazette, colonel Lieutenant Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very thick fog and under fierce shooting from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led with the "greatest man's courage" his people before he alone attacked an artillery and unharmed three guns.
Lieutenant Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann at 72 said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he “feeled very honoured to participate in the parade” and added that “the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism.”
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine that you’ve stayed up all night to see the star-packed Bellator 206 and then will be denied to see the main event.
There were 13 matches on the show from San Jose, including six matches on the main show, and they were shown overnight in England on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the viewers in England were surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had kept awake until early morning for this particular battle.
A fan on Twitter described the shift to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
“According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 o’clock in the morning, why they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior service president, when asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work to include English viewers in planning in the future.
“When thinking about the re-release, I think we can make it work,” Coker said.
"But the clock is six Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the matter.
Believe me when it was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was actually the legislation.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We are happy with five games instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had “minder value” over sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less worthwhile than anyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he didn’t realize until he came into the larger classes that “all aren’t like me.”
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said he went less up to win the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host on the radio program, which has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken off a few months due to illness.
Daley was a guest in the Laverne's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his upbringing because "it wasn't socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said: “Today, the feelings of feeling memorable and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a highly profiled LGBT fighter and used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The triple world champion said he had been "surprised" when he fell in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it’s hard to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when going through so much at such a young age — he went to his first Olympic Games at age 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed."
“If you had asked me last year, it would all be if I had to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as a 40-year-old after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he should die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had received tickets to London in 2012 — when he would sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there for that time.
“I held his hand when his breath stopped, and it first came to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song choice, Proud of Heather Small, which had meant a lot during the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Uskarp Mickelson on the bench of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the shape if it doesn’t have to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets a record for the 12th time in the competition, which is held every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the centre of the events for the United States as usual, the five-fold big winner had to act and practice his game in the hope of correcting the faces.
Even not at the career's peak, he had the most straight drive, so the 48-year-old isn't a perfect match for the field at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes lost shots.
And if the field was not a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will meet the always precise winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, starting the 12 singles matches, start strongly, Mickelson's match can be crucial.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a pinch on my back, laid my arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a great faith in himself.”
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before - and also this week.
I guess I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought he was going to play more, but that’s how it went, and that’s how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson beat Nick Faldo's record for the most played matches in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been able to fully match his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said that his presence contributes to something undefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the teamroom," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes more than just the game.”
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Cup's single-up can quickly become nerve-piring.
The Daner debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a forehead of five points over the Americans, but was just about to be acquitted before the finish line with a victory of 111-31-2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just exactly won,” says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it is not over.
It's gonna have a full garbage tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it’s trying to win the trophy, and that’s where our focus lies.
“I’ve always said I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other side — the best golfers in the world.”
“I’m pleased with his players’ performances on a difficult track,” Bjorn added, “I don’t take anything of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow it’s the individual performance that counts, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested on every parameter as a golfer.
That’s what the players need to understand — get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, for he must also bring out the best in himself."
It looks different to opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced coturns on last day. First on the winning team in Brookline before he lost when Europe made the "Miraclet of Medinah".
“I remember every single word,” he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a great pressure on the intermediate battles.
We put our team together in relation to it and put the players on the field in the order we feel for. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the backlash and face Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it’s ensuring us all the way through,” Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship is launched again
The newest fregat of the German fleet should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. But the Germans must wait at least a year yet due to technical problems and an escalating price.
The insertion of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", is postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a spokesman from the military.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but compliance problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, will replace the ageing fregatter of the Bremen class.
They know that they want a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature for the latest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships — which allegedly will make Germany appear as an overseas power factor — will already be obsolete when they are deposited,” Die Zeit wrote.
The failed F125-fregat created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a series of crucial "software and hardware errors", which made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors - that's only half of that crew from the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limited the fleet's possibility of future updates.
The 7,000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, which includes the training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached dizzying €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregats become even more important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government's defense committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running out of deployment ready ships."
The official said the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust snigs to the secret life of bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands attempts to reveal how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by Scotland's National Trust scientists following ordinary bats, dwarf bats, long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Data is also collected by NTS and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bat calls and show what species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat is made.
Nature conservation adviser for NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has fallen drastically over the past 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the nests and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger. The same can flu traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
Flag mice are not blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echo localization technique to find insects and fly beyond obstacles.
NTS, responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes do rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s bat species.
David Thompson said it was an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There's a lot you don't know about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and children, thus risking extinction of a whole local population.
Flag mice are protected, and it is illegal to kill, bother or disrupt them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Project Manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bat, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations evolve."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him for "fake news" and says people will "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he has paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
“What they said today is fake news,” the five-fold winner of Ballon d’Or told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the charges they have called "an unforgivable disclosure of suspicions of the privacy sphere."
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event was reportedly held in June 2009 at a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal according to the submitted report in the Clark County City Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" caught by "one percent".
The case papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "banged for retaliation" and worried about being "publicly shattered".
The 34-year-old now says she will reverse the agreement, as she is still deeply influenced by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the incident was supposed to have taken place, and switched this summer to the Italian big club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: Britain “will forever regret” to lose car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever," if it lost its status as a leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would slow production temporarily at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that longer waiting at the border in the event of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% of them exported to the rest of the EU.
“As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK is leaving the EU at the end of March,” said the CEO of Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without a cross-border trade agreement.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturers has to do with the risks of the supply chain in the event of an exit without agreement.
Toyota’s production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems at the border could arise, which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "combined so that these checks are precisely avoided at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best deal, which not only allows us - as I call it - to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we have to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the factory's competitiveness, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a community trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they won’t come back.”
A government spokesman said, “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House said.
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may “be postponed a week more” as the showdown around Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special accuser Robert Mueller over his shoulder during his investigation of Russian election interference, relations between Trump's helpers and Russia and the president's possible obstacle to the course of court.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thus risk Mueller’s independence, has been a gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumour went on that he would quit.
Instead, a meeting was agreed on Thursday with Trump, who was at the time at the UN headquarters in New York City.
Trump said he would "preferred not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a collapse with the Senate court hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
Last Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "No date has been set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date.”
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not because of TV journalists’ games for the gallery, but added: "I don't disagree that they play up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
“The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him,” she said, adding without quoting a source: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
Press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to give rich opportunity to do so, and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it's going to stand in the press conference's place when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press conferences with high-ranking guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Health minister contacts EU employees in the Scottish health care system after Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than half a year before Britain resigned from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to pay for the applications for permanent stays for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, and decisions appear to be expected to be made in the autumn.
But the British government has also increased its preparation for any Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts each employee has done, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve the health care work for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we would very much like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie gets emergency surgery after head injury
The lineback from the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after having suffered a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, says Tennessees Mike Organ.
First coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell around out there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him in for further investigation.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie’s operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no "no details about the type or extent of the injury yet", and Tennessee State tries to find out when he suffered the injury.
Abercrombie is studying in the second year and is underway with his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 tackles gathered this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp fees when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK. The extra money must, according to the Conservative Party, help the homeless.
This move must mitigate Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will hit those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to make £120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today suggest that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The draw will be considered an attempt to match Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper homes and going after them with the highest income.
The increase in stamp duty will affect people and companies who do not pay tax in the UK. The earnings from here must be used for the government's struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added above the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases to rent, can reach up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are bought by people living abroad, making prices rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot inside the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spoken cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new bill comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping the property prices up by buying grounds they didn’t use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap homes to solve Britain’s “disgraceful housing situation.”
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching range of housing reforms, including checks on rent prices and deprived of the landlord’s ability to put people on the street if they comply with the rental contract.
He will also strengthen the ability to build public housing buildings.
May said, "The last year I said that I would use my Presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as well as for hard-working British.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the inworthiness of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says his "ultimative goal" is at some point becoming Scotland's coach.
Shooting at 42 enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East club, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He switched to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up seeing Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always pulled in me.
However, that option would only arise if I succeed in training clubs.”
Ross' predecessor as coach for Sunderland is Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic said he had no concerns about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success based on whether 'I can get this club back in the Premier League'.
From the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I’ll only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross is only three years in his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart’s coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa come back after being moved down in the third-best row and transformed St Mirren from downhill to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real divisor," he remembers about the time in Alloa.
“I honestly thought that the coaching work was right for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did well, served sensibly and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are many things you need to do on a weekly basis.
There is still such stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to exercise, and now I do. I haven't had it more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."
You can hear the entire interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 BST.

The heat wave this summer has increased earnings for England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales on pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants have declined 4.8%, show figures.
Peter Martin, a company consultant at CGA and has collected the figures, said: “Continued sunshine and England’s unexpected long World Cup has meant that July follows June’s pattern, where the pubs experienced more sales of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are harder hit now.
The 1.8% decline in restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focusing on the sale of beverages clearly managed best and experienced progress similar to the decline of the restaurants.
Pubber with focus on food led in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
People just seem to want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% per month, while food fell by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, analyzing the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the out-of-home market, the weather and large social or sports events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that the restaurants are still struggling, although a decrease in sales of 4.8% year after year will really hurt above rising costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will give a hard-needed breathing space."
The total increase in sales totaled for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, which shows the decline in new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than £9 billion and they are leading in the area.
Every fifth child has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents
Each five-year-old has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 school students in 4th-9th grade reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content should be posted.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show their parents
Every fifth child up to 11 years old creates accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A 4th grade survey of 20,000 students reveals violent growth in “fake Insta” accounts — a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content should be posted.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show their parents while they also have private.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a teen who called on others to "violate me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s scary that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics at the Annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most winning athlete, and Chairman Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
“Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world in Scotland, Britain and the rest of the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her in the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I will try to be the athletes' voice, and I hope that I can contribute and help outline a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200 and 400 metres races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and is now often a commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transitory ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: "A month ago, I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would show if I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m completely healthy, I’ve learned to go again and do agility exercises today!
“Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Advertising for breast pumps that compare mothers to cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared the opinions online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump,” the technological consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a costume filled with hay, to a song in which it blaws: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you didn't notice it, this isn't overwhelming, it's my breasts."
The vocabulary says, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my breast."
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "fears" of the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth,” a user wrote.

Another writes: “Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another added: "What an insensitive advertising."
Others defended the advertising. A woman admitted that she thought the song was "unbelievable funny."
“I think that’s a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a brilliant product,” one said.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertising aimed at mothers that pumps milk (often at their workplace or in the toilets) and feels like ‘quees’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the milk industry.”
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discrete pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the advertising is based on the fact that many women who are breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no tubes or snakes and fits discreetly in a breast-bh, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, the partner and director of Mother, wrote: “The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while in a entertaining and recognizable way we showed the freedom that the new pump can give.”
It's not the first time that the pump from Elvie has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother of two catwalks went for Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camp at Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, even though the number of borderwalks has not changed. This is partly due to a harder rhetoric and Trump administration’s harder laws that make it harder to place children at sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been unproven immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to stay in the country by standing up and accepting a child.
The return risk rose in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household should give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to Congress and said they had arrested several people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The management later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had pure penalty certificates.
“At close to 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors’ households, stay illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we’re still chasing those people,” said Albence.
In trying to deal with children’s cases faster, the authorities have introduced new rules that require some of them to meet in court within a month after their detention. Before it was within 60 days, help workers say.
Many people use video calls instead of even appearing and speaking their case for legally staying to an Immigration Judge.
Those who are judged unjustified for stay are deported quickly.
The longer children stay in custody, the higher the likelihood that they are getting anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or escape attempts,” says help workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better relationships say that these risks are more pronounced at larger plants like Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on if a child suffers.
They added that relocation to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria announces U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
When Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem spoke to the United Nations General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in the country is now in his eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces’ stay in the country is illegal and under the pretext of combating terrorism, and they will "be met with equivalent funds."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror was "almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleared all Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The U.S. has around 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
In the refugee field, Moualem said that conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused “some Western countries” of “spreading unfounded fears,” which caused refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the EU have warned that no help will be made to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to set up a buffer zone in the last large rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a large attack was avoided by Syrian forces supported by Russia, against the province where three million live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions will go after jihadists from the Nusra Front, a source group of Al-Qaeda, which "will be wiped out".
Staffan de Mistura hopes to call for the first meetings of the new committee to outline a post-war Constitution for Syria and pave the way for a choice.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and says that the panel's work should limit itself to "reviewing the legislation of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
That’s why Trump wins another presidential term.
From that logic, Trump is probably re-elected in 2020 unless the impeachment and scandals end his pre-presidency period, which many liberal viewers probably hope for.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic ending of a presidential period ever!"
Currently, there is no sign of seer fatigue.
Since 2014, viewing figures in the best broadcast time have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time for comparison with 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on evenings with great news.
“It’s a spectacle that people are attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” Neal Baer, head of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, said about a leader of the cabinet, who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and writer bag "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell said.
The chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other TV shows, the stories coming from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade whether refugee families can reunite and the world economy’s health.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged.
And yet, it's about more than being an enlightened citizen when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's turtles jacket for $15,000 ("clothed with hybris", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's live descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
I will never see Super Mario in the same way.
"Something that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's rotating crew and daily surprises (contests with N.F.L, praise Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you are set off.
When I got to Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he recorded CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows before, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Big sums will go to the close mid-term election to the House of Representatives
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of a compensation of two "Congressional Districts" two congressmen struggle for the same seat.
This recent suburban district in Pittsburg creates problems for the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another sitting Congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, overlaps heavily with the new 17.
The cards were converted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January convicted that the old district was unlawfully set up in favor of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has started a struggle for economic funds between the large parties' committee, the Democrats' Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in an election with high attention in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been on the hands of Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a little advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for support for China, but changed its mind.
Diplomas noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out Trump's leadership team.
Officials from the Foreign Ministry decided to call leading American diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in a statement earlier in the month.
But it was only El Salvador who was punished. They received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for bla.narcotics control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include pruning financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials shouted a top conference on security and economic development. It should have continued last year's meeting that was considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thereby dropping considerations of penalties to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October to send a signal of the importance that the Americans put in the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. sent out secretly went back to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new harsh demands or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton of the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke out of a condition of anonymity.
Know the Story
The next obstacle could well be the special accuser Robert Mueller's report of Trump's possible obstruction of the investigation, which there is considerable and publicly available evidence of.
Mueller will also address his investigation into the question of whether Trump's campaign was secretly collaborating with Russia on the attack on the election.
If Congress was to come to a new position, Trump will likely be held accountable while preparing to meet again with the voters and, in time, of course, a jury of his feathers.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump's ultimately is inevitable - and the same goes for his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the game will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to put in with a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not grasp the opportunity to avoid the long-term bloodbath then.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history turns, and the irreversible march of democracy to- or declining.
In the United States, several of these turning points are now faced.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein’s seat has been warm since the present newspaper could announce that he had proposed last year to make hidden recordings of the president and contested his suitability to the office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s recently sought-after investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not conducted in due manner - or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote for a congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who once occupied my embassy's homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to turn on the Sabbath lights on the table with the garden cross.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the fight against SK Rapid Wien
After the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, Rangers will have great opportunities to move forward from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from getting season debut before the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a jumpboard for something even bigger.
“It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went to the fight with the belief that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but all in all, it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last game. But with the audience behind us, I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of all the things that have happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the last season behind us and get success.”
Fear of Retirement Savings Makes Women Sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in Nationswide’s study reported that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
“Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do anything to initiate the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationswide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them in good time about your wishes.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, among other things, by means of a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payout or self-insurance with your own funds - as long as you have finance for it.
Get arranged the legal documents: Take the legal battles in the run-up.
Get prepared a warrant so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes, in case you can’t communicate yourself.
Also consider an economic power.
In this case, you will designate a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the option.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents needs emergency medical attention and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing so you're ready.
“It’s not just a matter of the economy — who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What medication?
Who cares for the dog?
Get the plan in place.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip to the city.
The victim was in the 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as "a very random one."
The victim did not see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police urge witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communication paths are out of play, emergency workers have not been able to receive information from the regentship Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawese province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379.800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regentship that stretches over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regent, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the Central Soulwessian economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala, according to Indonesia’s disaster center, have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called fire ring in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the north of Sumatra triggered on December 26 a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit Sumatra’s west coast in late March and first in April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake that measured 6.8, struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regentship in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing the notification of domestic violence and opposing arrest, according to the report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she attempted to report the alleged crime.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 security guarantee, KTUU reports.
He was prosecuted on Saturday when he declared himself "no guilty," the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which can lead to a penalty on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
The case is currently being dealt with at Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, having prevented the announcement of a violent crime at home, as well as arms possession in the affected state of the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a blow in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining his son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake on Friday hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication pathways, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating that show the moment the earthquake strikes.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami burst to the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get terrorist suspects in NYC sentenced to rare death penalty
Public prosecutors attempt to be sentenced to death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the New York City terrorist attack, who killed eight people - a rare penalty that was last sentenced to a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to carry out an attack on a bike path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who came in the road were grounded.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious personal injury. This is required by the declaration of intent for death penalty in New York's Southern District.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a government jury could present Saipov for a 22-point prosecution, including eight charges of murder in connection with gangster activities, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "inclusive planning and preparations," said the prosecutors, describing Saipov's execution as "unpleasant, malicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, body damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is a decade ago that New York's Southern District last raised the defendant in a case of death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up being sentenced to life in September 2009.
In 1953, the marriage of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg was executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov originated from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, exhibited no signs of regret in the days and months after the attack.
According to police, he said to the investigators that he was doing well with his actions.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hung the ISIS flag up in his hospital room, the police told him.
He has denied himself guilty of the 22 points of the prosecution.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "of course disappointed" over the prosecutors' decision.
“We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong prison sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during a demonstration at the Conservative meeting today.
Former Ukip leader said that politicians had to "mark the pressure" of Euroscepticists - after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said Farage should take over negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Member Peter Bone said to the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have "been out now" if Farage had been a Brexit dealer.
May’s challenge in creating a gathering in the deeply divided party is emphasized by the fact that conservative remnants participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track under attacks by both Brexiteers, Remains and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the backlash, she will continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels - thereby forcing the Euroscepticists and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough's minister added, "I'm going to fight for Brexit, but we're going to scrap Chequers."
On the background of his EU resistance, he said: “We did not fight world wars to be someone’s subordinates.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected that the public’s attitude should have changed since the 2016 vote: “That the British people should have changed their minds and would like to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Now drop Chequers, and start listening."
As a tip note to May, she added: "Premier ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the film that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail the decision from the 2016 vote.
"Now it's a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They want to betray Brexit, but we’re gathered to tell them that we don’t let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class that is on the tip of betraying Brexit can feel the pressure.
"We mobilize the people's army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we don't stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK."
Meanwhile, the remainder marched through Birmingham before a two-hour take-off in the city centre.
Spreaded activists fanged with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made a laugh before the meeting with the security problems of the Conservatives' party app.
“These are the people who claim that they have control over the IT systems and technology of Canada, to the border controls, to free trade without borders in Ireland,” he said.
"It's a whole lot of laughter.
“There’s nothing called a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to run for the presidential election
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "meaning strongly to run for the presidential election" after the mid-term elections in November.
According to Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a council meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, will try to gain re-election against state Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She was wondering if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the City Hall voters since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she was planning to run for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it is time that "women go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front."
Arrested in case of shooting at LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Friday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news conference at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of the injuries,” police chief Murphy J. Paul said.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being present, possessing a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without problems and is now in the police in East Baton Rouge district custody.
Sims was a two-meter high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started inside ten, and played on average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's grand prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role for the race.
From the lead position Bottas got a good start and was close to slowing Hamilton off as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel ran in the pit as the first one, and allowed Hamilton to fight with the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into the pit for a while later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came again in front of the Ferrari driver after some wheel contact reluctantly had to leave the interior court after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round of his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race when he failed to change tires to take the fourth place of Kimi Raikkonen.
He had to go into the pit in the 44th inning, but could not increase the pace of the last eight innings, why Raikkonen secured fourth place.
“It’s a hard day because Valtteri did it amazing all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me get by.
The team did an incredible job to ensure us both first and second place,” Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a polling meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a constituency meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given before the U.S. Senate court committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "vicious and disgusting and dishonest."
“The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at statements and leak, and then they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who leaked it?
Remember her answer... was it you who leaked the document - "oh, oh, what?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, just a minute.
If we've leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the Senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter about Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, as during Saturday's voter meeting said: "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Under the President’s continued defense of the nominee judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexually assault by three women, Trump suggested that Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own case.
“They do not shun any means in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the viciousness, the disgustingness, they don’t care who to drum to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars v. Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did well again after Friday's lost Elite League match against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants came quickly ahead with two goals with attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized on home ground before Dwyer again brought the Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the season's third Elite League defeat for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's Belfast match.
It was the season's fourth meeting between the sides, where Giants went out as victors in the previous three games.
Dwyer set out in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Giants came ahead at the first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard equalized again with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have lost four out of their five matches, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Airline leader died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An airliner in Indonesia is honoured as hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers came safely down to the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a major earthquake on Friday hit the Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks are still raging the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the swaying control tower in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his place to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which kept on the start track, came safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're broken," he added.
The authorities fear that the death toll can reach thousands, and the country's disaster preparedness announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in emergency and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute comes a new ambulance with more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the stores are looted.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re coming to.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work 24 hours a day to perform all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he said.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier in the year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said Saturday afternoon could not locate a male passenger.
The airline announced collaborating with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned on requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew, after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both pronounce that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the landing track.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the landing track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go into water for life to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the crew was panicking and shouting and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors who worked to renovate a quay nearby also helped in the rescue work using a rubber boat to transport people to land before the plane sank at about 30 meters deep.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analyst sets the timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor ended his testimony on Saturday during the prosecution of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analytics in the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, made testimony for several hours as an expert witness in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used teleinformation to compile the course of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had alleged that he, along with his friend Michael Sanford, visited police Sanford.
Sanford sat down in the testimony desk on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "spoke because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death Tellis had deleted Chambers text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He removed her from her life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hiphop?
A hiphoptrio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that the hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in the UK due to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Children's girl in New York is suing couples after firing with "racist" sms
A babysitter in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after being sent an SMS message by an error from the mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they are racists, but compared the lawsuit with "prepressure".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her horror to find out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she appeared on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEJ, NOT A SORT PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, it fired "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice and said that their former nanny, as from African-American, had been bad for her work, and that she instead expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day work and sent home to a Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the fire and compensation for $350 a day in the six months she should have lived with her family, although this was agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't allow yourself to do something like that," she told the newspaper Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves with the fact that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
“We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been unhappy to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your infant?
Honestly."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to “extortion” and that his wife had been born two months before and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you really looking for someone like that?”
It’s not very friendly,” the investment advisor added.
Although the trial is still underway, the international court has already deprecated the couple on social media and harassed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that readers could not relate to a speaking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said about the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was released.
It’s fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington was.”
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little clothes bang, would have been optimistic, although his story was rejected, and that the 60th year of the publication of the books was "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important part of our family” and says her father was proud of her success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to boast," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real for him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: You're proud of them, even though it's not really your profit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington's fault."
Saying goodbye to the dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors were in vain trying to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn’t survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
See you later.
The medication she had received to keep her heart running slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now her body closed down.
I just had to sit there waiting for it to happen.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together.”
Eventually, the mourning Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
“Nobody knew it,” she said.
"I bowed my head, and my tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women are trying to stop suicide shoppers.
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered a depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to experience the sadness I’m experiencing every day,” she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with a infected smile.
His smile was known by everyone.
People said his smile brightened the room.”
However, he stopped working before he died because he was really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he had taken his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it's spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself - you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was sorry or depressed or anything," she said.
“Some days before Christmas, he began to change.
He was really far down Christmas day. When the kids opened their gifts, he didn't have eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic to them, but that they have to get through it: "It's created a hole in our family.
It has torn us apart.
We all have to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear while the FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for — a limited-scale study — we might have a little consensus,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the comedy “fallen from the hind” in the middle of the locked party-shaped situation.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct their investigation?
Their restraint is due to timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans, as expected, are doing badly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to have elected to the country's highest judgeship.
George W. Bush has called Senators to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thus met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has completed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislature.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Confederation Ministry and said there were 1,127 dehoppers last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers were contributing to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The majority of North Korean defectors are now offered citizenship in South Korea.
South Korea’s government said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border offensive to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forced to send home.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is technically still at war, has significantly improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to talk about the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against a nuclear-free Korea at an overall level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will degrade on our own,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit for the Supreme Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for Supreme Court judge, "hysterically" and said that his temper was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, one would have called her hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the accusations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "groteske and a coordinated character courage" arranged by the left wing, which was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential position in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statements proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was pre-eminent to the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi went beyond when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh for a impeachment if he is confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he doesn't speak true to Congress or the FBI, he's not suitable for sitting in the Supreme Court, but certainly rather in the court he's sitting in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in connection with Obama's health reform or abortion case Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would reconsider certain previous Supreme Court rulings.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, pre-empted person must contest a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just wonderful'," Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, several months and years of anger that commences, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I got great support from a woman who was the boss who said she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the one she spoke with: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept on.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken at the neck by an older woman — a cold boss that I had always been a little scared of — and pulled out on the stairs.
“You must never let them see you cry,” she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll accept that they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress of the Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed in having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could just as well stand up as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly didn’t need another candidate.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind fundraising, so she promised that she would not attend unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” she thought.
When she gave a speech that she wouldn’t stand up, she was overwhelmed by feelings — thankfulness for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach out to voters instead of electors, and anger over sexism — that she got a lump in her throat.
“You could think I was getting a nervous intercourse,” Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
"You should think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what will I write on my tombstone?
“She was crying.”
This is how the trade war between the United States and China can benefit Beijing.
The openings of the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, divisions between the countries can be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by placing customs on important Chinese export goods, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The largest escalation this week with new customs duties affecting goods for a value of $200 billion, in principle, applies to half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, most recently by placing customs duties of 5-10% on US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second-largest economy probably doesn't give after just preliminary.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its demands, it means they give up, but for China’s president, Xi Jinping, it will be too embarrassing to bow for the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the American pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
“A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a groove for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it is actually much more dangerous than it was thought,” said Abigail Grace, researcher with a focus on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for refugees to return, and asks for help in building the country that is destroyed by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country were in recovery.
“Today, the situation is more stable and safe thanks to the successful fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and works to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now present for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011 when the war began.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to accept help to rebuild the devastated land.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped support the revolt.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated the U.S. team 16.5 - 10.5 in the Le Golf National outside of Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had difficulty in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake at pairs 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and was 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament's current format started.
Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest-ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
#1 on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the baggage, Spain's Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning Europeans with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It’s a team effort and I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He sends the torch to his countryman John Ram, who fell the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It is a sweep statistics for one of the best golfers ever who has won 14 major titles, only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had all weekend trouble finding the shape except by Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing appearance: "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for the matter.
There was still time this morning when we opposed Europe.
We lost.
Hats off for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will cooperate with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we will move on.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten the hat.
We were defeated.”
