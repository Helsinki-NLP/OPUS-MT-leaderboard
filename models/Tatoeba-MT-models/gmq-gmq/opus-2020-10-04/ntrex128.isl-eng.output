Well - being stewards are worried about “appearing as fools ”
Uggur is in some stewards because of the proposal to change their titles to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Senate's Planet).
Anxiety is caused by a plan to change the name of the Council to the Danish Congress.
Housekeepers from all sides are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
One employee manager said that his group was worried because “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers who live outside Wales: in the monarch, twp means stupid, and pwp means dirt.
A trustee of Plaid Cymru said that the whole group was “unsatisfied ” and made other suggestions.
A minister of the Danish Conservative said that his group had “open mind ” on the name change, but pointed out that there was no great difference between the word MWP and Muppet.
In this context, it can be stated that the Polish letter w is similar to u in Icelandic.
The Council, now working on a legal launch to present the name changes, said: “The final determination of all names of the members of the council will of course lie with the members themselves. ”
The Law on the Government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) empowered the Swedish Council to change its name.
In June, the Council published a public survey that showed great support for calling the Council the Sanhedrin.
With regard to the title of stewards, the WMP (Welsh Parliament members, well-known MEPs) was selected, but the MWP was most supported by the public in surveys.
News reports now make other suggestions, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement with the President of the Council, Elin Jones, who is to submit a draft on the changes within a few weeks.
The text of the reform will also include other changes in the way the Council works, including rules on the dismissal of the stewards and the organisation of the committee system.
Ministers will be able to pay final votes on their title when discussions on the draft begins.
Macedonians vote in the elections for the name change of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to “The Republic of North Macedonia. ”
This issue was voted in an attempt to solve decades of conflict with the neighbouring Greece, whose own territory is Macedonia.
The Athens has long argued that their northern neighbours' name corresponds to their area requirements and has repeatedly objected to their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gerge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said that he will not consider the elections valid.
However, supporters of the votes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church clock when churches in Harlem have problems
“ The older people I’ve been talking to said that once before there was a bar and church on every corner, ” said Mr. Adams.
“ Today neither is found there. ”
He said it's understandable that bars would fall.
“ People have other ways to meet, ” he said today.
“ Bars are no longer the centers of the neighborhood where people gather regularly. ”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money that comes from the sale of possessions will not last as long as leaders expect “and sooner or later they will be back in the beginning. ”
He added, then, that possible churches could be replaced by houses full of people who will not help save the nearby refugees.
“ The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will become white, ” he said, “and will therefore hurry for these churches to be permanently closed, for it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches. ”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church a decade later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original white Methodist congregation moved away.
A congregation of blacks who had served in the neighborhood took over the building.
The Black Congregation took over St. Martin’s Church under the direction of Father John Howard Johnson, who took the initiative to avoid tradingmen on the 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who desired to hire black workers or to give them an increase in their status.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but the members of Father Johnson’s congregation made plans to rebuild it, and they also built the clock card.
Father David Johnson, a son and successor of Father Johnson, proudly called the watch game “the watches of the poor. ”
In July, the expert who played the watch game called it a different name: “Children ” and“ a unique historical instrument. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also stated that this was the first watch game in the world that a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played, moved over to a larger watch game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't get anyone else in his place.
Over the past few months, many architects and entrepreneurs have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders and others from the Bishop district.
In July, the Church Council, which supervises the attendance and is appointed church leaders, wrote to the Bishop district and expressed its concern that the Bishop district “will endeavor to bring the costs over to ” the church council, even though it had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and the entrepreneurs sent by the Bishop.
Some congregation members complained of the lack of transparency of the Bishop district.
A shark hurts a 13 - year - old boy who drowned for a humming in California
According to the authorities, a 13 - year - old shark attacked a boy and wounded on Saturday when the boy was diving for a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack took place just before 7: 00 a.m., near Beacon’s Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then rode over along with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said at first that it was just anxious to get a lobster, but then “he realized that the boy cried out,“ I was bit!
I was bitten!"
All his bracelet was torn up," Hammel said about what he saw when he came to the boy.
“ I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, “There is a shark in the water! ” added Haim.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he's seriously wounded.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
At a press conference, Larry Giles, head of the Coast Guard, said that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type of sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper body.
The authorities closed a coastal access from the Ponto Beach coast in Casablad to the Swami’s coast in Encinitas for 48 hours, in the interests of research and safety.
Giles said that more than 135 different species of sharks were in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s with a plan to rehabilitate on the UK Coastal Market
Sainsbury’s will fight with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with cottages in the shopping centre style and with specialized assistants.
This is part of the plan to enter the UK's costume market, worth 2.8 billion pounds and increasing as fashion and household sales are decreasing.
Investing in cosmetics is part of a marketed way to use a recreational space that was previously new to television, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury’s claims that it will double its product selection for up to 3000 product types, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have increased space with marked areas similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
The trade will also resume the sale of Boutique product selection so that the majority of the products are road-friendly, but younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the parfume store Fragrance Shop will test a commodity position in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Network trade and an increased tendency for consumers to buy a small amount of food every day in the neighborhood stores means that major markets need more effort to get people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury’s, said that the shops would look more and more like shopping centres when the trade chain is trying to fight the low-shop Aldi and Lidl with more services and other goods than food.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos camps in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat camps since the purchase of both chains two years ago.
The first attempt by the store to resuscitate their cottage and medication departments was not successful.
Sainsbury’s tried to cooperate with Boots around 2000, but this ended because of differences in how to share the revenue of the major markets.
The new policy comes as Sainsbury’s sold its 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical stores, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a great selection of luxury product products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s marketing director, said: “We have completely altered the appearance of our product shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be provided for advice.
Our product selection is designed to meet all needs. Fascinating environments and comfortable locations make us an exciting cottage store that transforms old trade habits."
Peter Jones “Everything ” After Holly Willoughby retires 11 million pounds of contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became “earth ” after the TV analyst Holly Willoughby terminated a £11 million contract with his company to focus on new agreements with Mark and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home product and delivery marks, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, the brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, 37 years of age, announced his decision on Instagram in The Morning.
Holly Willoughby has understood Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, with the painful forehead by discontinued participation in a popular lifestyle company in the last hour to focus on new and rewarding agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones has been “everlasting ” at a difficult Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his trade empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the TV woman popularly admitted that she had not enough time for the Truly product brand, because of the new contracts worth up to £ 1.5 million.
The company has been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s trademark, and was intended to double Willoughby’s property, an estimated value of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced in Instagram that she was going to retire from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to stay in one of her many summer homes.
A source reported: “Truly was the longest on Holly’s priority list.
This was supposed to be her future project, which would earn it for the next two decades.
Her decision to quit was completely open to everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line would go to the market.
There's a full layer of lips in Marlow's headquarters that are ready to go to sale."
Experts believe that this Morning, among the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions of dollars because of heavy product investments, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and may cause further delays in the sale of the product line.
This could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends of Jones and his wife, Töra Capp, for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly and Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as President of the Executive Board in March.
The couple spend their summer vacations together, and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin, a company that produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S trademark and will replace Ant McPartlin as the director of the I-TV programs I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
Difficult Discussions “and We Were Became Loved ”
He blasphemed with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for the president, and for being so positive toward the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given so much in?
Said Trump and simulated the voice of a reporter.
“I haven’t left anything behind. ”
He pointed out that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards nuclear decommissioning North Korea.
On the other hand, discussions about the decommissioning of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the chief ambassador of North Korea, told an international leader of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday to the north that the United States had not received “an appropriate response ” at the first steps towards nuclear decommissioning.
Instead, he said that the United States continued to uphold trade bans in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was all more positive in his speech.
“We are in great harmony with North Korea, ” he said.
“ We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now, our relationship is great."
He said his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results - missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the earthly remnant of American soldiers were returned home.
He also warned his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“ It’s so easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter a trough stadium, there were only 200 people standing there, ” said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
An Indonesian flooding and earthquake are causing great damage to the island, hundreds of which have died
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, an international aid organization was told that it was not necessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants had to flee their homes, there was no need for emergency, which is the prerequisite for the international organization to be able to engage in relief activities there.
“ Sadly, in many cases they have clearly stated that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organizations, so this is difficult, ” said Miss Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children organization is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain when foreign aid workers can start work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disaster Institute, said that Indonesian government officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to assist in the relief work.
In view of the number of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly unprepared to protect its natural forces.
The flood waves have been built in Aceh, which is rarely seen at other coastlines.
The lack of flood - wave - protection in Palu seems to have increased the number of deaths, even if a warning has been issued.
Even in the best situation, traveling between the many Indonesian islands can be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A sick ship that has been lying at the port of Lombok to support the earthquake’s victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made it the main priority of his campaign to improve the depressed routes of Indonesia, and he has put a lot of money in the way and railroads.
However, financial shortages have plagued Mr. Joko’s government, but next year, elections will be held.
Mr. Joko also faces persistent tension between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religious policy.
Over 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes when Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with swedes, bows, and arrows, and other basic weapons.

“ I saw Kante come and touched once, and I didn’t think so much about it, but I just took the shot. ”
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
The Chelsea prosecutor gave the ball with a heel to Mateo Kovacic and then jumped from the center to the Liverpool play half.
Kovacic had the ball move fast in the middle.
Then he sent the ball beautifully forward, and sent Hazard in for a savage.
Hazard ran off and scored the remote corner with a left footshot by Alisson Becker, a target of Liverpool.
Liverpool is at Napoli in the forefront of the election department at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo stadium in Napoli, Italy.

The number of dead rises to 832 after a flooding wave in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and the flooding wave in Indonesia has increased to 832, according to a report from the National Disaster Institute early on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the Institute, said at a press meeting that a number of people had underwent when buildings collapsed in the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 points on the Richter scale.

Police arrest a 32-year-old suspect of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder study has been initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
At 7:55 this morning, a 44 - year - old woman was found near Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32 - year - old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have encouraged people in the area to submit if they saw or heard anything.
Brian O'Hagan, U.S.A., said: “The investigation has just started, but I would like to ask all those in the neighborhood of John Street, Birkenhead, to contact us if they saw or heard something suspicious.
I would also like to ask all, especially a cab driver, who could have reached something on a picture with their car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our study."
The police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
Today, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police claim to be working on informing the nearest victims.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was without words when he discovered what had happened.
The people have now been told that hours may pass until they are allowed to return.
A police officer heard a man say that the whole area was now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She repeats: “This is so horrible. ”

Any person who may have any information is asked to send a direct message at @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Line anonymously on phone 0800 555 111 and provide the 247 number from September 30.
The British Congress of Cromwell is the latest memorial accused of “rewriting history ”
The ban on the statue would be poetic justice for the Israeli destruction of his violent puritanian escorts on so many cultural and religious preciouss of England.
The Cromwell Company, however, said that Mr. Crick's suggestion was "the trick" and "the attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion of removing statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace was inevitable.
The opposition of the English civil war against cultural symbols was neither a command nor a execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for his forefather Thomas’ actions in the preceding century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a sign of the era of the 19th century, and is part of the history of a man who many people believe is still worthy of praise.
To The Sunday Telegraph, Mr. Goldsmith said: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, to be the guardian of the Congress against external pressure, in his case the kingdom.
The fact that this description is all true is still a matter of history.
However, the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century may have shaped the development of our nation and Cromwell is a well - known person who represents one side of their conflict.
It is worth the pleasure and remembrance of his accomplishments as the Protector of the State."
Swine attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in southwestern China, according to local reports.
The man named “Yuan ” was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood near the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou, according to South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farm prepares to inject vaccines to pigs in a pig's stallion on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
According to his uncle, he had traveled from the neighborhood of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and saw that the door to the nearest porcine stairs was open.
He said that inside the stove was a big barrel with a bloody mouth.
A trial confirmed that the 250 kg of the chicken killed the farmer, according to the report.
“ My uncle’s feet were bloody and wounded, ” said his uncle, who had the last name “Wu, ” at the Guiyang Evening News.
A camera recording showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market said to Evening News that the pig was locked in so that it did not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence in the field.
According to news, Yuan’s family and market owners have discussions about remedy for his death.
There are examples of pigs attacking people, although rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a wife and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and seriously wounded the man.
Ten years earlier, a well - grown farmer clamped 300 kg of pigs at a tractor until his wife frightened the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood flavouring can induce aggression in them.
“ They're just playing.
They like to be curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them," he said.
The remnant of the hurricanes of Rose brings heavy rainfall over the southwestern part of the United States
As prophesied, the strength of the hurricane of Russia is decreasing as it crosses the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will produce a great amount of rain that could result in floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa became a class 1, with a wind force up to 136 km/h, at 5 in the morning to the eastern coastal time on Sunday, and was located over 600 km/h southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is estimated that Rosa will go north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific has been developed, and it will go east towards the west coast of the United States, so when Rosa arrives at the Baja California River on Monday as a tropical storm, a great tropical shore will follow north into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm of precipitation in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the next few days, the tropical shaft will mix with the approaching lows and produce large and widespread precipitation over the southwestern part.
Local rainfalls of 2.5 to 10 cm may cause dangerous floods, soil movements, and potential crawls in the desert.
A large tropical rocket will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of rainfall per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected in some places in the southwest, especially in the Arizona region.
The spread of tropical rains makes it possible for rapid floods to deteriorate rapidly.
People are strongly advised to avoid walking into the wilderness when there is a risk of tropical rainfall.
A great rain can turn giants into winding rivers, and thunderstorms can result in storms and duststorms.
The approaching level will bring local rainfall in certain areas at the coastal coast of South California.
There is a potential for more than 1 cm of rain, which could cause minor movement of soil and road hail.
This is the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before rainfall spreads over a larger area late on Monday and Tuesday.
A great rainfall will spread across four counties on Tuesday and lasts on Wednesday.
In October of the United States, much heat changes can be expected as the Arctic region is cooling, but the tropical tropical area continues to be rather warm.
At times, this can cause high temperature fluctuations over short distances.
There was a very good example of high temperature differences in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 7 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
The next few days sustained summer breeds will try to rebuild and disperse.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern United States will begin on October with a temperature of approximately 25 degrees or more from the southern plains to the northeastern states.
A temperature may rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long - term weather prophecy indicates that there is a high risk of temperature over the average of the eastern part of the United States in the first half of the October month.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh for interrogation
Over 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual fraud that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980 ’ s.
At the same time, the political patt status continued, and television stations suspended a regular program to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, Arizona Senator, proposed a bill for the FBI to investigate the accusations for one week.
Ford told the judicial committee of the Senate that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunken her and tried to dispose of her at a school party.
Kavanaugh gave emotional evidence that he was confident that this had not happened.
More people likely watched the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company measured the average views on the TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other television channels showing the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen, too, usually finds it difficult to measure people’s views in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar to the size of a football game or the Oscar Prize Festival.
According to Nielsen, most people watched the interrogation that took all day at the Fox News Channel, or 5.69 million, and their channels have loyally supported the designation of Kavanaugh.
ABC was second - placed with 3.26 million audiences.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest was still great after the trial.
Flake was the center of the fairy tale on Friday.
After the office of this Senator of the Republic Group announced that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS took pictures of the protestant screaming at him on Friday morning when he tried to enter a lift to get to a meeting with the Justice Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while shortly raining over him in direct broadcast at CNN.
One woman said, “I'm standing right here in front of you. ”
“ Do you think he is telling the truth to the people of the country? ”
People said to him: “You have authority while so many women are without power. ”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he said that he would express himself more in the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations all had a direct broadcast later when the Justice Committee decided whether to forward Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Senate’s elections.
Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the accusations against the appointed one next week, but the minority of the Democrats have encouraged it.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator of Democrats.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and some other Senators.
Flake’s vote was important because it was evident that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has authorized the FBI's investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
Britain’s Prime Minister, May, accuses critics of being “in a political game ” because of Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, President Theresa May accused its critics of the European Union of “being in a political game ” of the future of Britain and burying the interests of the country.
Theresa May, United Kingdom Prime Minister, attends the Birmingham Conservative Conference of 29 September 2018.
In a second interview published next to her interview on the cover of the paper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, said that the so - called Chequers program on Brexit was “always abstract. ”
Wayde Sims shot: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested one suspect for the death of Wayde Sims in a deadly shooting assault, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for charge of second-grade murder, according to Baton Rouge Police.
The authorities published a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and said that Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glasses in the scene and said they found genetics from Simpson on them, according to WAFB, CBS sisterhood.
The police say Simpson confessed to the interrogation to have shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, there was a certain guarantee of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Bureau of the Court of Justice published a preliminary report on Friday that says the cause of death is a gunshot in the head and down the neck.
The authorities wanted to thank the police in Louisiana, the police lab, the police at the Southern University University, and the civilians in the area for the assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, chairman of LSU sports, thanked the lawmen “for their zeal and their search for righteousness. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
In Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played a basketball for LSU, the high - grown two - yard progeny grew up.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and took 2.6 reports for each game in the last season.
On Friday morning, Dr. Will Wade, basketball coach LSU, said that the people were “harmed ” and“ in shock ” because of the death of Wayde.
“ This is something you constantly worry about, ” said Wade.
A volcano spouts ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention in the United States, on Saturday, the Mexicans recommended stay away from the volcano after the activity of the giant increased and reported 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a period of 24 hours.
The center observed vibrating and trembling from the volcano.
Images on the social media showed a thin layer of ash on car windows in Mexico’s neighborhoods, such as in Xochimilco.
Earth physicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of up to 7.1 on Richter crossed central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo, ” has been active since 1994.
Police fighting Catalan apartheid just before the birthday of the Independence Charter
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent Protestants intervened with a police police force, and thousands were involved in protests for the first birthday of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked apartheids stoned an egg - insurgent police and casted a dust paint that produced a dark cloud of dust on the streets, usually filled with tourists.
Conflicts also broke out later the other day, and the police used bats to keep fights under control.
A group of separatists cried out, “We will not forget and not forgive ” for a few hours while their opposers cried out, “Long live Spain. ”
Fourteen people needed care for minor injuries in the protests, according to local media.
A year after the 1st October national vote was convicted illegally by the Madrid authorities, the Catholic separatists celebrated great tension.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but participation was poor, since most opposers ignored the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop the elections across the region, which resulted in conflict.
A group of independenceists had stayed overnight on Friday to prevent protests to support the police.
The anticipation process took place, but it was forced to go a different way.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electric engineer, participated in the protests of a separationist with his wife and said that he was no longer hopeful of Katalonia’s independence.
“ In the past, we experienced some of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy over being able to choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the necessity but slight victory of regional triumphs last December, Catalonia’s independent groups have had difficulty keeping low this year, since many of the most famous leaders are either voluntarily exiled or held in custody after trial because of their role in organising the voting fee and the independent declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who took the protests to the support of the police on their phone, said that the politicians of both states had encouraged the conflict.
“ The tension is increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned and asked for trial since the late last year, announced that he would volunteer to the European Council next year.
“My proposition in the European elections is the best way to condemn the reversal of democratic values and the oppression that we have seen the Spanish government use, ” he said.

It is also possible that the crossbow was shot toward the car.
A multitude of scores in a 1-0 winning Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first mark guaranteed Livingston’s victory
The body of Livingston, who came from the lower department, came open to Rangers, and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as Ibrox’s manager.
Mark Dolly Menga made the luck and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team has not yet worked in the elite section of this season and is playing at Heart’s, eight-point - first, on Sunday.
For that game, Rangers will meet Rapid Vienna in the European Division on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the division with six wins, and Coach Holt has still not had to experience losses since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities for bitless guests
Holt's team should have been over long before it scored, but their bones caused a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot by after sliding through the defense to receive a bald transmission from Graig Halkett across the market.
The guest donors allowed Rangers to play quietly in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble in the right places.
And that is how the goal was challenged.
Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga together, who accepted a shipment and scored from the center of the cradle.
At that stage, Rangers had ruled the ball, but the local defense was unbreakable, and Liam Kelly, a target guard, did not have to put forth much effort.
Thus it continued into the second half of the game, although Alfredo Morelos was able to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the legs of Allan McGregor, Rangers' target, and Lithgow shot from a target after the launch from Livingston.
Questions were continually caught in Livingston's suit, but were kicked off, and two demands for a wet test -- after Halkett's defense against Glenn Middleton, and one afterwards - was dismissed.
“ Excellent ” of Livingston Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, reporter of BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Stadium
Excellent performance and final for Livingston.
For a normal man, they did a great job and continued to carry out all their expectations on their way up.
Their styles and teams have hardly changed since they got back to the top, but Holt deserves great praise for having chewed up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, a supervisor, was very good, and he was in charge of a fully organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they've been under Gerrard's control, they've been much better than expectations.
They failed to complete their quests and managed only once to open the half of the locals, so this should be a wake-up for Rangers who are now sitting in the middle of the division.
Erdogan receives blended reception in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, it was a smile and a bright sky.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two NATO nations.
There have been differences between them on grounds such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey’s entry into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is the home of most Turks without Turkey’s own.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters came near her to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestant against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also heard and condemned both the Erdogan policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
The two protestant groups reflect the controversy of this guest, who is welcomed as a hero of some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator of others.
Deptford conflict: A wheelman died in a car collision
A wheelman died in a car crash in London.
The collision took place near the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a widespread street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10:15 p.m. to British local time.
The driver stopped, and medical officers provided care, but the man died at an accident.
The collision occurred a few months after another biker died in a crash when a driver drove off on Childers Street, 1.5 km from the accident site of Saturday.
The police said that she was working on identifying the man and informing his closest members.
The road has been closed and directed by buses, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards were injured in riots
Six prison guards were injured when riots broke out in a security prison for men, according to a prison agency announcement.
At 9.30 C.E., a storm broke out in the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire to the British local time on Sunday and continues to burst.
“ Tornado ” specialists have been called in the area to try to control the inconvenience of eight prisoners and are only in one arm of the prison.
The guards were cared for because of minor face injury at the scene.
“ Specially trained prison guards have been called out to deal with cases in Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have been cared for for damage.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the officers will be handed over to the police and might expect to spend even more time behind lock and bar."
More than 500 prisoners are in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison manager was announced to have to go to a hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October last year, the police were called to the site to cope with serious peace disorder, where people were attacked with billiard bubbles.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with rapid flooding (descent areas may benefit)
It is uncommon to pass tropically across Arizona, but it is likely that early in the next week when the rest of the hurricanes of Rose crosses the southwestern part, at risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Agency has already issued warnings for rapid flooding before Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona and the south and west of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rosa will cross Phoenix directly on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with a rainfall.
On Twitter, the Phoenix Weather Service said that “only ten winds have been able to maintain the strength to be classified as tropical storms or lower than 320 kilometers away from Phoenix from 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 64 km away from Arizona border."
The last prediction from the center of the windstorm predicts 5 to 10 cm of rainfall, with a single result up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely that there will be a rainfall of 2.5 to 5 cm in other southwestern regions, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with the possibility of a unique result of up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of rapid flooding, the precipitation of Rose may be a blessing because there are a lot of droughts in the area.
Although flooding may cause great harm, some of this result will have a positive effect, which is now dry in the southwestern part.
According to the United States Desert Control, at least 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest, is dry, ” according to weather.com news.
First, the hurricane of Rosa will land in Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa still ranked as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 136 km/h, 620 km/h south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm crosses cooler seas in the Pacific, so its power is decreasing.
So it is expected that it will land in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday or Monday night.
In some areas of Mexico, there is a potential for a large amount of rainfall, with a considerable risk of flooding.
“A rainfall is expected up to 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwestern Sonora, with the potential of up to 25 cm of rain, ” said the Weather.com report.
Rosa will then travel north over Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach the borders of Arizona early on Tuesday morning as a tropical place, and will then continue up through Arizona and arrive at the southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
“ The greatest danger expected from Russia or its remnant is a very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora, and in the southwestern part of the United States, ” said the National Rainstorm Center.
These rainfalls are expected to cause life - threatening floods and soil movements in the wilderness, and crawling in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton assault: 4 arrests for murder
Three adolescents and a 20 - year - old man have been arrested for a murder attempt, after a 16 - year - old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The youth was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 p.m. to British local time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition was said to be “stabilised. ”
One 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - olds, and one 20 - year - old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police have been waiting for a witness who could have phone recordings of what happened to them.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “has got to feel the evil and the wrath of the Democrats.
“A vote to support the judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the cruel and disgraceful methods of the Democrats, ” said Trump at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had “to feel the evil and the wrath ” of the Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Assembly on Thursday, where he hardly denounced Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he had sexually offended her a few decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed to the Committee about his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that “Americans had seen Kavanaugh’s genius and manpower and courage. ”
“The statute of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a magnificent CV as an official,” he said to a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of the members of the Republic to participate in the mid - period decisions.
“ There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't volunteer, but I really do," he said.
“ That’s why I go across the fields to fight for great candidates. ”
Trump claimed that the Democrats were working on “stoping and blocking. ”
The first key vote on the Elderly Division's floor on the nomination of Kavanaugh should be carried out no later than Friday, according to the representative of the Republican leaders in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died after an earthquake and a flooding wave in Indonesia, and likely to increase the number of dead
At least 384 died, and many were scattered away when huge waves hit the beach, when a great earthquake and a flood wave swept over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the coast of Palu on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] of waves burst on the beach at sunset, washed out a number of people on the sea and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The tsunami developed after an earthquake of 7.5 points at Richter.
“ When the flood threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they died, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesia Disaster Institute, at an information meeting in Jakarta.
“ The tsunami didn’t come alone, she pulled cars, tree drums, houses, she hit everything on the land, ” said Nugroho, adding that the flooding wave had traveled over the open sea at 800 miles [800 km] before it hit the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the flood wave and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the Catastrophe Institute showed many ruined buildings and shops, twisted and degraded bridges, and mosque surrounded water.
The following earthquakes continued to ride over the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were observed in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute of Food and Technological Use stated that the energy released in the big tremor on Friday would have been about 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geographic location at the end of a long and narrow flea could have increased the size of the flood wave, said the Agency.
Nugroho said that the damages were “very ” and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had collapsed.
The body of some victims was found trapped under a brake of collapsed buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the losses and damages could be more along the coastline 300 kilometers north of Palu in an area called Donggala, nearer the earthquake.
“ The communication is completely downward, and no information is received from Donggala, ” said Nugroho.
“ More than 300,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to that area.
“ This is already a tragedy, but could be much worse, ” said the Red Cross.
The Agency was criticized by many people on Saturday for not informing them about the fact that a flood wave had devastated in Palu, although official representatives said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published on the media, one heard a shouting from the upper floor of buildings to warn the people on the street below that a flood wave was approaching.
Just minutes later, the tsunami on the beach takes away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused electricity loss, which prevented Palu’s communication and made it difficult for the authorities to organize relief work.
According to the authorities, the Army has begun sending aircraft by means of food supplies from Jakarta and other cities, but people who have been helped by the area still need food and other needs.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for aid and will be closed until October.
Joko Widodo, President is going to visit refugee centers in Palau on Sunday.
The number of deaths reaches over 800 following a flooding wave in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
The people of the World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where they seek refuge in tent cities that were set up in the park outside their offices.
“ People said they saw many houses ruined, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Help - working groups have started a difficult relief work, but some have complained that foreign aid workers with a high degree of expertise were hindered from traveling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and staff can only be started if the accident area is declared a disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“ This is still a local accident area, ” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open for foreign aid, but no declaration has yet been made."
When the second night fell over Pala after the earthquake and the flooding on Friday, friends and their families, who are still missing, hoped that their loved ones would be one of the miraculous tales of hopeful depressing headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a reunion.
On Sunday, helpers rescued a woman who had been trapped in ruins for two days with her mother’s body next to him.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian flying team, had been the trainer of two missing flyers for the Asian games that ended earlier in Indonesia.
Others who were locked in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“As a man with long experience in flying, I have my own emotional burden to carry, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after the news was received within the flying group because the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he would have sent a message to the racers who stayed in Palu and participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, showed only a grey mark, instead of blues.
“I think it means that the message was not received, ” he said.
Thieves steal $26.750 at a Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed 26,750 bucks from Brink's staff, who was filling in a Newport on the Leveee speed bank, according to a Newport police report.
The driver of the car had been emptying a fast bank in the entertainment area and was filling more money on it, said Detective Dennis McCarthy, in the announcement.
When he was in his job, another man “runs back to the Brink employee ” and steals a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects flee from the scene, according to the announcement, but the police did not give up the number of cases.
Those who might have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police at phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West, the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to Ye.
He announced the change in Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The creature previously known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change occurs in his participation in the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to announce his new record, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi in the show, but she resigned for “emotional reasons, ” said the manufacturer of the shows.
West has said before that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a shortening of his present name.
“ I believe “ye ” (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you, ” said West earlier in the year when he discussed the name of his album with the radio show manager Big Boy.
“ So I am you. I am us.
It left Kanye, which means the only one, and just Ye, to be just a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, everything.
The record is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous rapists who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former colleague of West, has also written his name both with and without a string and a capital.
The elected President of Mexico promises not to use the military against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians, now the country will soon remember 50 years of bloody revenge against students.
On Saturday in the Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised that “the army will never use it to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful protest march in the marketplace and drowned up to 300 people at a time when the left - hand movements of students were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving monthly support to all students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of study opportunities attract young people to gangs of crime.
The United States should double the artificial funding
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the funds it spends in research in this field, says the inventor and the artificial user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were reported after the United States’ various departments of the U.S. government announced artificial intelligence, even though the United States did not have a formal overall plan for artificial intelligence.
China, on the other hand, announced its previous plan: it is intended to be the first in the new generation with artificial intelligence before 2030.
“ It would be a good start to double the funding that goes into artificial research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the artificial field, ” Lee said.
A double of funding could double the chances for the next major discovery of artificial intelligence in the United States, said Lee to the CNBC during this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, ” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the head of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the major artificial companies in China.
He worked with an artificial intelligence system in the 1980 ’ s at Carnegie Mellon University, who won the best player in the United States in Othello, and later he was director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee spoke of previous technical races held by the U.S. authorities, such as the Automotive Defense Department, and asked when the next race would be held to discover the next primer.
Scientists in the United States often have to put forth a lot of effort to gain the strength of the government, says Lee.
“ It is not China’s main thinking, but the companies, ” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired genius from colleges to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its artificial research.
“ I think those who have a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence should have a residence permit automatically, ” he said.
In July 2017, China’s Congress published its future satellite program.
China’s National Science Foundation, like the National Science Foundation and the same official organizations in the United States, provides funds for people who work at the University Institutes, but the quality of scientific work in China is worse, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defence Department set up an artificial intelligence center designed to cooperate with both industrial and educational institutions, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee of artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
In the case of NSF, it invests over 100 million dollars a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the United States legislation, which was designed to provide a safety advice on artificial intelligence, has not been available for months.
Macedonians vote in national votes on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a national vote on whether to change the name of the country to “the Republic of North Macedonia” in an attempt to solve decades of conflict with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a region called Macedonia and claims that their northern neighbours' name corresponds to their territory and therefore refuses their entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the self - image of the majority of Macedonia’s inhabitants of a slavic background.
Gerge Ivanov, President has said that he will not take part in the vote and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will achieve 50 percent of the minimum required for the vote payment to be valid.
The question on the polling bill is: “Would you like to walk in NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece? ”
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is a fair price for Macedonia to join alliances such as the EU and NATO, which is one of those created after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“ I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people in Macedonia so that they could live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us, ” said the 79 - year - old Olivera Georgievska, in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, enough congressmen have said that they will follow it and bind it into law.
The name change would require the acceptance of two thirds of the Congress.
The election committee said that no unusual report was made at 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent, were involved in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“ I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 - year - old in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, Zorica’s wife, and Dushko’s son voted in the Macedonian national vote on whether to change the name of the country, which would lead to Nato and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Congress, 54 - year - old Vladimir Kavardarkov worked to prepare a small field and set up chairs in front of tents built by those who would ignore the vote.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to be members with our heads high, not going through the service door, ” said Cavardarkov.
“ We are a poor land, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says that a member of NATO will transfer the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
“I believe the longest majority will agree, ” said Zaev, “for more than 80 percent of the EU’s and NATO’s citizens will agree. ”
He said that acceptance would be “a confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from Macedonia’s National Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the national contribution, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another poll from the Telma TV television channel showed that 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they were going to say yes.
So national votes are considered valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious shock for the Western Government's policy from the beginning of May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, player of Manchester City, goes through all the defense of Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made it easy to defend Brighton in winning Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculous when he scored his goal in 65 minutes.
At the start of the campaign, the Argentinaian surgeon received a shipment in the middle of the field.
He jumped past three defensive men of Brighton and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green - dressed defenders.
He got past one defender and then ran away from another one just at Brighton's.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English prominent used the first touching within the body to send the ball back to Aguero, which used the right foot to play on Mathew Ryan, the target Brighton, with a shot on the right side of the mark.
“Aguero is in some foot problems, ” said Pep Guardiola, City’s manager, to the press.
“ We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky he scored at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the first blue mark in the elite game.
That mark came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a shipment in the middle of Brighton's halfway in that fetch.
He sent a beautiful long ball on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent to Sterling toward the remote pole.
The prominent city sent the ball to the net just before it ran out of it.
City plays at Hoffenheim in Championship at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a play against Rockies.
Since the Nationals team has been excluded from playback, there was little reason to force another start.
But the enthusiastic Scherzer hopes to be thrown on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a chance to get to the finals, but they have one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the western division.
Rockies at least got a Wildcard seat with their 5-2 wins at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still trying to get their first division title.
“ Even if we play free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver, as well as the other team will certainly play their best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete in such a situation?"
Nationals will still report who will be the first caster in the Sunday game, but they are thought to have Scherzer thrown in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting a game for the 34th time, took a practice session on Thursday and would throw on a Sunday, which is usually his Sabbath.
This right-handed thrower at Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 wind blows in 220 2/3 rounds in this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
In fact, the president referred to the case around Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge, as he spoke of the importance of the participation of the supporters of the Republics in the mid - period surveys.
“ Everything is at stake in November.
It's five weeks in one of our most important elections.
This is one of the big, big... I don't volunteer, but do it, so I go across the fields to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, radical group of democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means they need, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they're going to go to take over and rule, they just want to have authority, we don't give it to them.
He said that the Democrats were working on “stoping and blocking. ”
“And it has been seen for the past four days, ” he said and said, “the Democrats are angry and wicked and cruel and unreasonable.”
He named the Senate Senator Dianne Feinstein, a ruling demokrat of the Senatorial Committee, and he was answered by a loud voice from the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who failed the document?
Ha, what.
No, look, no, I waited for one... it was really bad body training, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The team of workers is no longer an intolerant church.
He Can Can’t Cope With Those Who Express His Mind
When the activist Momentum in my group chose to give me a reproof, it hardly surprised me.
After all, I am the last of many of the workers who have been told that we are not welcome, just to express our feelings.
Joan ryan, my congressman, was treated similarly because she strongly objected to prejudice against Jews.
In my case, the proposition of reproach was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, European ironically similar issues and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
On Friday, the announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East said that “we want the meetings to understand no outside and to be effective. ”
During my eight - year career as a member of the working party, Friday meetings have been the most often.
Sadly, it is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of “milder and better ” politics has been forgotten if it ever began.
It has been more and more evident that different opinions have not passed in the Working Party and that all opinions are judged according to whether the leaders of the group consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when co-workers who I once thought had similar political views to me began to expect me to take a complete reversal and support opinions that I had never agreed before, whether about national security or a common EU market area.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's a lot of disgrace on the social media calling after my disfellowshipping, central politics denying, and telling me that I shouldn't be in the Working Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, where most comments I get to myself are usually political.
I admire the professionality and firmness of those who suffer the calamity of sexual or prejudiced offenses every day but never retreat.
One of the greatest disappointments in this political period is the natural nature of attacks and insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Workers Group should support a tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer tolerant of churches, and every distrust supposition or change in the rules of choice becomes increasingly narrower.
For the past two years, I have been advised not to be too loud, and I would be “all right. ”
But I did not decide to take part in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Working Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of thatcher’s government, who left my schoolroom in depression, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether in the city government or in the council.
I've never hidden my political views, neither have I in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy views and where I disagree with the current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country is heading for Brexit, which will harm our home, company and public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Working Party.
But my only message I would like to send from me is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those who are within my district, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threats of apostasy or political disfellowshipment will prevent me from doing what I believe to be for the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchdowns may have distorted the final result something, but there is no doubt that Ayr got the victory in this acute game of the day in Tennent's Premiership Division.
They are now at the top of the list and one of the ten teams that are still undefeated.
Finally, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made the locals more victorious, and Peter Murchie had the full right to be happy.
“ We have faced severe opposition in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy, ” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “Air deserves commendation, they made better use of their opportunities than we did, ”
Mark Grant Anderson crossed Ayr in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned the search, but a yellow card on the Scottish Commander, who was allowed to play the game with Warriors, enabled Melrose to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot reached the touch mark.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayr with a hell before he scored with a kick just before half-play and then touched the mark and got Ayr over 17-5 in half.
However, Melrose began a later half - game of strength and touched Patrick Anderson’s mark, after Baggot turned the search back, to five points.
Then a long break had to be made to sustain serious injuries at Ruaridh Knott, who had to carry a playground, and after that, Ayr continued to increase his leadership with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the search.
Ayr’s leader, Blair Macpherson, then got the yellow card, and Melrose reused himself to be a man with a touch mark from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a harder appeal.
However, the locals came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for accepting Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored the touch mark behind the Ayr response, after an extra challenge.
Climo turned the search back, as he did again immediately after the start, after Kyle Rowe caught the kick of David Amrstrong from the Vitae and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the fifth touchdown of the team.
Stars the Still Game plays ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game shows, seems ready to move over to a restaurant after discovering that he was the manager of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC shows that he writes and plays along with his old partner from the entertainment business, Creg Hemphil.
The double has announced that the future nineth series will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan has plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to say anything about the story, but Scottish Sun's source suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the "living restaurant company" of Glasgow City.
"The sea is ours: the coastal land of Bolivia hopes that the court will open a way back to the Pacific
Marines are guarding the Navy headquarters of La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flags.
Navy stations from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon River are marked with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
On the other hand, in the 19th - century, all of the landmarked Bolivia reminder of the coastline lost in Chile in bloody conflicts, still in fresh memory, along with the desire to sail again through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Hague on October 1, after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia has the power, the unity, and the conductlessness, and, of course, awaits the decision with a positive mind, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many residents of Bolivia will monitor the international court’s decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will decide Bolivia in favour of their obligation to give Bolivia access after decades of difficult discussions.
The decision on Monday is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indians, who will be in a controversial battle for the next year's re-election.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised late in August.
However, some analysts believe that Bolivia’s decision was unlikely, and that it would not change much if he did.
The Court of Justice, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to give land from Chile, and has decided that the decision will not affect the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the Court’s decision comes only six months after the final talks were heard indicates that “the matter had not been complicated, ” said Paz Sárate, a international expert.
It is also possible that over the past four years, rather than Bolivia, has been a cause for the country’s reversal.
“ The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea, ” said Zárate.
Morale’s verbal speech has diminished all goodwill from Chile, believed she.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk sometime, but it will be extremely difficult after that.
Since 1962, the two countries have not shared messengers.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the Hague country, rejected the idea that the decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile ” and an opportunity to“ put an end to a controversy that reaches 139 years back in time, both countries to benefit, ” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using this issue as a political chicken.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
“ The incision is an opportunity to see that we have to recover from the past. ”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear decommissioning unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Minister of North Korea says the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri gave his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His remarks now come when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, seems to be starting again on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea.
Ri says that it is “drama ” to believe that continuing business prayers and protests against the declaration of the end of Korea’s war will ever crush North Korea.
Washington doesn't want to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes a clear action to take down his nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, president of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there is great doubt that Pyongyang is serious about taking down arms that the country is likely to view as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion shows in Paris present the latest line of big headswear that will come to the fashion stores near you
If you want to enlarge your hat library or be completely hidden from the sun, you don't have to search any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed many strange hats in their oversize for their SS19 line in the fashion scene that fascinated the jetfly in the fashion week in Paris.
In the summer of Instagram, many images of very unending cats have been published, and these designers have shown their new creations in fashion.
The main work of Valentino was a large light - brown hat with large tables that were like feathers and covered the heads of the models.
Of other parts of oversized size, watermelons were shown to be placed with jewels, guinea hats, and even pineapples, but these are not designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced many strange masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had clad lips and were rather like Hannibal Lecter than high - fashioned.
One mask was like a diving device with a respiratory pipe and glasses, while others were like melting ice cream in a bread form.
If you want to be a toll in your fashion, you're lucky.
fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be placed in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats come on the heels of “La Bomba, ” a straw hat with over 60cm large barrels that have decorated a head from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion mark on the back of the very unhanded hat that was seen on all the social media was inspired by another large component that appeared in the fashion scene — a beach bag of straw, almost as large as the swimled model that wore it.
The orange strata, with a straw and white leather handle, was the main part of the La Riviera SS10 fataline Jacquemus on the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, the styleist of the famous people, said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and coastal bags appear in the fashion stores for the next summer — where the designer has caused such a great impact, it should be difficult to ignore requests for oversized items. ”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for the world’s citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding results of their students, and it has continued in 2018 with new, magnificent test results, which are still strengthened by individual and group ambitions in sports, arts, music, and other societies.
These schools have up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (Schoss private school council, SCIS) in defense for them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim at preparing their students for further continuing studies, the career they have chosen, and their position as world citizens.
As a class class that can compile and teach from specially designed programs, we see that new languages continue to be popular in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it affects his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it touches his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can not just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The test results of this year show that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest percentages of students who make personal studies.
68 percent of students who learned foreign languages were acquainted with A.
The data collected from 74 schools within SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the A fine in mandarin, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent French learners, and 63 percent Spanish learners also received the A grade.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
At the moment, languages, as a selection, are placed in the same place as scientific studies (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in personal school and elsewhere.
The survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that, for the reasons given by employers that it was difficult to recruit jobs, 17% was because people with language skills were in shortages.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future work.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a global world.
No matter what career people choose, they will have a real precedent in the future if they learn another language, which is the knowledge that lasts their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multi - weighted person the forefront of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in over 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to keep conversations, and French was the only language spoken by two - letter percent, or 15 percent.
Hence, it is important for children today to invest immediately in language teaching.
A multitude, especially in newly-market countries, will give children a better opportunity to find important jobs.
In Scotland, schools differ from one language to another.
A number of schools will focus on classical new languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for Britain when viewed until 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest is, he will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools undertake to offer a study environment that will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to achieve, no matter what the future will bring.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in the global business environment, languages remain necessary for the future of the country, and they must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be viewed as “international skills in communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity and superiority for young Scotland.
Il faut the bee le faire.
John Edwards, Chairman of the Scottish Private School Council
LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The waiting is about to end for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Luke Walton, Lakers Coach, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening season against Denver Nuggets, San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
“ It will be longer than one minute and shorter than 48, ” said Walton on Laker’s public website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After exercising earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games of Laker’s program before the start of the season.
“ During this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare, ” he said.
Timeout for Trump election meetings in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop in friendly places, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election of a new Supreme Court Judge has been suspended, Trumpad aims to build up support for the next middle-term surveys, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Senate when voting in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin at 7:00 to East Coast Time tonight, Saturday, September 29th, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below through direct broadcasting on YouTube.
Trump is likely referring to Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge, where there was tension for the accusations of sexual repression, the vote of the Senate to confirm him as the judge was suspended for up to a week while the FBI is investigating the accusations.
But the main goal of Trump’s meetings is to help the Republicans get better, but they are waiting for difficult elections in November.
Therefore, the message from Trump’s election campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, aim “to fill the volunteers and supporters of enthusiasm when the Republicans try to protect and increase the majority of them in the Senate and Congress, ” according to Reuters news office.
“ The government of the Senate is so necessary for the President’s plan that he will travel to as many states as possible now that a busy campaign period begins, ” said an unappointed spokesman from Trump’s campaign at Reuter’s news office.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and that Pittsburgh media report him, ” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's meeting will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, but he won with over 40 percent differences in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to help Patrick Morrissey, the candidate of the Republic of West Virginia to the Senate, but he's in the lower part of the polls.
“ It is not good for Morrissey to know that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity, ” said Simon Haeder, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuter’s newsletter.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows its willingness to keep the hope alive for the individual competition on Sunday
After three one - sided circles, the four - game that was the afternoon of Saturday could be exactly what was needed in this race for the Ryder cup.
Successful fluctuations are a sport concept that has been invented and truly believed by players, and never more than in the race like this.
Where would they say that success is now?
“They had six points ahead, and now there are four points, so the success lies rather on our side now, I guess, ” said Jordan Spieth when he started in the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has the forefront, four stages ahead, with 12 more at stake.
As Spieth said, the Americans believe that they have a little wind in their sails, and they can be hopeful over many, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and who received three points out of four.
Spieth has played greatly delicately and leads by his example.
As the ring drew, the shouts of good news increased, and he put down an important puddle to take all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points below after two games.
His puppet, who secured their victory at the 15th hole, shouted like a joyful shout, of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American team still has a victory hope.
"You just have to dive deep and think about your own game," said Speth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to work in points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder cup.
This strange but fascinating European couple has won four games of four and cannot do anything wrong.
“ Moliwood ” was the only couple who had a bad afternoon on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid wrecking on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the nine-hole field on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audiences clearly shows that they are the couple that have to conquer on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, when the sun is seated over the Le Golf National Field.
The best option would be for both of us to do so at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson took Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four in the morning, playing with Alex Noren.
The Spanish and the Swedes were buried in a hole that they never managed to scratch themselves out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the four games are so exciting to watch close to the couple’s communications, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how a program can change in one quarter.
Europe has played better so far and has a considerable precedent before the end of the day, but this four - game race also showed that the American team has the willingness to fight that some had doubted, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 leaders for the final day of the race for the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good precedent for the final day of the Cup Ryder after a fourball and the fourth of Saturday, with the forefront of 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, starvioke, led the attack with two victories over the troubled Tiger Woods, and had four points at the Le Golf National Field.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, who would like to regain the prize cup that it lost at the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the U.S. team in the four - ball game of the morning and won 3-1.
The United States showed greater opposition in the four games and won two games but did not win the score.
Jim Furych's team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who wins four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname “Molliwood” after a marvelous weekend, are only one pair who wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they showed a great strength and defeated Woods and the U.S. newcomer Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius occasionally, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four games and four games and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resuspended for the morning's four-ball game, returned to her partner, Henrik Stenson in the four-games, and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, which are in the first and third seats of the world's best golfers.
However, Europe did not fully benefit on this mild and dazzling day southwest of Paris.
Three-time golf winners, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They worked with difficulties 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four-ball games and came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the four games after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Cup Ryder has a team won four points at the beginning of an individual race, although the Furyx team only needed a drawer to continue the cup.
However, after being the second - best for two days, they seem to be overwhelmed by a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says one-sided deployment “impossible” without confidence
On Saturday, the U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United States that the continuing business prayers were only on their distrust to the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons one-sided under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho, at the UN General Annual Assembly, stated that North Korea had undertaken “significant efforts to show goodwill ” in recent years, such as by halting nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear test area, and promising to put an end to the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“ On the other hand, ” he said, “we have not seen any similar reaction from the United States. ”
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the safety of our country, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons one-sided first. ”
Although Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “stage division” approach to nuclear decomposition, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed special in that he did not deny one-sided nuclear decomposition purely as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to the joint declaration of Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work on the “nuclear nuclear decommissioning of the Korean Gulf, ” and Trump promised to ensure the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has sought a solution to make a formal end to the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also stood up to the call to relax a stringent restrictions on trade against North Korea.
“ The United States demands that “a nuclear decommissioning take place first, ” and increases pressure by using a commercial prayer to achieve its own, and even protests the declaration of ending the war, ” said Ri.
“ Only fantasies of people know nothing about us to think that business prayer can break our knees.
But the problem is that continuing business prayer increases our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, the U.S. leader of the United States, earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea in the last five months, and added: “If the member of this nuclear decommissioning issue would be South Korea instead of the United States, this position in the case of nuclear decommissioning on the Korean coast. ”
In spite of this, the speech by Ri was very different from his speech last year when he said in the United Nations General Assembly that it would be inevitable to direct missiles from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after “the Devil’s President ” Trump called Kim a“ fireman ” for a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened to “finish ” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim of the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much work was still left and that business prayers had to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timeline for this, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo of the UN Security Council on Thursday said: “The trade request of the Security Council must continue until complete nuclear decommissioning has taken place and it has been confirmed. ”
The Security Council agreed to increase the business petition in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to close funding for the nuclear and missile programmes of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline at the General Assembly and said afterward that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making “criminal demands. ”
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to deploy missiles and nuclear stations if the United States took action “correspondingly. ”
He said that Kim told him that the “corresponding actions ” he was looking for were guarantees for security that Trump promised in Singapore and actions towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a sufficient resting course
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep to try to resist the growing tendency of students to stay awake and learn all night by means of caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little or nothing when it comes to the basics of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of somnolence at Harvard Medical School and expert at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes that it sees the first of its kind in the United States.
He was given the idea of conducting the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep on the ability to study.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked: “Why am I told this first now, in my last year? ”
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep that surprised me," he said to Telegraph.
The first time this year’s study explains to the students the basics of how good sleeping habits help study and performance in sports and even promote general well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the School Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after learning that students were very sleepless over the week.
The course is an hour long and involves various interactive projects.
In one section, there is a picture of a room in the home, where students click on a cup of coffee, window curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports performance can worsen with the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a good routine for sleeping.
In another section, the participants are told how long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interacting symbols then encourages the participants to think about their daily habits.
“ We know this will not change the behavior of students right away.
But we feel that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes, ” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that accommodates those who stay awake and learn all night is still present, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep shortages were growing problems.
The assurance of sufficient sleep of good quality should be “secret weapon ” students to resist stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said, even to avoid fatigue, because the brain’s lack of sleep increases its demand for food so that the body is constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old student in chemical and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler to compile the course, who sat one of the professor’s couriers last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that his course opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students in school.
He hopes that the next step will have to ask all master students to finish a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting the alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to awaken them, and consider the harmful effects of blue light that electronic screens and LED lights produce, which can confuse the internal clock and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark of Menga shoots Gerrard's men down
Rangers were still in trouble when Steven Gerrard's split team had to accept 1-0 losses at Livingston, after the mark of Dolly Menga.
The team of Ibrox wanted to win his first victory after his victory at St. Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt gave Gerrard's team only another loss in his 18 games as manager.
The polluter scored seven minutes before half-game and the Rangers team seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to recover.
Rangers now fall into the sixth place, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only behind Hibernian in target differences.
Rangers could have more trouble after the liner Calum Spence had to be treated for head injury after some object was thrown in it from the halfway of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that swept Ayr away and made a break in the Betfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, maintained the same Livi 11 setup that reached a stage of Heart’s last week, and he would have been pleased with how his well - trained men chose the opposition.
Rangers might have had the ball more, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls that it reached.
They should have scored only two minutes after the playoff when the first shipment from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allans McGregors, but he missed.
A long extra challenge from Keaghan Jacobs then ended with Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defense partner, shot past the remote bar.
Rangers took control of the game again but seemed to live in hope rather than believe in their game in the final third of the game.
Certainly Alfredo Morales felt that he should have gotten a hell after a quarter of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but the judge Steven Thomson rejected the Columbusman’s call.
Rangers only achieved two shots in the first half, but Liam Kelly, the former target Ibrox, did not have to do much to protect bald from Lassana Coulibaly and easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although an opportunity from Livi in the 34th minute had occurred despite the other team’s control, no one can deny that they deserved it, but only because of their endurance.
Rangers failed again to do anything from a long extra back from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was quiet and chose to send to Menga, which then easily challenged.
Gerrard took action in half-play and sent Ryan Kent into the place of Coulibaly, and the exchanges had effect almost immediately when the backguard came in Morelos, but Kelly quickly responded and ran forward to closing the shot.
However, Livingston continued to trick the guests to play exactly the kind of game they enjoy playing and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long transmission after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded its lead in the final minutes, but McGregor did well to deny Jacob's opportunity before Lithgow ran from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Rangers' assistant, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell together, but Thomson rejected it again.
Calendar: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a page from our calendar “Soundy Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and AUSTRIA... this is the day that future physicist John Wilhelm “Hans ” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to study and measure radioactivity, and this invention eventually led to a device called Geiger.
The Geiger meter has been a permanent place in the scientific world since then, but was also popular in the pop culture, for example in the 1950 movie “Bells of Coronado, ” with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: “What the hell is this? ”
Rogers: “This is Geiger, used to find radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put these hearing aids on you, you can hear the effects of the atoms because of radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: “It’s really breaking now! ”
His “Geiger ” died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
Treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory
Then they can ‘se’ proteins common in many cancer cells and then be injected back into the patient.
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months; the vaccine teaches immune cells to recognize dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them to a laboratory so that they can “se” a protein called HER2 and found in many types of cancer; then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States Cancer Institute of Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that the vaccine is very effective. ”
HER2 “stops various types of cancer, ” including breast cancer, ovarian, lung, and colon, said professor Berzofsky.
Similar methods in which immune cells are taken from patients and which “feel” to attack cancer cells have been effective in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.

It didn't end well
Baulat was at Kanye West in the Saturday Night Live studio, following a long - vocal talk, commending President Donald Trump of the United States and said that he would volunteer for presidentship in 2020.
After delivering the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he carried Make America Great der hat, he spoke long against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“ I have spoken so often to white people who say, “How can you like Trump, he is a racial threatator? ”
If I was concerned about racial hatred, I would be moved from the United States for a long time, ” he said.
SNL started the stage with a chariot where Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judgment Committee for Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual abuse.
Although the long end of West was not sent out, the recording of it was placed on social media by Chris Rock’s comedian.
I don't know if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
West also complained to the audience that he had received bad backstage reception for his hat - choosing.
“ I was ridiculed backward.
They said to me: “Do not go up into the field with this cap. ”
They mocked me!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to the news from Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Would you like to see the deep hole ” and said that he would put on his superhero garment,“ because that means that you cannot order me to do things; do you want the world to make progress?
Try love."
According to Variety, his talks were attended by at least two spectators, and SNL’s actors seemed ashamed, and one attendant said to the newspaper: “There was stone silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, Chairman of the Conservative Party TPUSA, on Twitter: “To one of the most courageous souls: THANK TO RESPONSIBLE MOVE. ”
But on Twitter, chat program manager Karen Hunter said that West was simply being “he himself, and it’s just wonderful. ”
“ But I didn’t choose to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing, or supporting his “list ”) that I feel supports and spreads my harmful society’s ideology.
He's free.
It's us, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now “the creature that was previously known as Kanye West. ”
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the Promise of Music, Prince, who changed his name to a sign and later called himself the artist formerly known as Prince.
Prosecute for a murder attempt after a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45 - year - old man has been accused of a murder attempt after being stabbed to a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to be in the courtroom in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticizes toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventure shows from the HBO, the Crown Games.
The 31 - year - old player, however, has criticized the situation of the male hero and says that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that “something went wrong ” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his accomplice from the Crown Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “a strong opinion ” on how to deal with this issue.
"Perfectly, I think at the moment - what's wrong with manhood?"
“ What have we taught men in their upbringing, about the problems we see now? ”
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in poisonous manhood because of a very manly person on television.
He continued: “What is born with birth, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel like they must be made by a man?
I think it's one of the most important questions of the time-- how do we do this?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong with young men."
He also acknowledged during the interview that he would not play any other Crunicity shows after the series was similar to the next summer and said that he had received “enough of battlefields and horses. ”
From November onward, Kit will play a reproducer of True West, a picture of Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about playing in the Crown Games was to meet his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these scenes, so they gave me some of my future family and my life after that, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's lover, who Kit played in these Emmy prize shows.
The couple married in June 2018, in the country of Lesli’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new infectious diseases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of nationals infected with HIV or AIDS.
The health authorities say that more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Some 40,000 new infections were reported only during the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections were transmitted by sex, which is a change from what was before.
Earlier, the HIV virus spread rapidly to some parts of China because of transfusions of infected blood.
On the other hand, the number of people infected with the HIV virus in this way has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan County.
However, the number of HIV-infected or AIDS-infected has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
Sex-induced HIV infection is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but, according to LGBT, there is still much discrimination against the people of LGBT.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many contaminations result from inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, China’s Government has promised everyone access to HIV drugs as part of the plan to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the fact that a staff member leaked data from the Senate members of the Republic, criticizes “hazardous lies ” and“ conspiracy teachings ”
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a congressman denied the accusation that one of her employees had published personal information on their Wikipedia websites for three Senate Senators of the Republic.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that these claims came from “superior ” extremists and websites.
“ Liar, lies, and other pathetic lies, ” said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The information published contained, according to the addresses and numbers of the American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday from an unknown party at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate at Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge, for the accusation of sexual injustice.
The play came after the three Senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Containing pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP numbers identifying the source of the information were connected to the office of Waters and published information about one of her employees, according to Capitol Hill information.
“ This unreasonable accusation is absolutely wrong and pure lie, ” continued Waters.
“ My executive — whoever personal information and security is now at risk because of these wrong accusations — was in no way responsible for this information leakage.
This unreasonable accusation is completely false and pure lie."
Water’s statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ara Fleischer, former White House News Officer.
“This denial is full of anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“ This suggests that she has no mood to sit in a congress.
When a person is accused without reason, he must not react with wrath.
There is no opposition.
Do not ask about the reasons for the accused person.
It has to be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of a judge Kavanaugh, whom critics said seemed too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Professional Republican against Waters, also said his view on Twitter.
“ If the truth is true, ” he shook.
In his statement, Waters stated that her office had “knowed these false allegations to the appropriate authorities and police officers.
“ We will ensure that the guilty are found, ” she continued, “and that they will be brought to justice for all the destructive and dangerous things that are dangerous to all my employees. ”
Video criticism for Johnny English Strikes again - a spynammite with Rowan Atkinson proves powerless
Nowadays it has become customary to look for Brexit references in all new pictures where Britain is involved, and it seems to apply in this resuscitation of the Johnny English comedy order - which started in 2003 with the image Johnny English and just woke back to life in 2011 with the image Johnny English Reborn.
Will this perhaps satira about how clearly miserable we are as a new export opportunity for the country?
Whether or not, Johnny English has been renewed for the second time — his name, above all, shows that he is designed for displays in other than English - speaking countries.
Of course, he is the intelligent secret servicer who pretends to have thrilling charms, but is a little bit of a mix of Clouseau, a dass of Mr Bean, and a little draught of the man who played one note for the Chariots of Fire song at the opening party of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also originally based on the traveler and the mysterious citizen that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television advertisements, where he left everything behind in a mess.
There's one or two fine points in this latest Johnny English picture.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walk to a helicopter clothed with a middle-age brine, and the helicopter blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his jokes, but the humor seems rather powerful and strangely superficial, especially now that “severe ” movies such as James Bond and Mission Impossible images also offer cautious jokes.
The joke seems more intended for children than for adults, and I felt that the adventures Johnny English had not been as imaginative and focused as the silent jokes of Atkinson in Mr Beans.
The perpetual prerequisite of the picture now is that Britain is in great trouble.
A computer hacker has broken into the UK's secret spy network and identified the identity of all British spys, to a great deal for the spy that's on the watch - but unfortunately Kevin Eldon is in too little role.
This is the final line for the Prime Minister who is proud and controversial and already in great difficulty because of enormous political impopulation: Emma Thompson is doing his best with his role as a person to remind of Theresu May, but the manuscript is not much for it.
Her counselors tell her that all active spys are in danger and that she must find someone who had already sat down.
And there is Johnny English himself, now the principal of some great school, but also provides secret lessons in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers to a spy school that reminds us of the film School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and meets there Bough, his former long-term partner, which Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in that energyful role Vicki Pepperdine does not fully reach to let his light shine.
The spynatry that messes up everything in her Majesty's service has now returned to the gear and meets the dangerous Opheliu Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is impressed by the magic of the charming billionaire in the technology sector, who claims to be able to solve the computer problem of Britain: it is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their failure missions: they light up a fine French restaurant occupied as servants, they cause bad as they smuggle themselves in the luxury rock of Volta, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to study the interior of the house of Volta.
There is nothing left to save in this final point, but the picture is strong and powerful, but the whole part of the child’s material is devoid of it.
Moderate material.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn't help but think: Can British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
The working group refuses to prepare a four-day work week plan for the British, with the same salary as five days ago.
The team of workers, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but will be paid for five.
According to the group, the company’s heads want to make savings generated from the revolution into artificial intelligence, and to allow employees to benefit from one extra day.
In that case, staff may spend three days of weekends without lowering their wages.
Sources say that the idea would be “adjusted” to the group’s economic programme and its approach to improving workers’ interests.
The Trades Union Congress Working Party has supported the shortening of the week for four days, which led workers to take advantage of economic changes.
At Sunday Times, a source from the upper sections of the Workers Group said: “It is estimated that policy review will be reported by the end of the year.
“The change will not take place in one night, but four days of work week is a target that corresponds to the approach of the group to change the economy to workers and to the overall industry policy.”
The working group would not be the first group to support this idea, but the green group promised a four-day working week in its campaign in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported by the Workers as a whole.
A spokesman of the Workers Group said: “Four days of work are not on the class policy sheet, and the group is not considering the introduction. ”
John McDonnell, the business minister of the Defence Department, used the Working Party conference last week to describe his ideas of social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from “unknown managers ” and “profit organizations. ”
The shadow minister's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get all their shares back, since the government of the Workers' Group could “abstain” because of alleged injuries.
He has also confirmed the plans to place workers in the management committees and to create a common equity fund to give 10 percent of the assets of private companies to their staff, who could receive 500 pounds of income from them annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if the FBI investigation at Kavanaugh could get them to change their minds.
The FBI study of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a weekly delay in the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court, and raises the question whether its findings could get the Senate members of the Senate to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be held on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter in the “60 minutes” program of the Republican and Senate Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“ When the trial began, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After the accusations were presented, I called and asked, “Did you do this? ”
He was firm, firm, uncircumcised."
Graham’s vote, however, seems unchangeable.
“ I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and there was an incredible accusation to change it, ” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know that Brett firmly denied it, ” added Graham and addressed Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And not everyone she mentions could confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I can't see anything new will change."
What is the International Civil Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York, which is an annual musical event in which a series of superstars will appear and with a similarly effective policy; ending poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the International Civil Festival, and tens of thousands of people will travel to Central Park, not just to listen to musical items from Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to bring an end to severe poverty before 2030.
The International Civilian Festival, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project (Global Poverty Project), which is an international campaign organisation that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of fighters against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for the VIP tickets), the guests had to complete various tasks, or “actions”, such as doing volunteering, sending e-mail to one of the world’s leaders, calling or using other valid ways to help draw attention to their goals of ending poverty.
But how much has the festival been accomplished, now that there is 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with a free concert really a way to convince people to call for action, or is it just one so-called "click operation" - where people feel they do something that matters by signing a list of demands on the Internet or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 it has recorded more than 19 million “operations” from its supporters, calling for a number of different objectives.
It says that these actions helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to $35 billion that will affect lives over $2.25 billion before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications for its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or collected.
The group estimates that up to now the funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and managers in the United Kingdom who is working to “help children to enjoy themselves fully, ” and promised to give 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
“British government, sponsors, governments around the world, and international citizens like you, we can make the social injustice that malnutrition belongs to the past, ” said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition at London’s audience in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 calls were made for Britain to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children and will provide them with better nursing.
On a list of common questions on the group’s website, one question is: “Why do you think you can put an end to sore poverty? ”
Global citizens replied: “It will be a long and difficult task — sometimes we will fail constantly.
But, we will achieve our goal, just as movements fought for the rights of civilians and the abolition of race separation before us, because we are stronger together.
Among those of the events this year are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe, the event will be held in New York, and the presents are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a “stop ” to prevent Russian energy exports, says the Minister of Interior
“ If necessary, ” says the U.S. National Minister Ryan Zinke, “Danish Navy could use it to prevent its power from reaching the market in Russia, including the Middle East. ”
Zinke claimed that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially where the country works at the invitation of the legitimate government there, was awarded to explore a new market.
“I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy, as in Eastern Europe and its southern part, ” he should have said according to the sources.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and methods to oppose it.
“ The United States can use the Navy to ensure that seaways are open and to create obstacles, if necessary, to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market, ” he said.
Zinke addressed a visitor to the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called “the voice of the energy consumer ” in the United States.
He continued and compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said that she was more or less the same.
“ The economic choice for Iran and Russia is more and less exploiting energy and replacing it to others, ” he said, saying Russia has only one card in memory with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuel.
The declarations come as a result of Trump's management wishing to increase its exports of gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, official staff in Trump's regime, and including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to discontinue participation in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project of placing a new energy pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollars of Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline, which will double the transportability of the current pipe up to 110 billion metres, is only a economic project.
The Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply continued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“ I think we share the view that energy may not be a tool to apply pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the supplies, ” said the Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with the U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry, in Moscow, in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and with a double-sided agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“ I’m very uncomfortable with the fact that foreign states are involved in our energy sector, ” said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federal of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, Germany’s Chancellor, and Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously ” to volunteer for the presidential office in 2020, she says
On Saturday, Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said that after the middle - term investigations, she would “will consider serious. ”
Warren confirmed that she would consider volunteering for a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“ It is time for women to go to Washington and arrange our government, and then a woman needs to be a leader, ” said the report from The Hill.
“ After November 6, I will seriously consider making myself a president’s office. ”
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting and said: “He is taking the land on the wrong course.
“I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, ” she said.
Warren has been obsessed with his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Court Judge.
On Friday, Warren on Twitter said: “Of course, we must have the FBI investigate the matter before voting. ”
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warrens state do not think it should be available in 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of the “probable ” voters in Massachusetts said that the Senate Senator should not volunteer, according to a survey published by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent claimed to support her offer.
The survey showed more support for Deval Patrick, former governor, where 38 percent claimed to support his possible offer and 48 percent claimed to oppose it.
Among other popular Democrats discussed for possible presidential elections in 2020, Joe Biden, former Vice President, and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he was going to make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about the shock attack of Track Palin at Donald Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“My son is experiencing great difficulties after returning, I feel with other families who feel the impact of shock trauma and the spiritual wounds that our soldiers bring back home, ” she said to the audience at a election meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the Phil in the room, ” and said that her son and other war soldiers“ would come back just differently, they are harsh and wonder if there is any respect for what their associates in the military and the air forces and other military divisions have done for the land. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for attempting to prevent the announcement of domestic violence, and for arming under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a police officer in Wasilla.
18 states and Washington D.C. support a challenge against a new refugee policy.
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge against the United States' new policy, which denies victims who flee refugees or domestic violence.
Officials of the 18 states and the city filed a legal report on Friday in Washington to support a refugee seeker who protests the policy, according to the NBC News report.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. the prosecutor of the American Civil Liberties Union has not been released.
She said that her spouse “and his violent sons, who were walking members, ” used violence, but the American government officials rejected her application for shelter on July 20.
They put her in custody in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems of domestic violence are increasing, and the number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum seeker policy revokes a decision issued by the importers' appeal committee in 2014 to allow inadvertent immigrants who escaped domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a Friday prosecutor Karl Racine, Washington, stated that the new policy “was overlooking decades of federal and international laws. ”
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule, ” said the Court Report.
In the report, lawyers further stated that the policy of denying immigrant entry would be damaging to the economy of the United States, claiming that immigrants were more likely to set up companies and “have an important labour force. ”
Jeff Sessions, a state prosecutor, ordered immigrant judges to stop giving refuge to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“ Those who leave their homeland because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political examination may apply for asylum, ” said the session in its announcement on June 11th.
Hedge troops were never meant to solve all problems, not even all serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Despairing rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, doubled
Conditions become more and more difficult for survivors.
“ There is great tension in the air, ” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, who comforted her sick son in the relief center of Palu.
“ Infectious cars are bringing bodies here all the time.
There's little clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes and searching in their waterproof possessions to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals are overwhelmed and damaged after the earthquake of 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke their back and shoulder, were outside the Pala military hospital, where patients were welcomed outside because of continued strong post-quakes.
His tears filled his eyes when he told him how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up to the walls, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“ I heard my wife cry for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “a persecution ” by“ propaganda advertising ”
A week after the official newspaper in China published a four - page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper to discuss the mutual advantages of trade between the two countries, the U.S. Ambassador of China Beijing accused the U.S. media to distribute propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, spoke last Wednesday about the advertising of the Chinese newspaper Des Moines Register, which is the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to intervene in the United States Congress on November 6, China denies this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to be involved in the United States Congress marked what official American representatives told Reuters newsletter that there was a new stage in a growing campaign from Washington to apply China’s pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote business, Peking and Washington are in constant business war, with new customs on import goods from both countries.
Chinese and American experts say that in early business war China’s vengeances were designed to harm foreigners in states such as Iowa, who supported the Trumps Republican team.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador in China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, who is moving a lot of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
Branstad, in his Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register, stated that “China was now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free media. ”
“ By spreading its propaganda, China’s government is taking advantage of the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and our free media by publishing costly advertising in the Des Moines Register magazine, ” Branstad said in his article.
“ On the other hand, ” he wrote, “few protestants can be found in newspaper shops on the streets of Beijing, and no real reflection can be found on the different views that Chinese might have on the worrying economic policy of China, where the media are trapped under the Chinese Communist party. ”
He added that “one of the largest newsletters in China did not get away with the offer to publish ” his article, but he did not say which magazine it was.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female voters distract them for the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned about negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid - period surveys, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge, who has been accused of sexual harassment.
There have been very strong feelings around this issue, and most Republicans have already officially shown that they wanted to start voting.
“ These things cannot be backed up, ” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the University of Maxwell at Syracuse, at The Hill, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that in the last minute of an investigation by the FBI, Jeff Flake, Senate Senator of the Arizona Republic, would be able to calm the angry voters.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, and not in November, ” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a supervisor and a spokesman for the free - tempered MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, the Protestants sang “November approaching! ” when they protested the hallways of the Senate when, in spite of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic, the Republicans who were in charge of the ruling committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh’s nomination.
“ The interest and enthusiasm of voters will go out of power, ” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, on the news website.
“ People will say that the interest has already been great, and that is true.
But he could be bigger, especially for female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who don't like the president, but rarely vote."
If the Republicans pressed to confirm Kavanaugh, even for the witness of Ford, she described her accusations of sexual resentment.
“ This has become a big mess for the Republican party, ” said Michael Still, former member of the National Committee of the Republic of the Republic, early last week, according to NBC News.
“The issue is not only about the committee’s vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, but also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they have treated it, ” said Guy Cecil, President of the United States Priorities, a group helping to vote Democrats, at the news station.
However, the Americans seem to disagree on the basis of the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and the small majority support the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents probably believed or probably believed the Ford testimony, while 35 percent claimed to believe in Kavanaugh's probably or probably witness.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lied to their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the request from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the accusations that Ford presented and from at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, according to a Guardian report.
The Ford swore to witness before the Senate Committee last week, saying that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh carried his genitals in front of her when they were both at a party as a student at Yale University in the 1980 ’ s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to set up a scepter company to fight against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the myth of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on a solid, open site of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access what information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “world dominion. ”
“We have to do this now, ” he said about the scepter company.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
There can be a list of contacts, to-do lists, calendars, music collections and other personal and work-related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “a personal election by using data. ”
According to John Bruce, director of the company, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security facility purchased by IBM, several programmers hired as contractors to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technological developers around the world could create their own independent programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not going to talk to “Facebook and Google about whether to start a complete change that would put their current business model on the head in one night.
“ We don’t ask for permission. ”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday in Media that “Inrupt had the objective of creating energy in business and ecosystems that help protect the honesty and quality of the new solid web. ”
Berners-Lee revolved the network in 1994 when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an effective voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he starts Inrupt.
“ I am optimistic for the next period of the Internet, ” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Viktorian Cross’s Priest and Handkeeper of the First World War honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victoria Cross during the first world war, a soldier who has been welcomed in his hometown 100 years later.
Reverend Bernard Vann, a military superintendent, received the cross on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
On the other hand, a sniper killed him four days later, and he was never told that he had received the highest vow of the British army.
His two grandsons exposed a memorial about him during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
His grandson, Michael Vann, said that it was “wonderful symbolic ” that the memorial was exposed exactly 100 years from his grandfather’s accomplishment.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel “through a very thick fog and under severe gun - and - gun shooting. ”
Later, he ran to the fireline, and with “great courage, ” he led the line forward before attacking a cannon one of his teams and defeating three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, only a month before the war ended, a superintendent was killed by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather’s heroic heroes were “what I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a flower crane after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was “a great honor to participate in the parade, ” adding that“ the heroic deeds are shown with the support that so many show. ”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of seeing Gurru pig.
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see overfull Bellator 206, just to be denied to see the main event.
The program included 13 battles from San Jose, six of them in the main record, and they were displayed in direct broadcasting all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British audiences were surprised when the broadcast changed to Gurru pig.
Some were dissatisfied to have been awake all night to watch the battle.
One fan of Twitter described the switch to the child - subject as “any kind of sick joke. ”
“ According to official rules, the subject was not fit for the audience at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s drugs, ” said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of the Marketing and Communication for Bellator, when asked for the broadcast.
"Gurry pigs, yes."
Scott Coker, director of Bellator said they'd review their time plans and take the viewers in Britain into account in the future.
“I think when I think of the reshow that we could probably solve this, ” said Coker.
“ But it is 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there, and we can’t solve this until Sunday to our time, which is a Monday for them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a number of text messages were sent forward and back, and not all were friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not so, it was an official problem.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We restrict the evening to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and passed out.
This is a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “difficulty ” because of sexual inclination
Tom Daley, an Olympic diptor, claims that he had experienced incapacity toward other people in his upbringing because of his sexual inclination, urged him to succeed.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different from others ” until he went to high school. ”
In the radio program Desert Island Discs on Radio Four Channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope. ”
He also said that his parental role reduced his interest in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the ordinary participant, has taken a few months off because of sickness.
In the first stage of Laverne, Daley said that he felt that he was “a lesser man ” than everyone else when he was a child because“ it was not agreed in society to like both boys and girls. ”
“ Until today, ” he said, “they feel that I am less than you, giving me the strength and strength to succeed, ” he said.
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint any at the end of his sexuality.
The double Olympic Bronze Sea has been a major supporter of LGBT and has used its participation in the Commonwealth games in Australia to call on other nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he was being heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The world champion three times said that falling in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he first met in 2013, “was surprised. ”
Daley married the 20 - year - old Oscar, who said that the age difference had never been a problem.
“ When a man goes through so much when he is young, ” but he participated in his first Olympic game when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later, he said that it was difficult to find an equal person who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his “all the opinions of his life ” had gone down.
“ If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold prize, ” he said.
“ You know, it's more important than a gold prize in the Olympic Games.
Robbie is my Olympic Gold Prize."
After diagnosing brain cancer, his son is baptized in the head of his father Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years old.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he had asked was if they had received their tickets before London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“ I couldn’t say to him that he would not live long enough to sit in the front row, ” he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing, ” he said, “and it was not until his breath stopped, and he was allowed to admit that I finally acknowledged that he was not unconquerable. ”
The next year, Daley competed in the Olympic Games in 2012 and won a bronze prize.
“ I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, dipping in front of the audience at the Olympic Games, ” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - who had inspired him for the Olympic Games and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 p.m. to British local time.
Mickelson in bad shape and put on the bench in the Ryder cup on Saturday.
U.S. Phil Mickelson will score on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder cup, but he needs to find his old beats again so that it doesn't have bad memories surrounded.
Mickelson, who plays the 12th prize, was placed on the class after the decision of Chief Jim Fury for the four-play and four-play races on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as it has been so often before the United States, the day is divided by the five - double champion between being a cheerleader and practicing the plays on the field in hopes of correcting his problems.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot directly with the bush, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf field, where long bumps often punish for bad shots.
And not only is the golf field a great challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, the winner of British Open, in the nineth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in the team and together they have won all their four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below when they take the first game of 12 single games, get a good start, Mickelson’s game could have made a difference.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“ He fully understood the role he had today, clapped my back, and embraced me, and said that he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Fury.
“ He has a lot of confidence.
He's in the celebrity palace, and he's been so great a remedy for the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I envisioned more, but that ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will hit the Nick Fallo score in the number of games played in the Ryder cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the process in the Ryder cup that has never reached exactly as high as other achievements on his file.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 equals, but Fury said that his presence had a certain vague effect on the people.
“ He's funny, he's ironic, he's funny, he's enjoying making fun of people, and it's great to have him in the team room, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed teasing him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjorn, European Head knows that great advances can quickly disappear
The European Chairman Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good precedent for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder cup can easily change into unpleasant experience.
The dance first played a game in Valderrama in 1997, where by side under the command of Senator Seve Ballesteros, the Americans had five points ahead, but it was just about to push out victory at the end with the least possible score gap, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a lot of precedence in Valderrama, we had a great precedent in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we worked, but only right so,” said Bjorn, which is seen here in the picture, after looking at the 2018 course of work on Friday and Saturday and reaching the forefront of 10-6 at the Le Golf National Field.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
We'll do our best tomorrow.
Let's go do everything right.
This is not finished until all the scores are on the table.
We have our goals and it's trying to win this cup, we focus on it.
I've always said this, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're very aware of our opposers in the other team - the best golfer in the world."
The bear was thrilled at how his players had done their best, adding: “I never get beyond myself in this.
Tomorrow will be completely different.
Tomorrow it is the individual’s performance that matters, and that’s another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you play one, all of you are tested as a golfer.
That's the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Björn, his adversary, Jim Furyk, will seek his players to do better in individual games than with partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this major change on the last day, but he was defeated with his team in Brookline, but he ended up losing when Europe performed “the miracle in Medinah. ”
“ I remember every fucking word, ” he asked how the leader Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, had encouraged his players before the last day.
“ We have 12 important games to play tomorrow, but you want to start fast as you did at Brookline and Medinah.
When the crawler is getting closer to building up, it causes great pressure on the games in the middle.
We ordered our players according to that and let them play as we think will work best tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the defense and to play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
“I chose these players in this order because I think they're covering all the way through, ” said Björn about his choice of players in the individual competition.
New German Army Ship Reseted
The newest ships of the German Navy should have been built in 2014 to replace old ships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until first of all next year because of broken systems and increasing costs, according to news in the region.
Based on the “Rheinland-Pfalz, ” the leadership of the new arms ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the records of the military spoke to Die Zeit magazine.
The ship was supposed to have been taken into account by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after delivering the project affected.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group that the Navy ordered in 2007 are supposed to replace the Bremen armed ships that have come to their ages.
They're supposed to be equipped with a stronger cannon, a lot of air-defense and ship-refractory missiles, and feline technologies such as reduced radar-infrared, and sound.
Other important features are longer use time - the latest ships should be able to be used for up to two years away from their home ports.
On the other hand, constant delays mean that these recent ships - which are said to enable Germany to demonstrate its strength at sea - are already obsolete when they are finally taken into account, says Die Zeit.
The F125 ship came into the news last year when the German army officially refused to take over the flight and returned it to the Blohm & Voss drop in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
There was little known about the reasons behind the divorce, but German media spoke of many women who were seriously “deficient in software and hardware, ” which made the ship useless if it was sent for a military mission.
Deficiencies in software were particularly important because ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by 120 crews, which are half less than those of the Bremen armed ships.
The ship was also found to be too heavy to reduce its performance and limit its capacity to improve it in the future.
The 7000 tons ship “Rheinland-Pfalz” is considered twice the weight of ships in a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the shortcomings in hardware, the cost of all the project - including the training of the crew - is starting to cause problems.
It is said to have reached EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), but initially it was EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems facing the latest ships are particularly important in view of the warning that German superiority is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Senate Defense Committee, acknowledged that the Navy was actually becoming “dissolved by working ships. ”
The deputy said that the problem was upset over time, for older ships were decommissioned, but no ships replaced them.
He regretted that none of the commands of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group could be taken into use by the Navy.
National Trust Nature Protection Association spys on the secret life of bats
A new study conducted in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the landscape when they hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will throw new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future natural protection operations.
The study conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland National Protection Association will monitor different types of bats in the Wester Ross Inverewe gardens.
Special recording devices will be installed at key locations across the area to monitor the behaviour of the bats over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also go on monitoring trips with handheld sensors.
Experts will record all the recordings to determine the frequency of the frequencies produced by the bats and what species do what.
A map of habitats and reports will then be published to produce a precise picture of their behaviour on a geographic scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS naval counselor, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of habitats are most important for the bats and how they are used for each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of farm management, e.g. by creating land and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
In the last century, in Scotland and throughout Britain, the number of bats has declined considerably.
They are at risk because of construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their habitats.
Windmills and lights can also cause risks, including fly paper, and certain chemical treatments on building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are much more helpful than their eyes when it comes to hunting a prey, because they are used to hunting at night.
They used highly developed electric engineering to find insects and objects on their flight.
NTS, responsible for maintaining more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land, takes bats very seriously.
In the organizations, ten specialists perform regular checks, nest examinations, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even established the first and one country of bats in Scotland at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats belong to Scotland.
David Thompson, the farmer’s supervisor, says he is a perfect area for them.
“The area here at Threave is great for bats, ” he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of grown trees, and plenty of good habitats.
But there is still a lot of ignorance about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before maintaining residences, since possible unintentional destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 female leaf flakes and young ones and destroy all bats in the area.
Bats are protected, and it is forbidden to kill them, harass or interrupt, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about bats, and we don’t know how well their species are doing. ”
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape when lawyers prepare an application against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has charged him with rape of “false news, ” saying that people want to“ draw attention to themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
In 2009, the proponent of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas.
He's been told to have paid her $37,000 afterwards to silence the incident, according to Der Spiegel's news on Friday.
Some hours after the accusations were published, 33 - year - old Ronaldo said in an Instagram Live video to 142 million of his followers that they were “false news. ”
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world champion five times to the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," the player added a smile.
Ronaldos’ lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have called “an unacceptable release of suspicions relating to privacy, ” according to Reuter’s newsletter.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would demand remedy for “injury of the same amount as the severity of the fraud, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her into the ancestry, according to documents submitted to Clark County County jurisdiction in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the injurious incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good man ” who fell into temptation because of“ one percent. ”
The papers claim that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex, but that they had both consent.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but finally agreed to settle outside the court because she was “deadly afraid of vengeance ” and was concerned about being“ disfellowshipped publicly. ”
She now says she wants to cancel the treaty, for she is still in shock after a suspected incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to have taken place, and this summer he went to the Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: Britain would “be sorry forever ” to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “repent forever ” if it lost its position as an international leader of the car manufacturers of Brexit, says Mr. Greg Clark.
He added that it was “anxiety” that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automobile manufacturer said that the effect would be delayed at the border if Brexit without a contract would cost a job.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were transferred to other European countries.
“My opinion is that if the United Kingdom gets out of the EU by the end of March, we will see production stations in our factory, ” said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about the exit of the EU without agreement on how to conduct inter-national transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that he will close his Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern lies in what car manufacturers say is a chain risk if Brexit becomes a reality without a contract.
Toyota's production lines are based on reception at the “last hour” where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from supply in both the UK and the EU for cars produced on orders.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without a contract on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border that the industry considers to lead to delays and shortcomings.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day store in its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the Chequers Theresu May programme for future relations with the EU “is aimed specifically at preventing these views at the border. ”
“ We need to have a deal, ” he said in a radio show at BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must continue with very effective means of return.
Toyota could not tell how long their production would stop, but he said that for a long time, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trustee of the factory, said that his colleagues were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
The government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU. ”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again, according to the White House.
The White House declared on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, State Attorney Advocate, could be “frested again by one week” is now the dispute for Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge, continues.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor investigating Russian elections, links between Trump and Russia's assistants, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the President.
For weeks, stories in Washington have reported whether Trump will run the U.S. Attorney General and thus jeopardise Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a recording device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of choosing the president by using the 25th additional paragraph of the Constitution.
Rosenstein refused these claims.
However, the last Monday, he visited the White House, where he heard that he was going to quit.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting with Trump was announced at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he was “mostly not ” to run Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed that he was not at the same time as the hearing of the judiciary committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who prosecuted him for sexual dependence, gave both witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI study on the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote of the Senate.
Sarah Sander, Trump's media agent, was on the show Fox News Sunday.
When asked to the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There is no date set for him, it could be this week, and I think it would be possible for him to be postponed for another week because of everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and it's always a pleasure for me to inform the media."
Some journalists disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10th.
The participant Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not due to dissatisfied TV newsmen, but she said: “I don’t disagree with the fact that they have a display. ”
She then indicated that a direct relationship between Trumps and the media would increase.
“ The president answers more questions in the media than any other president has done before, ” she said, without quoting the source: “We have reviewed these figures. ”
“ If the press has the opportunity to ask the United States President directly, it is much better than talking to me, ” said Sanders.
We're trying to do a lot of that, and you've seen us do a lot of it for the past few weeks, and it's gonna replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
The only meeting of the media with him is rare.
The president may have indicated why he was in New York this week when he showed unrestricted and strange behavior in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister for Health in Scotland writes to staff of the EU's health system because of concern for Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express their appreciation and wish that they continue to work after Brexit has passed through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter on less than six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the costs of application for employment licences for EU citizens working in the public service sector.
In her letter, Miss Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, talks between Britain and the EU have continued for the sake of a statement, and decisions are expected to be taken in the fall.
The British Government has also worked to prepare if a contract is not possible.
I know this must be a great time of uncertainty for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to make it clear again how much I value the work of all the staff, no matter the nationality.
Partners from the EU and elsewhere provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a headache
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after having had a head trauma in a 31-27 loss game against the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, according to a report from Mike Organ, Tennessean journalist.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State chief coach, told journalists that the trauma had occurred shortly before half-play.
“He came to the sideline and fell down there, ” Reed said.
Coachs and paramedics provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before being placed on the bar and carried out for further inspection.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris, a radioman of WSMV, Nashville, Tennesse, that Abercrombie had finished surgery at the Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there was “no information about the type or severity of the impact ” and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, a senior in school, plays its first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five capacities on Saturday before he left, which increased his total acceptance to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in Britain
Foreign purchasers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in Britain.
The operation will destroy the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased plunger fees will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The government estimates that it will raise 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy real estate in Britain. The extra money will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will report this today.
The operation will be considered an attempt to eradicate the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising more affordable accommodation and taxing high school members.
Individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK have to pay higher stamps, and the surplus will go into the government's action to help the homeless.
The increase - which is in addition to current plunger fees, including the increase of two years ago in extra homes and property purchases for rents - could be up to three percent.
The government estimates that the increase will produce up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built buildings are purchased by foreigners, resulting in an increase in prices and makes it difficult for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many wealthy areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become "drama towns" because of the number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in plunger fees to help more young people have their first home.
He accused large building firms of keeping property high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel the quota of households at the affordable price to fix the “household ” of Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has reported a number of respectable improvements in housing matters, including renting and the end of the excursion of rented houses without cause.
He also wants to give more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that I would devote myself to the restoration of the British dream during my first season — that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And it involves fixing our ruined real estate market.
The doors of Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for foreigners as for companies with foreign headquarters to buy homes and for hardworking British residents.
For many the dream of their own dwelling has become far too distant, and the shame of their homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland ”
Jack Ross, a coach of Sunderland, says that sometime it is his “primary goal ” to become a trainer of Scotland.
This 42-year-old Shot is now enjoying the challenge of blowing new lives in the North-East club, which now sits in the third place in the first division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after resuming St. Mirren to the Scottish Excellence Department in the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I got hurt on my knee, and it was done," said Ross in an interview with Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there is always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be available if I did well to train a department team."
The predecessors of Ross as coach Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of the Alloa Athletic Club said that he felt no fear of following in the footsteps of so famous names of such a large club, but he had previously rejected the training positions of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ As I am, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘ Can I get this club back to the elite department? ’
This club certainly belongs to the high school department because of his structure and situation," he said.
“ It’s not easy to get him there, but I’d probably only think of myself as a success here if I brought the club back up there. ”
Ross has only three years of experience as a trainer after a period as a coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a training team for Hearts.
He helped them Alloa to recover from falling down to the third division, and changed St. Mirren, who was about to fall over the division, to the championship next season.
Ross says he's more confident now than he ever was in his playtime at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
“ This was probably a real coincidence, ” he says during the period when he became a coach of Alloa.
“ I really believed that the training work was suitable for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I did well; I had good profits from it, and had good success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still experience stress and pressure from my job, but the training work seems just right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do, I've never felt better with myself in all my adult years."
The entire interview can be heard in the Sportsound show on Sunday, September 30, at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 to British local time.
The best time for beer is 5:30 a.m. on Saturdays, according to a survey.
The heat wave this summer has proved profitable for British bars in trouble, but the pressure on restaurant chains increased.
In July, the sale of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but the sale at restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA business advisor, who compiled the figures, said: “The future sunshine and unexpected success of England in the world cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to June month, when barsale increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants selling even less.
In June, sales fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants and worsened again in July.
Pops and bars, mainly for the sale of drinks, made the best job while restaurants went downward.
But not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and drink.
The sale of beverages in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent before the month, but the food sales decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM analyst, said: “These findings continue to be on the fluctuation we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social events or sports events are still the main factors for the sale of markets outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still in trouble, although a reduction in sales of up to 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful over the continued pressure caused by costs.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at the worse time for restaurants and only the time will show whether the temperature of temperatures, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
In July, the total growth in the sale of pops and restaurants, including newly opened locations, reflected 2.7 percent of the openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the surveillance company with sales in the British pub bar and restaurant store, collects and analyses data from 47 business groups, with a total of 9 billion pounds and is the industrial industry.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, up to 11 years of age, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the results of a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in the ‘performance of Insta’ page
News has increased concern about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students claim to have a “primary” account that they show to parents
One in five children, up to 11 years of age, make secret accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a significant increase in the ‘insta’ account, which refers to the Instagram website.
News has increased concern about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a pure “primary ” account to show parents, and also to keep secret accounts.
One mother, who fell down on her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website, found a youth who urged others to “ rape me. ”
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC (HMC) Senator showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two accounts, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, said: “It is worrying that so many youths are tempted to create an area on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the “voice of athletics ” of the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected by the Scottish Athletics Committee as an officer without authority at the annual general meeting of the government.
Doyle, the most successful free athlete of Scotland, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the Committee, said that the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from its great international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in sports communities in Scotland, Britain, and internationally, ” said Beattie, “and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money for it. ”
Doyle said: “I’m very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes, hoping that I can help to lead the sport forward in Scotland. ”
The American who worked among ananr 200 meters and 400 meters of the Olympic Games in Atlanta 1996, with a total of four Olympic gold, and now a regular guest at BBC, was paralyzed after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “Just a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Physicians said that only time would reveal whether I was recovering from them to how much.
This has been hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and do sports exercises today!
"Thank you for your encouragement."
A breast pump advertising comparing mothers with cows causes conflicts on the Internet
A company producing a breast pump is now referred to on the Internet because of advertising that brings lactating mothers to milked cows.
The company Elvie published a smart advertisement to mark the presentation of what is said to be “the first silent chest pumps in the world that can be carried out outside, ” the advertisement is inspired by musical videos and is intended to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cow a song with such words as: “Yes, I am milking, but you see no tail on me ” and “If you didn’t notice it, it’s not jugs, but my breasts. ”
The appendix continues: “Pumble, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk out of the joles. ”
On the other hand, the ad appeared on the Facebook website of the company has produced publicity on the Internet.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and has been reflexed by the audience, which many say is ghetting with the “cry ” of the milk industry.
“ Quite bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be calfful and bear to produce milk, unless the calves are taken away from them only a few days after they are born," said one reference.
Elvie breast pump fits comfortable in a breast-feeding holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another observer wrote: “It may be difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of order with time. ”
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman acknowledged that she was “amusing. ”
“ I think this is a very smart idea.
I'd have bought this if I still had a baby breast-feeding.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of my mouth.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one of the audience.
One said: “This is a fun ad that is directed to mothers who pump milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feels like “cook. ”
This is not an advertisement that commends or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the female group shows that they were all dancing with their breast pumps hidden in their breast hoods.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is that many women say they feel like cows when pumping milk out.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or pipes, and fits comfortable into a breast - bearer, which allows women to move, hold their child, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a co - owner and head of Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that she deserved a prominent presentation that would make a publicity.
By comparing women with cows, we wanted to direct the headlight to breast pumping and all the challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would give.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump's got the news.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children arranged a fashion show for the designer Martha Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a camp near the border of Texas
The number of immigrant children in custody has suddenly increased even though the number of people crossing the border monthly has remained quite the same, and part of the reason is that harsh speech and policy that Trump’s government has put on has made it more difficult to get the children into a temporary fetus.
Usually, foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, fearing to put their chances of staying in the country in jeopardy by offering themselves to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when official authorities announced that potential foetal parents and other adults in the home had to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the Immigrant Surveillance Authority.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a commander of the immigration and customs officer, witnessed before the Senate and said that his agency had arrested a number of people who applied for fostering single children.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not in criminal records.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in the home of fostering children are illegal, and much of them are illegal immigrants.
"So we continue to search for those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to resolve children’s situation more quickly, representatives announced new rules requiring some children to appear in a court within a month of their incarceration, rather than after 60 days of the previous course, according to the staff working in the event.
Many of them will come through a video conference, rather than personally, to explain their legal position before a judge in immigration matters.
The children who are judged incapable of entry into the country are quickly sent out of the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or refugee attempts, according to residents and reports published in the past months.
Speakers said that these problems were even more likely in a larger organization like in Tornillo, where the number of children is likely to be noted.
They added that the child’s transfer to the Tent City without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could increase the shock that many of them already face.
Syria tells the United States, France, and Turkey to retire immediately
Walid al-Moualem, Minister of Foreign Affairs, also said in his speech at the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Vice Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false premise of fighting terrorism, and that “they will be dealt with accordingly. ”
“ They must retreat immediately and without any conditions, ” he said to the Congress.
Moualem firmly claimed that “the war against terrorism was almost over ” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to carry out this holy battle until we cleanse all Syrian areas“ of both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreigners. ”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, where most of them train and advise both Korean troops and Syrian Arabs fighting the President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - stricken country.
As for refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances were good enough to return, and he taught “some Western countries ” to“ spread out unfounded fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“ We have called upon an international community and a humanity organization to facilitate their return, ” he said.
“ They create politics from something that should be merely humanistic. ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for rebuilding in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the Resistance to end the war.
The United States states that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the last major resistance fortress has given rise to the opportunity to continue political discussions.
The treaty between Russia and Turkey prevented a great attack by Syrian troops, strengthened by the Russians, in the province of three million people.
Moualem, on the other hand, stressed that the contract had “a clear final time, ” declaring the hope that military action would be directed to Jihadístum, including the Nusra Front fighters, who are associated with Al-Qaeda, and that they were“ destroyed. ”
Staffan de Mistura, the U.S. Ambassador, hopes to come to the first meeting with a new committee composed of members of the Government and the Resistance, to make a constitution for Syria after the war and pay the streets for elections.
Moualem presented conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that her work should be limited to “approaching the provisions of the current government, ” and warned about all interventions.
The reasons for Trump will win another election period
According to that remark, Mr. Trump would win the re-elections in 2020, unless charges and scandals end his presidential career, as many liberal audiences are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a presidential career ever! ”
At present, the audience has no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, the best time views have doubled up to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million audiences at the best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million audiences four years ago, according to Nielsen, and a feature of the MSNBC, The Rachel Maddow Show, has topped views with up to 3.5 million audiences on important news evenings.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don’t understand, ” said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama shows “Designated Survivor” on a government official who will be president after the Senate has been destroyed.
Nell Scovell, experienced writer and writer of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another hypothesis.
She remembers a cab in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked.
“ He said, “Because he makes me laugh, ” said Miss Scovell to me.
It's a pleasure value in the mess.
Unlike TV, however, Washington’s stories could determine Roe v. Wade’s fate, whether the families of immigrants can unite and health of the international economy.
Only the audience who enjoys the greatest privilege can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you watch a sixth - time group of experts reasoning Bob Woodwards on “deeply close ” sources for their book “Fears, ” or 15,000 - bucks - jacket from struts that Paul Manafort wore (“fooded by pride, ” Washington Post) and the consequences of the exact biological descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr Trump.
I will at least never look Super Mario the same again.
“As for what he does, it feels like a reality show, it gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the “Pawn Stars, ” when he discussed the staff campaign in Trump’s show and daily changes in the history threads (e.g. starting a fight with N.F.L., and commendation of Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one factor, or you'll lose the wire.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, there was 26 degrees of heat and sunshine outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed inside and watched MSNB while he recorded CNN.
He could not break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to witness before the judicial committee of the Senate, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were making all these crazy shows in the old days, ” said Mr. Fleiss to me, “this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization. ”
“ I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right. ”

Money to Outflow in the nearest middle-term elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th choice area sees the money flowing to itself, thanks to the reorganization of the choice areas that led to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area sends forward the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another choice area in special elections last summer.
Lamb opposes another representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old 12th choice area in Pennsylvania, which is much in line with the new 17th choice area.
The selection maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old choice areas were organized for the benefit of the Republicans and that it would violate the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th choice area has been the beginning of a competition in the financing of election campaigns between the main financial partners of both groups, the Democratic Committee on Vocational Affairs (DCCC) and the NRCC.
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in special elections in March before the 18th choice area in Pennsylvania, many watched these elections.
The Republicans had previously warmed it for more than a decade, and Donald Trump, President of the Republic, was won in the ideal area with 20 points.
Political experts have given a little precedence to the Democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for the support of China, but then resigned.
Government monarchs noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, with small oppositions from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017, and stayed at a Panama hotel until the members of the Trump Corporation team were driven away.
Deputies of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to revoke the American ambassador of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of “a new decision to no longer accept Taiwan, ” said Heather Nauert, the minister’s spokesman in early this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received 140 million dollars from the United States for aid in 2017, including drug monitoring, development and economic support.
The penalties imposed, including reductions in financial support and restrictions on the release of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central America, with high unemployment and high mortality.
As the meetings continued, the American and Central American representatives of the Conference on Security and Economic Success were to follow a similar meeting that was held last year and considered to be a step forward in action to prevent people from moving to the United States.
By mid - September, however, representatives from the upper ranks made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending all the discussions of punishment against El Salvador.
Mr. Mike Pence, Vice President, is now addressing the conference to be held in the middle of October, representing the importance of it in the eyes of the government, said the Ambassadors.
The three Ambassadors in the United States also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard messages or penalties from Washington.
The spokesman of the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss the discussions described by the three American representatives, including two missionaries, who agreed to discuss the inhabited arguments against being anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the government and also spoke about the matter against anonymousness.
Learning History
The next scandalous case might be Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, report on the possible actions of Mr Trump to prevent justice, but for that accusation there are a variety of official evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller also turns his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was working with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Senate will be governed by another class, Trump may have to be responsible for it, at the time he prepares to meet his voters again, and perhaps his abdomen appointed equals.
However, this is very uncertain, and I do not want to point out that the fall of Trumps is unequivocal, nor the fall of his colleague in Europe.
We all have to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will influence the length of the battle.
In 1938, German leaders were prepared to rob Hitler of power, only if the Western countries had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed to do so and lost the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of disaster.
History turns around such important points and speeds, or delays, for the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The Americans are faced with a number of such important points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump runs Rod Rosenstein State Attorney, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's research?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had proposed to make secret recordings of the president and to discuss whether he was incapable of office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
“ How will we react if the newly requested FBI study at Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court in spite of likely accusations of sexual reliance and dishonest witness?
And above all, will we vote for a congress in the middle period which will allow Mr. Trump to shoulder responsibility?
If we fall through these tests, the democracy will have to last long winter.
But I believe that we will not fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Jew from Czechoslovakia, was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and formerly sat in my ambassador’s residence.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the hake cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I be more than looking forward to our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Rangers' team, optimistic for the Rapid Vienna game
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get out of the G Group of the European Union.
A knee injury prevented the central guard Graham Dorrans from playing his first game in the season until in the game against Villareal that ended with 2-2 equals, but he believes that Rangers can use the finals as a jumpboard for better success.
“ It was good to have this score for us, ” said Dorran, 31 years old.
“ We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Perhaps we could have squeezed victory at the end, but as a whole, equal was probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better at the first half of the game, and we came strong into the second half - game and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European Department.
Hopefully we can achieve three points, but it'll be a tough game because they did a good job in their last game, but with the audience who supports us, I'm sure we'll do this and get a positive final.
The last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that happened in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling in the area.
The team is good and the boys enjoy themselves, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move further now, put the last season behind us and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing retirement savings
Although the participants in the poll had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said that they discussed the cost of long - term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent claimed to discuss this with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of it, but it does not take the right steps to hold those conversations, ” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Life Insurance Department of Nationwide.
That's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not make your wishes clear with good care.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you are being cared for, as these options can change much in terms of cost.
Get your financial counselor involved: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays in cash, to help pay expenses, or self-insurance with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: prevent legal differences in advance.
Get a health care officer so that you can appoint someone you trust to supervise your health care and ensure that healthcare professionals respond to your requests if you cannot express them directly.
Consider, too, to get a procure for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and will make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is going to a hospital in an emergency situation.
Could you answer questions about medicines and hypersensitivity?
Please provide this information exactly in a written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It’s not just about the finances, but also about who the doctors are, ” Martin said.
“ What are the medicines?
Who will guard the dog?
Keep that plan ready."

Earthquakes and Flood Waves in Indonesia
At least 384 died after a severe earthquake and flooding in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said representatives, and the number of the dead is expected to rise.
Since all communication is down, aid workers have not been able to provide any information from the Donggala County, which is a region north of Palu, near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 at Richter.
Over 16,000 people were left homes in Palu after the calamity occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of the Central Sulawes District and is located at the bottom of a narrow flea on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379.800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 380 miles [380 km] of a coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The governmental sector under the province had an estimated population of up to 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sectors of the Central-Sulawes region, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, most of which are in Morowali, a beach facing Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Institute, flood waves have swelled in Palu and Donggala several times in the past century.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a flood wave struck, and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
In 1996, the west part of Donggala, where nine died, would also be flooded.
Indonesia sits on the active ring of the Pacific Fire, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the main earthquakes and flooding waves of recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh region in the north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a flood that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian coastline, of which over half was in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes crossed the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people die on the island of Nias, from the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake of 6.8 on Richter crossed the southern part of Java, the largest island of Indonesia, causing a flood that hit the southern coast and nearly killed 700 people.
2009: A earthquake up to 7.6 on Richter crossed near Padang, the capital of the province of the west Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A earthquake of 7.5 on Richter crossed one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, and raised up to 10 meters [10 m] high flooding waves that destroyed many villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: The pidie Jaya County of Aceh was grounded by an earthquake and caused destruction and horror when people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and flooding waves in 2004.
No tsunami was formed this time, but over 100 died when buildings collapsed.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, is greatly shaky, and more than 500 people died, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stuck on the island.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for the charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and presidential candidate, has been arrested for a charge of physical assault.
The 29 - year - old Palin, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for attempting to prevent the announcement of domestic violence and fight against arrest, according to a report from the Alaska State Police, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone off her friend when she tried to call the police to report a suspected crime.
Palin is held at the Mat-Su station where he awaits hearings before judgment, and he is held against $500 insurance, according to a report from KTUU.
On Saturday, when he was asked to declare guilty or innocent, he appeared to be “not guilty, firm, ” according to the news station.
Palin is accused of three crimes in class A, which means that he could be sentenced to prison for up to one year and has to pay $250,000.
He has also been accused of a crime in Class B, which is punished with one day in prison and $2000.
This is not the first time Palin's been accused.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is now being dealt with for the right to surrender in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, for preventing domestic violence, and for carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of surrender soldiers in 2016, following his military service in Iraq, after a shock attack on his son’s violent behavior.
The earthquake and the flooding waves of Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a earthquake crossed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 on Richter triggered a wave of flooding and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electromagnetic and communication systems are declining and the number of dead is expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake was just in the middle of the Sulawesi Island, located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing the time when the event was going on on the social media.
Hundreds of people had assembled at a coastal festival in the city of Palu when the flood wave hit the beach.
Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
New Yorkan attorneys want death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected to have participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people.
Saipov, 30 years old, is thought to have rented a Home Depot truck to attack people on a bike path along the street of West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan, where he drove down walking and riding road users in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “duely” and caused serious physical injuries“ intentionally, ” according to the deliberate declaration of imprisonment of death, enacted in the Southern Judgment of New York.
Both of these prosecutors can lead to possible death penalty, according to the legal document.
Many weeks after the attack, Saipov accused the federal court of 22 parties, including eight charges for murder for criminal purposes, which are usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized crime organizations, and Saipov was also accused of violence and for destroying the car.
The attack included “a considerable planned plan, ” professed prosecutors and described Sapiov’s actions as“ horrible, cruel, and immoral. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was caused to physical injuries, harm and loss for families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, ” says the wild statement.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is a decade since the southern part of New York took the last case of death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually convicted in a lifetime prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a New York court case in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married couples who were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both of them were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of repentance during the days and months after the attack, according to legal records.
He said to an investigator that he was happy with what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he had received the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, as stated in the charge.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 points of the accusation.
David Patton, one of the official defenders of Saipov, said that they were “deliberately disappointed ” by the decision of the prosecutor.
“ We believe that the decision to ask for death penalty instead of accepting a declaration of guilt against lifetime imprisonment without the possibility of a trial release, will only extend the shock due to this event for all the shareholders, ” said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
Congressman says that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “activate the people’s army ” today in protests at the Conservatives’ Conference.
This former leader, Ukip, said that politicians must “feel pressure ” from doubters about the EU, at the same time as one of the Congressmen of Theresu May suggested that he conduct the negotiations with the EU.
Conservator Peter Bone said in Birmingham Protestant to Britain that if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit, Britain would have been gone out now.
However, the challenge May faces in confronting deep differences between her own teams was even more evident as conservators who want to remain in the EU participated in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulties in keeping his Chequer's plan in the right direction and is subject to criticism from those who support Brexit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
The Allies claimed that she will continue to fight to reach agreement with Brussels despite opposition and forcing those opposing Brexit and the Working Party to choose between her plan and “inconvenience. ”
Mr. Bone said to the Leave Means Leave Protesting in Solihull that he wanted to “sleep away from the Chequers plan. ”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been allowed to participate and shoulder responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, we would have gone out now, ” he said.
The senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan. ”
He explained his opposition to the EU: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone pointed out that the public opinion had changed from the elections in 2016: “The idea that the British public changed their minds and wants to stay is totally unfair. ”
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative supporter of Brexit, too, said to the reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequer's plan is impotent among the public, and the opposition will not vote with it, and it enjoys inequality among our classmen and activists who are on the streets and vote for us.
Please, stop Chequer's plan and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added: “Presidents keep the job when they fulfill their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said that the politicians had to “feel pressure ” if they were to defraud from the decision taken after the 2016 vote.
“ This is now about trust between us — our people and our political party, ” he said.
“ They want to try to betray Brexit, and we are here today to say to them, “We will not let you get away with this. ”
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to be pressured by your political party, who is betraying Brexit.
We act as an army of the public in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-controllable, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, the supporters of the European Union held a protest process in Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour protest meeting in the city.
A small group of activists waved the flag of the conservators against Brexit after the group was set up during the weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Workers group made fun of the conservatives because of security problems that came up in the group’s telephone program when the conference was opened.
“ This is the people who tell us that they can have all computer systems and all technology for Canada plus, at a border without obstacles, for free business with Ireland without borders, ” he added.
“ This is a scandal.
There is nothing to call good Brexit," he said.
Warren intends to “think seriously ” to submit to the presidential office.
After the elections in November, Elizabeth Warren, a United States Senator, says that he is going to “think seriously to the presidential office. ”
In a Boston Globe report, the Democrat from Massachusetts discussed his future at a civil meeting in the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has rarely criticized President Donald Trump, volunteers for re-elections in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, co-ordinating Trump’s campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of the speculation that she could volunteer against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with residents in her choice, since Trump took office.
One of the attendants at the meeting asked her if she was planning to volunteer for a president.
Warren replied that it would be time for “women to go to Washington to correct our government, and then a woman as a leader needs to be done. ”
Arrest after a fatal shooting on Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at a news meeting at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, she had previously published a video of the shooting attack, asking for help to identify the man seen on the recording.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near the Southern University area early on Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died because of it, ” said Chief Murphy J. Paul, to the press on Saturday, according to a 247 - sports report.
Wayde came to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to have been in the scene, with a weapon in his hands, and admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without trouble and put in custody at the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was two yards tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, including 10 in the first team in the last season and played on average 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points, and reached 2.9 discounts in each game.
The Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat on their command.
It was clear from the fact that Valtteri Bottas reached a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before the launch on Saturday, that orders from the team of Mercedes would play a big part in the contest.
Bottas got a good start, leaving Hamilton almost as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel first went to the pit and let Hamilton enter the traffic at the end of the group, which should have been the ultimate.
The Mercedes car went to the pit one ring later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton found out after a short fight, where Ferrari’s driver was forced to leave the inner side after having had the risk of being left behind, after the third turn attempts.
Max Verstappen began in the back of the group and was on the seventh seat at the end of the first round, on his 21th birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he delayed changing tires to try to finish quickly and leave Kimi Raikkonen and reach the fourth seat.
Finally, he went to the pit in 44rd circle but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight circles, and Raikkonen took his fourth seat.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team has done great work to achieve this," Hamilton said.
That was really a bad body exercise.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein in a Saturday meeting because of her claim that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accused of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court of Justice, on sexual responsibility.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but he did not directly discuss the testimony from Ford before the Senate Committee, instead saying that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and unreasonable. ”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the last days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and hurt and cruel and unfaithful, ” he said.
“ When you see the lights and the leaks and then say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you work this out?
Do you remember her answer... did you defeat the document - “Oh, what?
Oh, no.
So I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
We don't leak," he said and imitated the Senate Senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the charges from Ford against Kavanaugh were made, so early in September, Feinstein refused that the leak had come from her office.
“I did not hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I did not lay down her story, ” said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“ She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did what she asked me to do. ”
But her denial did not seem to fit in with the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “Let me tell you, it was really a bad body exercise.
Maybe she didn't lay down, but this was the worst body exercise I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense for Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of three women’s sexual abuse, and pointed out that the Democrats were taking advantage of the accusations.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what method.
You see the cruelty, the badness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to choose to take over and rule," said the president, according to a report from Mediaite.
Elite League Division: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two marks for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars improved his loss on Friday in the Elite League division against Belfast Giants by winning next game, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants got two marks ahead from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie evened for the locals, but Dwyer came back to Giants.
Francois Bouchard subdued Dundee, and two marks from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was the third loss game in the season before the team Adam Keefe in the Elite League Division, which had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game between the teams during the season, and Giants had won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute, when the clock showed 3,35, after a message from Kendall McFaull, David Rutherford then delivered a support message when Beauvillier doubled its predecessor four minutes later.
Then it was a great deal to be in the first few minutes, and Sullivan returned the locals when the clock was 13.10, and Cownie then recovered after a message from Matt Marquardt in the fifteenth minute.
Dwyer arranged to get Giants over for half-play when he scored his second goal in the game at the end of the first third.
The community joined together, and Bouchard recovered from the target when they were one man over to the 27th minute of another third.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together and helped Nielsen bring Dundee over for the first time in the second quarter of the game, and he secured his team victory with the fifth goal when half of the last third.
Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, receive Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
A flight manager kills to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane are escaped from an earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia has been welcomed as a hero after he died in ensuring that hundreds of passengers could take up a plane in full.
More than 800 people have died, and many have been missed after a major earthquake crossed the island of Sulawesi on Friday and followed by a flooding wave.
The area continues to be plagued by major postquakes, and many are stuck under ruins in the city of Palu.
The 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his associates had fled the steering tower that swiftly swinged to Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was staying to ensure that the Batik Air plane number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake crossed, could certainly succeed.
He then jumped out of the steering tower when he thought he was falling.
He later died in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News, Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“ We are very sad to hear this, ” he added.
The government fears that the number of the dead could exceed a thousand, when the National Disaster Agency says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
“ The number of dead is still rising, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Institute.
Up to six feet [6 m] of waves have caused a tremendous destruction in Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
The army and passenger aircraft are working on providing supplies and supplies.
A 35 - year - old mother, Giant Kusuma, said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There's little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is keen to find survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it may go worse."
On Sunday, President Indonesia, Joko Widodo, told the army of the country: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the missions related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said a report from CNN.
Earlier this year, earthquakes in Indonesia, where more than 550 people died, swooped over Lombok.
A micronesia air crash: Air Niugini now says that the same is missing after a plane crashed into the Leone
The airline, which had a plane crashing into a lonia in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, after having said that all 47 passengers and crews had escaped from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in the announcement that from the afternoon on Saturday, it did not know about the execution of one male passenger.
The airline said that it was working with the local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not answer any questions about the person’s age or nationality.
The boats in the area helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land on the airport on the Chuuk Island.
On Friday, representatives said that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that all of them were stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and the exact order of the incidents.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane had landed in the zone just before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway too far.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the flight was very low.
“ That was really good, ” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others could wade the waist deep water and reach emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots were frightened and shouting, and that he had had a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that seafarers at work in a distance from making up a dock also helped to rescue by using a blown up boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters [30 m] of deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in the flight accidents of the PNG-registered aircraft in the last two decades, none of which had been associated with Air Niugini.
A expert describes the timeline of the evening when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors closed their proceedings on Saturday in re-uptake of a case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for hours as a expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He thus described how he used cell phone records to put together the journeys of the defendant, 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
On Saturday, Sanford witnessed and said that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said that it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile data showed that they had only known for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis wiped out text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He destroyed it out of his life, ” said Hale.
It is estimated that the defendants will deliver their final talk on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected that the matter would be brought to court later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hippie jump?
Hipp Tri Island wants to fight negative views of the music by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hippie hopes have diverted its origin, containing political messages and discussing social issues.
They want to search the source again and make conscious hops hope popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and the Common have recently seen a change in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A nursing in New York City prosecutes a couple for disfellowshipping after a “prejudicial ” text message
A nursing in New York City sues a couple for an unlawful expedition after an accidental text message from the mother, complaining that she was “another black person. ”
The couple refuse to be prejudiced and compare the application to “pressure. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she found that her new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
“NEEEEEIIIII OTHER SWEDEN MAN,” wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the messages to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her mistakes, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman said that their former foetus, who was black, had done badly, and that she had expected to have a Philippine woman, according to a news report from the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for her one day of work and then sent home in Uber’s car.
Maurice now sues the couple and wants compensation for the disfellowshipping, that the amount of $350 a day for the six - month job that she had originally been employed for, although no contract was signed.
“ I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do this, ” she said to Post on Friday and added, “I know that this is discrimination. ”
The couple have objected to the accusation that they were prejudiced and say that it was the right thing to fire Maurice, since they felt that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“ My wife sent her messages that she didn’t mean to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced people, ” said the husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“ But who would trust their children after showing the offense, even if it was an accident?
His newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco likened the prosecutor to “courage, ” and said that his wife was seven months on her way and was in“ severe situations. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this condition?
It's not very nicely done," said Plasco, who works in the investment sector.
The case is still in court, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple in the social media and has embarrassed them for their conduct and arguments.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would find it difficult to like talking bear, says a new letter.
Regarding the letter, Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said: “It is difficult to follow someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
“ It’s very funny now that we know of Paddington’s tremendous success. ”
She said that her father, who worked as a filmmaker at BBC before he was inspired to write a book of children about a small toy bear, had taken a calmly positive rejection of his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was “a love ” after his death last year.
As for Paddington, which she describes as “a very important family member, ” she added that her father had been quietly proud of his success.
“ He was a very quiet man, and he was not used to boast, ” she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you had a child who accomplishes something, and you are proud of it even if you did nothing for yourself.
I think he kind of looked at Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the honor of himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been moved to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything they could to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she would not be expected to survive, ” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then Nad called me and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to sustain her heartbeat were gradually losing her activity and excreted from her body.
She had died shortly before, and this was her body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her dead daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
“ No one knew anything, ” she said.
“ I dripped my head, and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Tragic Women Hanging Messages to Avoid Suicide on a Bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a message on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, a 13 - year - old son of Miss Davis, began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18 years old.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day, ” she said.
Miss Davis, 45 years old, lives in Lydney and said that her son was a successful cook with a contagious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, for he was “sucked into a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother dead after he killed himself.
Miss Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that it will be a aftermath. ”
Miss Davis made the message “to let people know that you can go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don't sit and say nothing - you need to talk to someone."
Miss Humphrey, who has been a friend of Miss Davies for years, lost his spouse Mark to 15 years of age shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t talk about feeling bad or being depressed, ” she said.
“ Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his temper.
He was at his worst on Christmas -- when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a shock to them, but they had to work out it: “This tears a hole in the family.
This will break us apart.
But we have to keep on fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is hanging on a wire when the FBI has its investigation.
“ I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for – a study with a limited amount of time and scope – we might be able to get a little more comfortable, ” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “cut apart ” in the middle of a conflict between the groups, where everything was in a retreat.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican group want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their patience is due to the timing.
The mid - period surveys are only five weeks, November 6, and if the Republicans are going badly, as expected, they will weaken their serious efforts to get their husband elected to sit in the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes their investigation report?
A vote will be held at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still not possible that Mr. Kavanaugh may have at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would enable Mr. Mike Pence to break up the level and confirm him in the office of the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea “reduces ” under Kim
The number of those who flee from North Korea and go to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong-un reigned seven years ago, according to a congressman from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug quoted data from the South Korea Confederation Council and said that 1127 people escaped last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border warning between North Korea and China and higher charges paid by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued a public declaration.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to have a South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that over 30,000 people from North Korea crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most people flee to China, but it has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross them than that of neutral areas between North and South Korea.
China views the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Technologically speaking, relations between North and South Korea, which are still in war, have improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier in this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions mainly about delayed nuclear decommissioning negotiations.
This was after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and President Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together towards the nuclear-free Korean island.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Minister of North Korea, blamed US traders for a lack of progress since then.
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the safety of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to first take down our one - sided nuclear weapons, ” said Ri in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “Mother Disease ” and says he is incapable of the work of Supreme Court Judge
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the Senate, called Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge “Mother Disease, ” and said he was too temperamental to serve in the Supreme Court.
On Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, Pelosi made these words appear in an interview.
“ I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called hysterical, ” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s witness to the Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh disowned the great accusation that he had offended Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both youths.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he shouted, and when he talked about his family and school years, he got a cake in his throat.
He also publicly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him “an intimidated and organized reputation ” that were organized by liberals who were angry at the loss of the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was partial to the Democrats.
“I think these claims and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats show that he is incapable of the job, ” she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh out of work if confirmed and if demokrats reach the majority of the council.
“ I’ll say this: if he is not telling the House or the FBI the truth, he is not only incapable of being in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now, ” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge in the appeal court in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the medical legislation Affordable Care Act or the abortion laws of Roe v. Wade, where he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At the interrogation, Kavanaugh turned aside questions about whether he would overturn the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“ This is no time for a mother - sick, partial person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say “a great thing is wonderful, ” Pelosi said.
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is a fair speech, months and years of wrath, and it does not come from it without weeping.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
“ I don’t think it’s uncommon, but you ”
She continued, “I received much help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also wept when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and began crying, she said to her interviewer,“ You may think I am sad because I am crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to express partial anger because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job that I had in my office with a majority of men, where I began to cry with anger that I couldn't express, came an older woman and took my head in. She was a cold officer, which I had always feared a little, and she pulled me into a stairwell.
“ Never let them see you cry, ” she said to me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think that you are sad, and rejoice that you have come in upon you."
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was presidential, then a Democratic Senator from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an impostation on board a boat called Monkey Business (Apaspil) and retired his offer, Miss Schroeder, full of indignation, felt that there was no reason why she could not consider making herself a president.
“ It wasn’t a good decision, ” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone named it "Mill White, and the seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign had passed a long time, she was behind as a fundraiser, so she promised not to volunteer unless she could collect two million dollars.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
“ Do they think I'll get a discount? ” she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not offer herself formally, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration to the system, which made it so difficult to earn money and direct her seas to voters instead of representatives, and anger to the sexual discrimination - that she broke into crying.
“ It could be thought that I had had a nervous breakdown, ” said Miss Schroeder when she recalls how the media reacted.
“ It could be thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
Reasons that Business Wars Between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the commercial war between the United States and China were overwhelming, and even though the war is far from over, a long - term gap could be beneficial for Beijing, says experts.
U.S. president Donald Trump shot the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s main export goods, including sunflower, steel, and aluminium.
This week, the highest rate increase came with new customs charges covering the value of 200 billion dollars (U.S.) and taxing nearly half of all goods transferred to the United States from China.
Peking has responded in the same coin each time and recently paid 5 to 10 percent of the bills on American products for $60 billion.
China has pledged to respond to the United States Customs Reform, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will fall short.
To get Washington to jump, it would be too humiliating for China’s President, Xi Jinping, to bow down publicly to the United States.
However, experts say that if Peking keeps the cards right, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive effect on China for a long time, by reducing the mutual need of both ecosystems for each other.
“ The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could lead to circumstances that lead to economic collapse in one country is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have previously acknowledged, ” said Abigail Grace, a investigator focusing primarily on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria “prepared ” for refugees to return, says the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be prepared for refugees to return willingly to the land and seek help to rebuild the land, which is now in a bad condition after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, Foreign Minister, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, saying that the situation in the country is getting better.
“ Today, ” he said, “the situation on earth is more stable and safe, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism. ”
The government continues to develop normal situations by building areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return willingly to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and one-sided economic decisions against their daily lives and jobs.
The United States estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the land since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that Syrian authorities would like help to rebuild the country.
On the other hand, he stressed that they would not accept aid depending on conditions or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 by winning the United States team with the final results of 16.5 to 10.5 points in the Le Golf National Field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive European bases and has not won the Cup of Ryder in Europe since 1993.
As the Danish leader Thomas Björn led Europe to regain the crown again, it reached the 14.5 points needed to conquer the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was most troubled in the entire race, hit the 16th hole in the water and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined brightly in all its games and became 1 out of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the contest began using its current style in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was at the bottom of the order of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who possibly played in his last race for the Ryder cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times about the Ryder cup, became the winner of the European race of 25.5 degrees.
“ I usually don’t weep, but today I can’t do anything else.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get that cup back.
This is about the team, and I was pleased to be able to help, ” said the emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He gives his country John Rahm the famed, who conquered the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
“ I was incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, ” said 23 - year - old Rahm, “and I grew up watching him.
Woods lost all his four games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the race for the Ryder cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 big titles and is only second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time all weekend to find themselves in the field, besides Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
After disappointment with the performance of their team, the U.S. commander, Jim Fury said: “I am proud of them, they fought.
It was at some point in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him down.
I'll take off Thomasi.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with PGA in the United States and the name of the Ryder cup, and we'll go on.
I love these 12 men, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off.
They played better than we did."
