Welsh MEPs do not want to appear as "muppets"
Members of the Wales National Assembly, which are now known under the abbreviation AM (Asembly Members), are not fully satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of the plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Walesian Parliament.
Representatives from the whole political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A representative of the Labour Working Party explained his group was concerned because “it rhymes on Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means "dumb", and pwp means "bajs".
A representative of the Wales Party, Plaid Cymru, said that the group as a whole was “dissatisfied” and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Walesian part of the Conservative Party said that his group was ‘open’ for the change of name, but noted that the pronunciation of the MWP is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British serpent for ‘dust’.
In this context, the Walesian letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like an “uh” sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: “Of course, it is the members themselves who have the last right to rule on the name with which they should be mentioned.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Wales National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public hearing which showed public support to rename the National Assembly to the Walesian Parliament.
With regard to the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
The representatives seem to suggest other options, but to get all parties to a consensus can lead to headbreaks for President Elin Jones, who, according to the plan, will provide a legislative draft for the change of names in the next few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes in the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for the disqualification of representatives and the design of the Committee System.
The representatives have the last right to vote on what to call them when they debate the law.
Macedonians go to the election turns to decide whether to change the country’s name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote on whether the name of their country is to be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is held in an attempt to solve a decade long dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in their territory and has on several occasions opposed its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gerge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the change of names, has said that he will ignore the vote.
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of names is simply the price they must pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The watches of St. Martin’s styles — the crickets of Harlem are wrestling
“The old people I talked to have told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
"Now there is none of the things."
He said that the bars' apostasy was understandable.
"People associate socially in other ways" today, he says.
"Barer is no longer the local environment's meeting places, which everyone visits regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe; "And sooner or later they will be back at the beginning."
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment building full of the kind of people who do not want to help the neighborhood’s remaining shelter.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches must close the doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.”
Both crickets were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis — Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin’s received a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a bocott by dealers on 125th Street — one of Harlem’s main supervisors — because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 made great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson’s parish children made plans for the reconstruction, they purchased a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that carillonet was “the poor people's church bells. ”
The expert who played the carillonet in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "a irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillonet in the world played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillonet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complex interaction between architects and contractors, some of which have been hired by the church's playman management and others of the bispedømme.
The Church Council — the congregation’s management, composed of doctors — wrote to the Bispeer in July about its concern that the Bispedømme would “try to force the costs ” at the church council, despite the fact that the council had not been involved in the rental of the architects or entrepreneurs sent by the Bispedømme.
Some parish children complained of lack of openness from the bispedømme.
Shark hurts a thirteen-year-old in a lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy when he showed up for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, and that he and a group of others were swimming over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he thought first that the boy shouted with enthusiasm over having caught a lobster, but he realized as the boy shouted 'I was bitten!
I was bitten."
His whole collar leg was torn up, says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
"I cried out that everyone should get out of the water, 'There is a shark in the waters', and added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Warden Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious damage in the upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most people are not hired as dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to make its intake in the UK beauty care market.
Sainsbury's challenger Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with warehouse-like makeup and beauty nursery shelves, manned by specially trained employees.
The expanded shelves are tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a powerful invasion of the UK’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which experiences constant growth while the sales of clothing and home items fall, and if the attempt proves to be successful, the concept will be expanded to several shops next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket attempts to find a new use of the space previously used for TVs, microwaves and home items.
Sainsbury's has said they should double the number of beauty care products they offer for 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the butig has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better place in marked brand areas, just as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its Boutique brand with mainly vegan products, because there is increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores. The one opened in Croydon in South London last week, while the other opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online trade and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, has said that sales will gradually look more and more like a warehouse, as the supermarket will take up the fight against the cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with several services and goods outside food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago, according to which this has increased food sales and made the purchases more profitable.
The last attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the beauty care and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots early in the 21st century, but the cooperation was settled after a dispute on the distribution of the income of the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold his 281 store chapters to Celesio, owner of the pharmacy chain Lloyds Pharmacy, GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan by adding a selection of luxurious skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Trade Director, said: “We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty shelves to create more inviting environments for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained coworkers who are so ready to give advice and help.
Our label committee is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations make us now a beauty career competitor representing a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones is “smart” after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' Denstar Peter Jones is supposed to be furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled off a 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessory mark, Truly.
Their Society was earlier compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s mark, Goop.
Willoughby (37), this morning's program manager, announced on Instagram that she's leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons' The Star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing their profitable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on his own new golden contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “smart” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the golden girl of the television admitted that her new agreements – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time for their clothing and accessories brands, Truly.
The Society has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she will leave Truly, Jones left Britain on the way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s first priority.
It was a long - term investment that would provide her with financial security for the next decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has chosen to retire.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday — it was just before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters, which is now ready for sale.”
Experts believe that this Morning program manager, among the most popular stars in Britain, may cost the company several million pounds because of major investment in products such as pillows and light, fashion and cosmetics, as well as a potential delay in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the last ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with the Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became the chairman of the board in March.
The two couple go on vacation together, and Jones has 40% ownership in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a branding ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin who hosts the I'm A Celebrity I'm A.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We don't want to comment on his business affairs."
"And then we fell in love."
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for having made a comment some would consider as 'little presidential' and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news bomber.
"I have not given away anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big filth on the road to the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea’s top diploma Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “equivalent response” from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead, the United States has continued sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a assembly of his voters.
"We are doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go to war against North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a very good relationship.”
He said that his work to improve his relationship with Kim has given positive results, such as stopping rockets, contributing to the release of hostages and the remnant of U.S. officials.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this stappy arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said and pointed to the area right ahead.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia destroy an island and kill hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign ideal organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombox residents had lost their homes, there was no national catastrophe, which is a requirement for international assistance to be sent in.
“In many cases, they have made it quite clear that they do not ask for international help, so it is quite challenging,” Sumbung explained.
Save the children now set up a team to travel to Palu but is not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Crisis Management Agency, said that Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations are allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes of Indonesia, the country is terribly poorly prepared to deal with nature’s anger.
Lights to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, although an alert had been sent out, has likely contributed to the mortality rate.
Even under the best circumstances, traveling between the Indonesian many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrading of Indonesia's fallen-finished infrastructure to a key point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and railroad.
But lack of money has been a major problem for Joko’s administration, which will be re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have switched to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to escape their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge with late compensation in battle against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League loss against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting for 89 minutes at the Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea target while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it to the longest corner.
The test went high over the box as the ball fell to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball crossed a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq are always sending the ball forward as well as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and touched the ball once, and I didn't think too much of it, and I just kicked it."
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in 25 minutes.
The Blues assault player sent a pass with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed his direction near the midway and swept into Liverpool's track half.
Kovacic came with a quick delivery on the middle track.
He then fired by a great breakthrough fit that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner met a left-foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Napoli in the group game of Champions League at 3:00 on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo, Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League in soccer for men in London at 3:00 on Thursday.
Death Rate from the Tsunami in Indonesia reaches 832
The death rates of Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunami have increased to 832, announced the National Crisis Management Agency early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a strike of 7.5 that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, explains the spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 3,80,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from ruined buildings.
The police arrest a man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death.
A murder investigator has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested, suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard something about contacting.
Detective Brian O'Hagan says: “We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I want to ask everyone in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on their car camera, to contact — they may have information that is crucial to our investigation. ”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the deceased woman was resident in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman has arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said they're working to inform the victim's relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The inhabitants are now told that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was interrogated when he told a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the crime scene.
She repeats, "It is so horrible" over and over.
At 14 o'clock, two police cars were behind the lockdown, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers were standing outside the lockdown and supervised the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, referring to ‘log 247’ from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial that has been drawn into the dispute about "to rewrite history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatic puritans.
But the Comwell Society's history has described Jeremy Crick's publisher as "dumb" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace would also become a goal.
The idoloclasm of the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing production of Cromwell is a proof of the 1800s' opinions and is part of historic history for a man many people still feel deserve to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today as Parliament's defence against pressure from the outside – in his time, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killing pigs kills Chinese peasant
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, who is mentioned only with the surname “Yuan”, was found dead and covered by blood from a cracked artery near a binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the town of Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently, he had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the gate of a nearby pig trail was open.
He said inside the pork stove there was a big mistake with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a judicial investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and malttracted” explained the cousin, mentioned by the surname Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera recordings showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed Yuan wasn't belonging to him or his cousin.
While the police gathered evidence from the crime scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else.
Yuan's family and market management are, apparently, negotiating compensation for the death.
Even if it happens to the source, it is not the first time a pig has been reported to have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts and caused serious harm.
Ten years earlier, a Walesian farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 - kg pig until the farmer’s wife succeeded in chasing the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to the CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to ordinary, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
"They're just playing.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
All you have to do is show sufficient respect."
The rest of the hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in South West America.
As reported, the hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves across the cooler sea on the North Coast of Mexico.
Still, Rosa will bring a flooding rain on her journey through North Mexico and South West America in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a tray begins to form over the Pacific and move east towards the west coast of the United States, while Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity north to the southwestern United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the interaction between tropical humidity and the straw that approaches will lead to widespread, southwestern rain during the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, floating shrub and fast and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep-ropic humidity will lead to rainfall rates of up to 5 to 7 cm per hour in certain areas, especially southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for floods of rapidly worsening conditions because of the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move on foot in the desert as long as there is a risk of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can make rivervedals widely roaring rivers, and thunder will lead to local winds that can contain dust and sand.
The straw that approaches will lead to local rain showers for parts of the coast along South California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to floating shrub and fast, as well as smooth road paths.
This will be the first rainfall in the area.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and will last all Wednesday.
October can lead to intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics are very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout Central America on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, continuous summer heat will try to build up and expand.
Large parts of Central and Eastern America are likely to get a warm start in October, with degrees high in the 20s from South Plains to parts of the North-East America.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that eastern America is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six television networks, saw the thrilling testimony of Thursday from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that is supposed to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to advertise Friday’s big surprise in the last second, when it came out that the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week - long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate’s Court Committee that she is 100% certain that an drunk Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take her clothes off at a school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100% certain that this did not happen.
The shipment on Friday was likely seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average seer numbers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seeer numbers were not immediately available for other networks showing the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems with measuring office viewers.
To give a little perspective, this seer figure is equivalent to the final game in the American soccer championship or Oscar.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose viewpoints have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led by the networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers for the whole day hearing.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a meeting in the court committee while demonstrators shouted at him.
He stood with lowered eyes for several minutes while he was reproached, while the event was sent directly on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he tells the truth to our country?"
He was told that “you have the power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office had made a statement, and when the elevator doors closed, he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination was to be continued to the entire Steering Senate.
But Flake said that he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate by next week, as the democratic minority has encouraged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's elections had a great impact when it was clear that the Republicans had not enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened a FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses the critics of "political gambling" around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the opposers of her plan to leave the EU for "political games" with the future of Britain and undermine the interests of the nation.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, pressed side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, has continued her attack on her so-called "Chequers" plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for the UK and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "whole ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: the police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the death of the LSU player.
The police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) has been arrested and charged for deliberate murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the basketball.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS partner WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he confessed to have shot and killed Wayde.
His guarantee is set at $350.000, according to The Advocate.
Forensics at East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a shot wound in the head and through the throat.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for their team of refugees, the state police lab, the Southern University police and the local population for their contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU's athlete Joe Alleva thanked the local police force for its 'hard work and pursuit of justice'.
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-foot forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "known" and "in shock" after Waydes' death.
"This is what we fear at all times," said Wade.
Vulcan sprays ash over Mexico City
The ash spraying out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico’s capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico’s public body for crisis prevention, warned Mexico’s people on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity rose in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within one day.
The agency monitored several cases of boiling and roasting.
Social media images showed a thin layer of ash that covered the cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophyllists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 shaken central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after Protestants for independence had a confrontation with the police, while thousands participated in competing demon stations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote for liberation.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police and bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handgemen also broke out later that day, when the police used batons to limit the fights.
For hours, independent demonstrators stood and shouted 'Never forget, never forgive,' face to face with Unionist demonstrators who shouted 'Long live Spain'.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension remains high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the referendum on October 1, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catholics.
The vote showed an overwhelming overload of liberation, but it was a bad meeting because the vote was boikotted by most opposers of liberation.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote carried out at election stations throughout the region.
Liberation teams camped in the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was abolished, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia’s ability to become independent.
“ Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy, but now we're stuck, ” he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catholic independence have had problems with maintaining pressure this year, as many of their beech known leaders have traveled in self - imposed exile or are in custody while awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict was stirred up by politicians on both sides.
“The site is becoming more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned for a trial since late last year, announced that he will be elected in the European Parliament next year.
“To stand for elections as candidates in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn oppression and regression from democratic values we have seen from the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years of age have been arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
An armbrow may also have been fired against the car at some point.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 victory against Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
Revised Livinston amazed Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's other losses after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga proved crucial, and Gary Holt’s side is now similar to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won on the distance in the Premier League this season and will play against the leaders Hearts, which lies eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Prior to this, Rangers will play a home fight against Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained undefeated through six battles in the division, and Chief Streams Holt has not yet lost a fight after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is missing opportunities for his dull guests.
Holt’s team was supposed to have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick on after sliding in to meet Craig Halkett head past the target.
The hostship allowed Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for their guests at deathball.
And that is how the decisive goal came to pass.
Rangers gave up a free kick, and Livingston found an opening — Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a clear path, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage, Rangers had had the ball almost all the time, but the defense of the home team had proved to be irreversible and target Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a almost score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the legs of Rangerskeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a wide short-sighting.
Crissings came into the Livingston box and were constantly rescued, while two penalties — once after Halkett’s protest against dividends Glenn Middleton, and once hand in hand — were overlooked.
‘Fenomenumal’ from Livingston — Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenonal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and they continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The play style and crew have hardly changed since they got to the top again, but Holt is supposed to have much of the honor for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing and coordinated a hugely well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toe throughout the fight.
Rangers, on the other hand, did not have my inspiration to divorce.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they could not live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was labs — they only got into the home team’s halfway once — and it was quite a wake-up for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets a mixed reception in Cologne
All was only smiles and blue sky on Saturday 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
There have been divisions in matters such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
While the police indicated safety as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 people were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, many adherents met near to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also heard from them and criticized Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the division that follows a man who is honored as a hero of some German Turks and hated as an autokrat by others.
Deptford collision: bicycles killed in car collision
A cyclist has been killed in a collision like with a passenger car in London.
The collision took place in the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford southeast of the city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the ground.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a driving trip where the driver escaped from the crime scene in Childrens Street, about one kilometre from the Saturday crash.
Metropolitan Police said the police are working on identifying the man and informing the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus-summers are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six cops injured in riots
Six prison officers are injured in an incident at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Rises broke out at HMP Long Lartin, Worcestershire, around 9:30 BST on Sunday, and are still in progress.
Specialized "Tornado" officers are collected to handle the incident, which involves eight prisoners and is limited to one flight.
The cops were treated for minor face damage on the ground.
One prison official said: “Specially trained prison staff have been sent in to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – the responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind locks and beats.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the rebel police were called to deal with a serious incident where the employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (can be favourable for drought areas)
It is the source of Arizona being struck by a tropical lprint, but it is likely that it will happen early next week, as the remaining force of hurricane Rosa moves through the southwestern desert areas and brings floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only “ti tropical cyclines have maintained the status of tropical storms or leafprints within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border of Arizona.”
The last National Hurricane Center models predict 5 to 10 cm of rainfall, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the center of the Rocky Mountains mountain chain and Great Basin, will likely have between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of rain is possible in some areas.
For those outside the flood, Rosa can be a blessing because the area suffers from drought.
Although floods are a serious problem, some of these precipitations will probably be favourable since the South West America is currently in a dry state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, some 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the hurricane Pink land at the Mexican Peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum wind power of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific, thereby losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to meet Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday evening or afternoon.
The precipitation over parts of Mexico can be powerful and cause great flooding.
‘Total rainfall of 7.5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with potential for up to 25 cm of rainfall’, according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border of Arizona dawn early Tuesday morning as a tropical lprint, which moves forward through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
“The head father expected by Rosa or the rest of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States”, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce deadly floods and floating shrubs in the desert and earthquakes in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack, four arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of attempts to kill, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital, and his condition is supposed to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked anyone who could have a mobile recording of the incident to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “has suffered under the pettyness and mind of the democratic party”
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the democratic party,” Trump said in front of a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has “been suffering under the pettyness and mind of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the Congress on Thursday, and denied the strong and emotional accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford is also witnessed on his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw how brilliant, brilliant and brave” Kavanaugh was that day.
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, with a fine-free public service conduct,” he told a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred discreetly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of the Republicans voting in the intermediate elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of our most important choices of life.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
“This is why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.”
Trump claimed that the democrats have the goal of "resisting and preventing".
The first intermediate vote of the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to what the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party has said to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths of Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed, and many were dragged to sea by huge waves thundering against the beaches when a great earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] of waves thundered in land around sunset, destroyed everything in their way, and drowned many into the death of drowning.
The tsunami came into the heels of a strong earthquake 7.5.
“When the tsunamifare emerged yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach, did not escape immediately and ended up as victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Crisis Management Agency (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami was not alone – it took cars, trees and houses, it hit everything on land,” said Nugroho, and added that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed in trees to escape the tsunami and survived."
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the crisis management body showed many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and crushed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershake continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake line could be identified by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated that the power of Friday’s huge earthquakes was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘inclusive’ and said that thousands of dwellings, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and damages could be the larger country’s coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, nearer the heart of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely crippled, completely without information” from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 30,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross in a press release, and added that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it may become much worse."
On Saturday the board was severely criticized for not informing the fact that a tsunami had met Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building hears crying out desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water rushes toward the beach and rivers buildings and cars.
Reuters have not been able to authenticate the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a massive power break that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun sending transport planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuators still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city airport is only open for aid work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Death rates after the tsunami in Indonesia are rising over 800.
It's horrible.
World Vision's staff from Donggala have come safe to Palu's center, where they have sought shelter under the presenning tent in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
“They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses, ” he said.
It's horrible.
As relief organizations began the sad preparations for emergency aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with great expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until declared as a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we can open the borders of international assistance, but the situation has not been given status yet."
As the sun goes down over Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquakes and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that illuminate the sad news of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was liberated by rescue crews after spending two days trapped under ruins with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglides for the Asian games, which were carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional shoulder to carry, ” he said.
Gendon told me that in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the performers who participated in the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only resulted in grey marks, rather than a couple of blue marks.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal USD 26 750 under minibank filling in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26.750 from a Brink's worker who filled a minibank in Newport on the Leveee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who "run up behind the Brink's staff" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses then more suspects escape from the crime scene, according to the press report, but the police have not specified how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity must contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
The Rapper changes his name to Ye.
The Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
When he advertised the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The project previously known as Kanye West. ”
West (41) has had the nick Ye for a long time and used the name as the title of its eighth album, launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program after she canceled on “emotional basis,” according to the serial maker.
In addition to being a shortening of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – like a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many known rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, previously cooperating with West, has also varied between the use of dash and upper letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's attending president, Andre's Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that “he will never ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, and killed as many as 300 people, during a period when left-country student movements rooted across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education lead young people into criminal gangs.
US should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and performer of artificial intelligence, which has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements regarding artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States in general does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on the other hand, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number one in the innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double financial support can double the chance of the next major performance in artificial intelligence coming from the United States, ” Lee reported in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat the U.S. best Othello player, and later was a director of Microsoft Research or Director of Google Chinese Department.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. government's former technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation's wise heads.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants.
"It's not China who steals the academic leaders, it's the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired wise heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have an artificial degree of intelligence should receive the offer of residence permit automatically,” he said.
China’s State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation finances people at academic institutions, in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are investing more than USD 100 million in research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. Law Office, which aims to establish a National Safety Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has been suspended for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of the country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia in order to resolve a several decades of dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become members of the EU and NATO.
Greece, also with a province called Macedonia, considers the name of the northern neighbor to be a requirement in Greek territory and has set down veto against including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June based on the proposed new nav, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s slave majority population.
President Görge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boikotting campaign has raised doubts about the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the voting note is ‘Are you for NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece’.
Those who support the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to become members of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be crucial because a high enough number of Members have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote.
The change of names requires a two-third majority in Parliament.
The Electoral Commission has said that they had not received any irregularity reports by 13.00.
However, the meeting was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The People's Vote in Macedonia is about changing the name of the country to open the doors to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) clarified a small scene and drew chairs up in front of tents set up by those who are to boikotta the vote.
“We are positive to NATO and the EU, but we want to be reported with an elevated head, not to be let in the back,” says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor land, but we are worthy of it.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries such as China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead the highly needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think most people will be for it because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO,” says Zaev after voting.
He says a 'yes' answer will be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum — this is lower than the required meeting.
Another study carried out by Macedonia’s Telma TV showed that 57 percent of the blacks plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the meeting must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle that the Pro-West Government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers all over Brighton's defense to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crushed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 wins on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculous when he scored a goal for 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran a race with three Brighton defenders before he got out on the open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four vegetables.
He got around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left, reaching Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, which used the right shoe to beat Brighton’s keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems," told the press by the City Manager Pep Guardiola.
“We talked about that he would play 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky he scored a goal right then."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League game.
This target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the death line.
City plays against Hoffenheim in Champions League group game at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a spoiler for Rockies.
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet strong.
The always equally competitive Scherzer still hopes to be on the field on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff possibilities of the Colorado team, which leads over Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card-place with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals Friday night, but is still looking to secure their first division title.
Even if we have nothing to win, at least we can play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to be the highest level of battle I get to play this year.
Why should I not take part in it?"
The Nationals have still not advertised its starting pitcher for Sunday, but will apparently be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games and lost 7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump Public Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred discreetly to the situation around High Court Nomination Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republicans voting in the intermediate elections.
"What we have done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant, and that's why I'm traveling around and fighting for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued “You see this cruel, cruel group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power at all costs, and there you see the pettyness and the badness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have the goal of resisting and preventing.
And he said, "You see it over the last four days," and called the Democrats "slow and evil and disgusting and dishonest."
He referred to the Senate Court Committee and mentioned the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein by name, where the audience bowed loudly.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Um, um, what.
No, about no, I expect one — that was very bad body language — the worst body language I've ever seen. ”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to incite me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last one in a long series of Labour MEPs who have been informed that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of antisemitism.
In my case, I had to be censored because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Concerning the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, of Europe – ironically similar matters that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders on.
On Friday's Nontingham East Labour meeting, it said that 'we want meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
Most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood at many of the meetings, and the promise of "much more friendly" policy is long forgotten if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I once thought I shared many political attitudes with suddenly starting to expect me to take an U-sving and stand for opinions I had never agreed with before, they agreed on the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly — and it doesn’t matter what I say — I receive a bunch of ugly messages on social media that demand my deliberation, condemn center policy, and tell me I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And I'm not the only one who's been through this.
I know I'm happier with some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that sex discrimination and racist comments every day, but never allow themselves to be cowed.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross distinction has been normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the working party should promote a tolerance culture.
The truth is, we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every distrust proposal and every change in the rules of elections becomes narrower.
I have received many advice in the last two years when I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better. ”
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the lack of thatcher government, which had led to my classroom in the public school that I went to literally deceased, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and minister of government.
I've never hidden my political opinions, nor my previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a representative on Friday, I would just like to say that as the country is raging our way towards a Brexit that will harm private individuals, companies and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of deliberation or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best protects your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeseired Ayr rising to the top
Two late attempts have changed the end result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this fantastic entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
They are now at the top of the table, and are the only undefeated of the ten.
Finally, their superior defense was as much as their ability to use the opportunities that led to the loss of the home team, and Coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
“We have been challenged so far in our fights and are still undefeated, so I have to be satisfied with that,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honour to Ayr, they were better at using the opportunities than we were."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, with a target park from Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland Captain Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, allowed Melrose to smooth the position, and Jason Baggot performed an attempt without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's management with a criminal kick before he, just before he paused, scored and targeted a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 on pause.
But Melrose started the second half strong, and Patrick Anderson's attempts, with target kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious harm to Ruaridh Knott, carried out on the stretcher, and from the reboot, Ayr increased the leadership's oath to an attempt by Stafford McDowell, with a target kick from Climo.
Ayr’s operating Captain, Blain Macpherson, then got a yellow card, and Melrose exploited having an extra man on the track to the full with an attempt from Bruce Colvine without target kick, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for having handled Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson accomplished a touchdown by throwing in behind the prominent Ayr maul.
Climo accomplished a goal kick, as he did again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent the flanks Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still The Game Star is ready for a new career in the restaurant business
It seems that the Still Game star, Ford Kieran, is on its way into the servering industry — it was recently discovered that he was named director of a restaurant company with grants.
The 56-year-old is playing Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program for which he writes scripts and plays along with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The pigeon has announced that the coming nineth season will be the last series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the case, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's "lifely restaurant business".
"The sea is ours: Bolivia, a country without the coastline, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
Seamen patrol a riggine-covered Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicacas to Amazon are decorated with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The whole inland state of Bolivia has still freshened in memory the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, and the country longs for once again to be able to sail in the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been in decades, awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has a driving force, a community spirit and a calm mind, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive attitude”, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court on a large screen in many parts of the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give its judgment in favour of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after decades of traced negotiations – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own expiration to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s karismatic native president – who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also put a great deal on Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia’s party and that very little would change if it did.
The United Nations body, as a team in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away chilenic lands and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the judgment of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated”, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia’s case, the last four years may actually have made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonist rhetoric has wiped away any remaining kindness on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative of the Hague, rejected the theory that the Court’s decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile” and the possibility to “set an end to 139 years of disagreement, in favour of both parties”.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, has used the maritime situation as a political shelter.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
"The knowledge is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never destroy its nuclear weapons if they can't trust American authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to observe their promises at a meeting between the two conflicting countries in Singapore.
These comments are coming at the same time as the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to start the locked nuclear diplomatics, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "wanted dream" that continued sanctions and American opposition are statements that end the Korean war will ever force North Korea in the knees.
American authorities are skeptical of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang initiating significant disarmament measures first.
Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have another meeting.
But there is widespread doubt whether Pyongyang really intends to let go of an arsenal country is likely to consider it the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge head coverings, which are headed for a clothing store near you.
If you want some big addition to the hat collection or to hide completely from the sun, you don’t need to search anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne uncovered a selection of strange, overdimensionated headwear as part of their SS19 collision on the catwalk, which impressed the motel vines at Moteuka in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular at Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their striking creations down the catwalk.
Valentino’s most spectacular garment was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a featherlike broad brake that drowned the heads of the models.
Other overdimensionated accessories included jewel - decorated watermelons, a wizard hat, or even a pineapple, but they are not made to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also uncovered a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had reproduced lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation reminded me of diving equipment, including snorkels and dive glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in cookies.
And if you're looking for even bigger fashion accessories, you're lucky.
Stil experts predict that the huge hats may be headed for a clothing store near you.
The overdimensionated hats come straight into the heels of La Bomba, the straw hat with a half meter wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand behind the very impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another great creation down the catwalk — a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the bathing suit model that wears it.
The orange refrigerant box, which is edged with refinery and complete with a white skin handle, was the most striking creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collision at Moteuka in Paris.
Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the grocery stores next summer — when the designer has had such an impact, it will be difficult to overlook the demand for overdimensionated accessories. ”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial to world citizens
Scotland's fresh schools continue to show academic prominence, and this has remained in 2018 with more than one year of excellent exams, supported by individual and common success in sport, art, music and other social activities.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their position as world citizens.
As an educational body capable of designing and implementing a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and demanded choosing subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, his words come to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, his words will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can not just stick to English when we want to build relationships and confidence with people from other countries.
From the results of the year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest percentages of composition from fresh oils.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the grade A.
The data collected from the 74 members’ schools of the free school council showed that 72 percent of students received the grade A in mandarin, while 72 percent of German students 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also received A.
This illustrates the fact that fresh oils in Scotland support foreign language as a decisive skill for children and young people will no doubt need for the future.
Languages as professional elections are now appreciated at the same level as reality as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in schools for fresh oils and other places.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for the reasons of employers’ failure to occupy a vacant position, 17 per cent could be attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a competitive advantage to a multilingual person.
According to a YouGov study answered by more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two - digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why today’s children need to invest in language training.
Knowing more languages, especially those associated with emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most valuable to Britain on the road towards 2020, such as mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose from in fresh schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scotish fresh oils aim to create a learning environment that will prepare and equip their children with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Modern languages should actually be considered “international communications ability”.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and award for Scotland’s young people.
Il faut the bee le faire.

I want LeBron to have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting time is almost over with fans who want to watch LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play is still not decided.
“There will be more than one and less than 48”, said Walton on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-play pre-song plan.
“I don’t need precedent fights at this stage of my career, ” he replied.
Time of Trump's Western Virginia Public Meeting, YouTube Channel
President begins a number of election meetings tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned public meetings in the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote of his elected Supreme Court Candidate has been suspended, Trump has the objective of obtaining support for the forthcoming interdependence elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when the electorate goes to the polls in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia People's Meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, west Virginia will start at 7:00 a.m. tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's public meeting in West Virginia on the web below via direct flowing on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the week's hearings for High Court Nomination Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, and a expected confirmation vote has been suspended for up to one week while the FBI is investigating the case.
The main objective of all these conventions is to support republicians who face a challenging election in November.
Therefore, President Trump has said that these five public meetings in the next few weeks have the objective of “inciting volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while moving towards a busy campaign season”, Reuters heard from a campaign speaker for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening's public meeting, which will take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania," and is covered by the Pittsburgh press, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate Candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a lift to the polls, ” said Simon Haeder, an expert in political science at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows battle spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday's single game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The Momentum’s swinging pendulum is a fully imagined sport concept, yet something the players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
“They led with six points and now there are four, so we carry it with us as a little momentum,” said Jordan Spieth when he left the track for the day.
Of course, Europe wants the advantage – they lead with four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have had a little wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, and leads as an example.
The deep cries of celebration increased as his round continued, and sank to a decisive set to raise the match to a draw when he and Thomas were two down after two.
His putter, who won them the match of 15, was faced with a similar scream — of the kind that shows that he still does not believe that the American team is out of chance.
“We really need to put all the cloths on and focus on our own match,” said Spieth.
That's all each player has now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly Ryder Cup's great success story.
Europe’s unusual but glorious couples have four out of four and do not make a foot mistake.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who avoided a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results, and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd, make it clear that they are the largest competitors of Sunday, and there are no other players the audience will rather see a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Especially both of you at the same time, in each one's hole.
It is still too early to declare Europe to be the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were easily involved with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was partner with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two double during the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede were so far behind that they did not have the chance to catch up.
But on Sunday there's no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look close because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the battle spirit some, especially in the United States, have missed.
Europe leads 10-6 at the beginning of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong precedent at the start of Ryder Cup's last day, after completing the four-ball and foursomes game of Sunday with 10 to 6 leads towards the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the lead with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised their score for Le Golf National so far as four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjørn, who struggles to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unhappy side in the four-balls of the morning and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they couldn't get any of the prep.
Jim Furyk's side has to pick up eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie that has received four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who have been called Molliwood after a sensational weekend – are the only couple who have received four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they collaborated seamlessly to beat down broken Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who halted through two games on Saturday, flashed at times, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested to the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and made a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked as number one and three worldwide.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this warm day with light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fighted 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team managed to get in after a four-point precedent at the start of the single game, but as present holders only need Furyk's side to achieve a draw to keep the trophy.
But after being the second best for two days, they do not seem to be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will 'no way' agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that continued sanctions strengthened the distrust against the United States, and that the country will in no way agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s Annual General Assembly that North Korea has implemented “significant charity measures” during the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and promising not to spread nuclear and nuclear technology.
"We have never seen any similar response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will under no circumstances unilaterally disarmament ourselves first.”
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints against Washington’s resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual downgrading steps, but his statement was significant because it did not completely reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the 'Atomnedrustning of the Korean Peninsula', while Trump guaranteed the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has called for a formal conclusion of the Korean war, which lasted from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
‘The United States insists on ‘the atomic disarmament first’ and raises the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its objective by force, and even opposes the declaration of the end of the war’, according to Ri.
"The belief that penalties can force us in the knees is a dream for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of the penalties creates further distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second hit between Kim and Trump that the American leader stressed before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: “If the other party to this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been as locked up as it is.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's when he told the United Nations General Assembly that an attack on the United States of America with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Herr Ond President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” by North Korea last year, Trump stood before the UN this year and commended Kim for being brave enough to take the disarmament steps, but said that much work remains, and the sanctions must remain in force to North Korea are nuclear down.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a timeframe for this, and said that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced forcefully and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament. ”
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to strap the funding of the Pyongyang nuclear and missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had prospered, but only hours after he was accused of "walking demands".
North Korea committed at a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile area and a nuclear plant if the United States made “equivalent measures”.
He said Kim had said that these “equivalent measures” he wants were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalise the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard are taking a course of rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students to get more sleep by coping with the growing incultural incubation by pouring through the night with caffeine pinks as fuel.
One academic found that the students at the world’s best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he considers to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He started his course after giving a talk about the effect of sleep shortages on learning.
"After the talk, a girl came to me and said, "Why hasn't anyone said this before?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains the importance of good sleeping habits in order to perform academic, sporty, and to the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for university health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw the students suffering from severe sleep shortages.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
One is a picture of a room in a bedroom where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes, books, and learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep shortages and how important a sleep routine is.
In another part, the participants are told how long - term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons makes the participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to pugg all night, he said, and added that modern technology and the growing pressure on students led to an increasing problem of sleep shortages.
Enough and good sleep should be the students’ “secret weapons” against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleep shortages put the brain in a state of hunger, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, taking one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that his course inspired him to work for a course available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students set on an alarm for when to lie down as well as for when to get up and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic monitors and LED lights.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Target of Menga beats out Gerrard's men
Rangers had another loss when Dolly Menga's target hit Steven Gerrard's team 1 to 0 on Livingston.
The Ibrox page wanted to get its first victory since February's victory 4-1 on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's other losses on 18 games as manager and left his eight points from Ladbroke's Premiership Leaders Hearts.
Menga beat to seven minutes before the break, and Rangers never managed to make up for it.
Rangers are now falling into sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind Hibernian on target.
There may be more trouble in the yard for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown out of a distant public.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the team, sweeping past Ayr into the Betfred Cup Seminals.
On the other hand, Holt went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Heart’s last week, and he would have been pleased with how his well - trained team beat the opponents.
Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should've scored only two minutes into the game when Menga's first passing sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's targets, but the middle player played out the chance.
A long frispark of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target bar.
Rangers took control, but it looked like their game was more on the hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he was supposed to have a criminal kick after 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson refused this.
Rangers only succeeded in two shots on targets at first, but former Ibrox Target Liam Kelly didn't get any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis opening for 34 minutes may have been against the game's course, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Once again, Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the pause, and the player exchange gave immediate results when the wing player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran off his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the kind of game they like, as Lithgow and Halkett captured long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacob's before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers' influential Glenn Middleton probably had a late demand for a crime park when he got into conflict with Jacobs, but again, Thomson saw away.
Almanac: the inventor of the geigerteller
And now a page from the Sunny Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, the day the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we today know as the geiger.
The Geigerteller has been an important part of science since then, and became also part of popular culture through the 1950 Bells of Coronado film, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man, "What is it?"
Rogers: “It is a geigerteller; it finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals deliver.’
Evans, "Then there is a sound."
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention he gave his name, it's still alive.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines are learning the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now ‘see’ a protein that is common in many cancers and then be injected in the patient again.
A vaccine during testing has been promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced the disappearance of her ovarian cancer for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory to ‘see’ a protein called HER2, typical of many cancers, and then injecting these cells again in the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results indicate that we have a highly promising vaccine. ”
HER2 “driver growth of different types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, where immune cells were taken from the patient and ‘trained’ to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came with a great defense of Trump after the SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was bowed in a studio on Saturday Night Live after a fabulous performance where he praised the American president Donald Trump and said he wanted to make elections in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he pushed out against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“It happens so often that I speak to a white person, and then he says: ‘How can you like Trump, he is a racist?’
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual abuse presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West was uploaded in social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he heard it in the back room about the choice of headwear.
“They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
They bullied me!
And then they said I don't understand what the reality is," he said, Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see that I understand what the reality is?” he said, “Do you want to put on me the Superman cape, because then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
His comments were bowed at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL looked embarrassed, reported Variety, where a staff member said: “The whole studio became deadly. ”
West was brought in as the last little replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he presented the song “I Love It” dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our braveest: THANK YOU ARE IN THE MASSES. ”
But the talkshow host Karen Hunter twitted that West is just "who he is and it's absolutely amazing".
"But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing or supporting his 'Art') which I believe cultivates and spies out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on, he was “the being formally known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist to change his name and now follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper colleague Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion, and then, of course, it's the dead musical legendary Prince who changed the name of a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

The game of Thrones star Kit Harington is pushing out against "good masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of the sword-winger Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the medieval, Game of Thrones.
But the 31 - year - old actor has gone out to criticize the macho - hero stereotype and says such roles in movies often make young men think they need to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he was very concerned about the theme.
“It bothers me quite much these days — where did the masculinity go wrong? ” he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV may be part of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strong masculine roles.
He said, “What is inborn and what is instructed?
What is being communicated on TV and on the streets, and what makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate just this side of being a man?
I think it is one of the really big questions of our day — how can we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not make any predecessor or successor of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is “finished with battlefields and horses”.
From November Kit will play the main role in a new recording of Sam Shepard True West, this is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so that was something good out of it — my future family and my life from now on, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, which Kit's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy prized imagination series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
Hiv/aids: China reports 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, says the health representative.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China through blood transfusions.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way is now closer to zero, said Chinese health professional at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, year by year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 10,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men having sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the disease is due to insufficient protection by sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, China’s authorities have promised public access to HIV medicine as part of an action to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the leakage of data on Republican Senators, whispers of dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
Member of the Representatives' House, Maxine Waters, rejected Saturday's charges that members of her staff had posted the personal data to three Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democracy of Los Angeles assured of the allegations was made by Ultra Conservative commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more reprehensible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the attacks against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address of the source of the article was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of the Waters staff, according to Hill.
“This unjustified charge is completely incorrect and a regular lie,” continued Waters.
“The members of my staff - who have received their identity, personal data and security compromised by these dishonest and false accusations - had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unjustified accusation is completely incorrect and a regular lie.'
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, among others by former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive," wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temper to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be aggressive.
They can't go to defense.
Do not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They must act calmly.
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the intermediate elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big - if it's true," he twitted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified “relevant authorities and police of these false accusations”.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are held responsible for all destructive and dangerous acts for each of my staff."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again – bloodless Rowan Atkinson in spy parodi
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit performances in all new films with a British look and it seems to be relevant for this resuscitation of the parodifranchisen Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurrected in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfaction about how clearly hopeless we are to become the nation’s new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bubbling eyes and the rubber face has renewed its license to mess it up for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with non-English speaking quinopuinum.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a deck of Mr Bean, and a portion of the guy who contributes with one note in the music feature of the firecare theme during the opening ceremony at the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the role that Atkinson played in the long-lost TV ads of Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's one and another great moment in the last Johnny English tour.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades sneaked his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical commodity comes to its right, but the humor feels quite bloodless and strangely redundant, especially now that the “serious” brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible willingly away have features of comedy.
The humour seems more focused on children than on adults, and for me, Johnny English' fats are not as inventive and spicy as the mute film eyes of Mr. Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super secret web network of spys and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the guardian agent – a sad little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop for a prime minister, a pompous and devastated figure already undergoing a complete crisis of political unopularity: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this like-Teresa-May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work on.
Her intelligence counselors inform that since every active spy has been exposed, she has to bring someone in among the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who is now working as a teacher at a snobbed establishment, but gives unofficial instruction in secret intelligence, and there are some funny sequences here when English offers a rocka Academy for spy activity.
English is being snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, mutilated with a submarine commander, a hysterical lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin style of messing everything up on mission for the queen is back where they confront Olga Kurylenko amazing five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is seduced by the karismatic technology millionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the crooked Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the journey with pediatric sides: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a hot French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so sweet and noisy it is, there's a lot like a child TV with the whole thing.
Pretty moderate, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think, can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets his talent?
Labour denies that they are planning to let the British work for four days but get paid for five days.
The Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party will evaluate a radical plan that will give the British four-day week work – but get paid for five.
The party apparently wants managers to use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra weekly leave.
This will result in a three - day weekend for employees, while receiving the same wage.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to four-day weeks so that workers can also benefit from the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to allow the pendulum to turn to the workers’ benefit – in addition to the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. The Green Party promised four-day week during the campaign before the parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the whole Labour Party does not support the idea.
One spokesman of the Labour said, "A four-day week is not the policy of the party, and is not something that is considered by the party."
Finance policy spokesman of Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of faceless directors and ‘profitors’ of public service providers.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not getting back the entire share item because a Labour government can make a deduction from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the management boards and to set up staff funds to transfer 10 % of the equity to private sector companies to employees, which may receive an annual yield of £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their minds.
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of the Agency's findings may cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked in "60 Minutes" the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I said at the start of the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the accusations came out and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, swift, unequivocal."
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be cut into stone.
“I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and if so, it would have to be a spectacular finding, ” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energetic," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the ones she mentioned could not confirm it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to combating poverty?
This Saturday is the host of the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; to wipe out the world’s poverty.
Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will make thousands of people stream to the great lawn of Central Park, not only to experience sizes such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase consciousness about the real goal of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to fight poverty by making more people work actively against poverty.
In order to obtain a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or "actions", such as voluntary work, send e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call, or in other meaningful ways to increase consciousness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been when there is only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to make people fight for changes, or just another case of so-called "sicktivism" - that people feel that they contribute greatly by signing a online signature campaign or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from supporters, with a wide range of objectives.
They say that these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main exposures are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and gründers based in the UK to “help children to exploit their full potential” and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweeters from the Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice with malnutrition a footnote in history,” told the ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 operations in Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
In answer to one of the common questions on the website, "What makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: “There will be a long and difficult way – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-aparteid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - the Minister of Interior
Washington may ‘if necessary’ turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including in the Middle East, revealing the U.S. Minister of Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s engagement in Syria — especially when operating at the invitation of the legal government — is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flag of Europe,” he should have said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to handle this.
“The United States has the opportunity through the Navy to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blockers to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal organisation that profiles itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran and noted that they are far on the way.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel’, he said and referred to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a tour to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and they want to replace Russia, the very cheapest alternative for European consumers.
Therefore, colleagues of the Trump Administration, including the President himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project The North European Gas Trail 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the Moscow "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unrighteous competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has faced opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have serious problems with third countries intervening in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the leader of BDI after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to think seriously about his presidential candidate for 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts.
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would “think seriously” if she wanted to make a presidential candidate after the middle elections.
During a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed her willingness.
“It is time for women to get to Washington and fix the broken government, and it includes a woman on top,” said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'd like to think seriously about whether I'm going to make a presidential candidate."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump at the electorate meeting and said that he "took the country in the wrong direction."
“I’m worried all the way to the margin about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need a FBI review before voting."
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that she should set up in 2020.
58% of 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the Senator should not stand up, according to a poll from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidate.
The opinion survey showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidateship and 48% opposed it.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed in connection with a possible candidateship in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin points up Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after arriving in Sept.
He was arrested and charged for a home violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with him, ” she told the audience at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about the son and other veterans of war: "They come home a bit changed, they come home hardened, they come home and they wonder if this is the respect for what their soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged for domestic violence on a woman, clustering with a report on home violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla police.
18 Länder and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support a legal trial of a new policy in the United States which refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang or home violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and D.C. provided information from the Amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. The trial of the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that her partner “and his violent gang members” abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States as nations who have extensive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the appeal court of immigrants who gave undocumented immigrants who fled from home power permission to apply for asylum.
Advocate General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy is “aside from many decades of state, federal and international law”.
‘Customs law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle,’ said the information provided by amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the information that policy that refused immigrants access, damages the US economy and says that there is a great probability that they will grow and “suppose the necessary labour force.”
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims who flee from home violence and gang violence in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave the homeland due to persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view,’ said the Sessions in the declaration of 11 June on policy.
Asyl was never meant to reduce all problems – even all serious problems – that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperated rescue action in Palu — doubled death rates in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation became worse and worse.
“It was very excited, ” says the 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, while comforting her feverish son at a evacuation center in Palu.
"All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
Pure water is lacking.”
One could see residents who came to ruined homes and searched through water - damaged possessions in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals injured in the earthquake with strength 7,5 were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are sitting outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoorly because of ongoing severe postquakes.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shaked the hotel room in the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We had no time to save ourselves in safety.
I was squeezed by the wall that collapsed, I think," told Haris to the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to participate in a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of ‘attacking’ with ‘propaganda announcements’
A week after a public Chinese newspaper was driving a four - page ad in an American newspaper that beautifully painted the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China claimed Beijing to use the American press to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the China Daily annex to move into the Des Moines registry — the most selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections on November 6, China’s accusation rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to influence the elections in the United States marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said the U.S. officials, according to Reuters.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to use advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new tariff rates on each other’s import goods.
China’s penalties early in the trade war were to affect export holdings in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, reports Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador in China, and formerly many - year governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has struck American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading post in the Sunday Des Moines Register: "China is now stepping up the harassment by driving propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities exploit the freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to insert a paid ad in Des Moines Register, ” Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast, ” he wrote, “by the street newspaper in Beijing, you will not find many deviating opinions and will not experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media are under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers rejected the offer to publish” his article, although he did not disclose what newspaper it was.
Republicans scare off female electorate before the interference with the Kavanaugh Fades, warn analytics.
Since many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend Supreme Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will receive a counteraction, especially from women, in the coming local elections.
The emotions around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to proceed with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of State Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said that these things cannot be withdrawn to The Hill.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for an FBI investigation in the last second will be enough to relieve angry voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November”, said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators sang “November is coming!” while demonstrating in the halls of the Senate when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee chose to move on with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it has already been high, it is true.
But it could be higher, especially among women's insecure voters in the suburbs and younger choosers between 18 and 29 years, who often do not vote even though they dislike the president."
Even before Ford’s public witness giving a detailed description of the charges of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analytics felt that it would be a counterreaction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
“This has become a happy root for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not only about the committee’s vote or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh is being introduced – it’s also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” pointed out Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group promoting the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the wake of Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41% of the questions were entirely or quite convinced of Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were entirely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh's production.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or entirely convinced that Kavanaugh was lying under his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After the playoff from Flake, the FBI has been investigating the claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh, in a drunken state, was in charge of her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court Candidate exposed her genitals to her while they were at a party during the study at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology doctor's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where to store their data and which persons have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal data storage online” or a POD.
It may include contact lists, working lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available on one web browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data storage online is that it is up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it "Personal Authorisation through Data".
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company will provide resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers on contract to work with the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week onward, technology developers around the world can establish their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely recalculated overnight.
We do not ask for your permission.
In an article on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee stated that Inrupt’s “ mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important vote in the debate on online neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic with regard to the next epoch of the network, ” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Celebrating Victoriakors Recipient from World War I
The only priest in the Church of England who was assigned a Victoriakors during World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann were awarded the honour of September 29, 1918 at the battle in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he was assigned to the highest British military award.
A memory stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a "good symbolic" in that the stone was to be exposed exactly 100 years after the grandfather's prize winning achievement.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Water led its battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns”.
Later, he rushed to the fireline and led the line “with great courage” forward before storming a field cannon independently and knocking out three of the departments.
Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the grandfather’s actions were “what I knew I could never live up to but something that makes me humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said that “he felt very honored to play a role in the parade” and added:“The loss of a true hero is demonstrated by the support of many people.”
MMA fans were up all night watching the Battle Sports Program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig.
Imagine that you've stayed awake all night to see the tightly packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you won't see the main fight.
The participant from San Jose survived 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was shown directly through the night in Britain at Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were seated at the moment the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to watch the battle.
A supporter described on Twitter the transition to the child program as “a kind of sick joke”.
“It is government regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programs at 6:00, so they had to switch to child programs”, said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior Vice President for Marketing and Communication, when asked for the transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes!"
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the broadcasting plan to include the viewers in Great Britain in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the rematch," said Coker.
"But it is at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there, and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe with -- when we switched over, many messages went forward and back, and they were not exactly of the kind sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five matches — which we usually send — and we tried to stretch far to the supporters but tipped over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
The Olympic stump Tom Daley said he grew up with a feeling of inferiority toward everyone because of his sexuality — but that gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it wasn't until in high school he realized that "he wasn't like others."
In the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual program manager of the traditional program, Kirsty Young, should be gone for a few months due to disease.
Daley fremsto, a little lost on the Laver's first transmission and said he felt “less worth” than all the others he grew up with because “it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls.”
He said, "To this day, these feelings of being inferior and different have been the real motivation and have the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he “was something, ” he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He's two-time bronze winners in the Olympics and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador, using his participation in the year's Association in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands up because he feels lucky that can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man - movie maker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you suffer so much at such a young age” – he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar up and downtures.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole perspective" his had been changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I had to win a gold medal, ” he said.
"You know, there are greater things than golden medal in the Olympics.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at a age of 40 after diagnosing brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had obtained tickets to London in 2012 — since he wanted to sit on the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit on the first row,” he said.
“I kept his hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he wasn’t invincible, ” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in OL 2012 and won bronze.
“I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to bounce in front of a homepublic under the Olympics, the best feeling ever, ” he said.
It also inspired his first song choice, Proud of Heather Small, which meant much to him in his drive before the Olympics and still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formswake Mickelson taken to the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for impressive 12th time, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's four-ball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he had so often been for the United States, the five-time major winner shares the day between being a cheerleader and working his game on the rank in hopes of rectifying what scratches.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of the career, and is not in perfect form of the tight Le Golf National Trail, where the long rough area continues to punish lost battles.
And if the track itself is not scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth fight on Sunday, the British Open Master Francesco Molinari himself, who has joined the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their fights this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s game may prove to be crucial.
Fury expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a clapp on my back, and put his arm around me, and said he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
He has great confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these layers before, and this week.
I guess I didn't see him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fallo's record for most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Fury said his participation added some intellectual values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, and likes to make fun of others; he’s a great guy to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives much more than just the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjørn knows his great leadership can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant lead at the entrance to the last day’s single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the curry attained the victory with the least possible margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Björn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 winning 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on that team that this is not over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bear is very pleased with how his players have done on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t do better.
Tomorrow's a new challenge.
Tomorrow it's the individual performances in the center, and there's something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golfer is tested to the full.
It's the message you have to convey to the players that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bear, the opponent Jim Fury will try to make his players do better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the major revolutions last day, he was in the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed the "miracle of Medinah".
I remember every damn word of it,” he replied to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had messed up with his players at the entrance to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to have a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts great pressure on the middle battles.
We'll arrange our setup then and send out the people the way we feel.
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top battle, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the play order.
“I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way,” said Bear about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warships delayed once again
The German Navy's latest fregate would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it will not happen until the early next year due to defective systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the driving ship of the brand new fregates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit quoting a military spokesperson.
The ship was supposed to have been delivered to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered back in 2007, will replace the old fregates of the Bremen class.
They are agreed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to apply the latest fregates for up to two years from the home port.
Still delays mean, however, that the advanced warships — they were told to give Germany strength on the sea — will already be outdated before they are put in service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125-fregate created headlines last year, when German marine officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the causes of return, but the German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware defects" which made the warship useless in a battle mission.
The software defects were particularly important since ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older fregates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has an enormous overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the marine’s prospects for upgrading in the future.
The 7000 tons heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price label for the entire project — including the training of the crew — has become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached EUR 3.1 billion — from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new fregates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s marine force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Government's Defense Committee, confirmed that the Navy actually "is empty of useable ships".
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships were out of range, but no new ship came.
He's sorry that none of the fregates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
National Trust steals the secret life of the bats
New research carried out by a country property in the Scottish Highland will reveal how bats use the landscape in the hunting of food.
There is hope that findings will throw new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help develop future conservation measures.
The study for researchers at National Trust for Scotland will follow regular bats and dwarf flager mice as well as brown lance and water flager mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track bat activity through the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using handheld detectors.
Experts' audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and the species that do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be prepared to produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Environmental Advisor, hopes that the results will identify the areas of the habitat that are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the establishment of pastures and the best care of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and Britain has declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work affecting breeding sites and restriction of habitats.
Wind mills and lighting may also pose a risk, the same with fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials and hut tax attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than for their eyes to catch prey.
They use advanced echo locations to find insects and obstacles on the road when they fly.
The NTS, responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of lands around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skillful experts who regularly carry out studies, surveys of breeding places, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization also established Scotland’s first and only own bat reserve at Threave country property in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here on Threave we have a perfect area for bats,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other property will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of mapping the bats before maintaining a property, since unconscious destruction of a single breeding place can kill up to 400 females and young people, perhaps destroying a whole local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or destroy their breeding places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to help in the work.
She says: “We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many species, we simply don’t know how the populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers will sue German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against himself as "false news" and says that people "want fame" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He's accused of paying her $375,000 afterwards for keeping the incident quiet, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as “false news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, says five times the Goldball wins into the camera.
"They want fame by using my name.
It's normal.
They want fame by giving me my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," adds the soccer player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the claims, which they have called “an unacceptable production of suspicions in the private sphere”, according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the soccer player will require compensation for “judicial damage to an extent equivalent to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years. ”
The alleged event is supposed to have taken place in June 2009 on a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are supposed to have gone back to the football player's room, where he supposedly raped her analt, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was "99% a good person" which was betrayed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later they made settlements outside the court because she was “frightened of revenge” and was also concerned about “being publicly hung up. ”
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to put the settlement aside because she's still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of going from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the supposed assault, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus at a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Britain “will grieve forever” over losing car manufacturers
United Kingdom “will mourn forever” if they lose their world lead status in car production after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “anxiety” that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed borderpassing at any Brexit without agreement could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will, in my view, experience that production at our factory stops,” said Marvin Cooke, President of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement as to how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they're gonna shut down the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what car manufacturers say is supply chain risks of any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of ‘order as needed’ and it arrives every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a stay at the border, which the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's stocks at the Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that the Theresa Mays Brexit plan for further relations with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such checks at the border”.
“We have to have an agreement. We want to have the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy success at the moment, but to take this opportunity,” he said on the BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also other car manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that increased costs in the long term will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that the members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience says that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein may be “extended another week” while the battle around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, relations between Trump assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to the law enforcement of the President.
The question about Trump will dismiss the Minister of Vice Justice or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has been numb for months during the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording the conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Constitutional Plugin.
Rosenstein denied the information.
Last month, however, he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to volunteer.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York City, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said "better to let go" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoiding the conflict with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of the witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, took part in Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week of delay because of everything that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always concerned with keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10th.
I'm sorry, but Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to the resentment of the TV reporters 'self-benefit', although she added: 'I do not disagree with their self-goodness'.
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
“The President is more questionable than any former president,” she said and added without evidence: ‘We have looked at the figures’.
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but “if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to make it happen often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open gatherings or press conferences at the visit of important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause when he was performing a solo race and at times had a strange behavior in front of a number of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS (State Health Service) to express the country's gratitude and a desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish parliamentary member, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for residence and work permits for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Contests between the United Kingdom and the EU on announcement have taken place throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So I would like to repeat now how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and outside, add valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work for health services for the benefit of the patients and local communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we hope you will stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes urgent surgery after head injury
Defense player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent urgent surgery after having had a head injury during Saturday 31 - 27 losses to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ in the Tennessean newspaper.
The main coach of Tennessee States, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coachs and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and brought him back for further investigation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV, Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘not yet available information on the type/scope of the injury’ and the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second - year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five tacs Saturday before he ended the game, which totals 18 charges for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in Britain. According to new Tory plans, the additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters.
Document fee increase will be demanded from those who do not pay tax in Britain
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase up to £120 million a year — to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in Britain — and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's plan to attract young people, escorting to offer reasonable housing and strike high-income groups.
The tax increase will be charged to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will strengthen the government's efforts to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The surplus — which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher tax imposed two years ago on housing number two and rental housing purchases — may be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by people not living in the UK, which increases prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot in the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become “spiritous cities ” because of the many foreign buyers who are mostly staying outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson made proposals to reduce the document fee to help more young people own their own home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject quotas on reasonable housing to solve the UK's "disgusting housing policy".
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a spectacular series of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unjustified drafts.
He also wants to give municipal governments greater power to build new dwellings.
May said: “I said last year that I would devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream — that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create themselves a life here.
However, it may not be as simple for people who do not live in Britain as well as for foreign companies to buy dwellings as it is for hardworking British citizens.
For very many people, the dream of own dwelling has become far too distant, and the unworthy situation for the homeless remains."
Jack Ross: "My final objective is to lead Scotland."
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42 - year - old shooter enjoys the challenge of resuscitating the Northeast club, which currently holds a third place in the League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and it was," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland on Hampden as a child, and there is always something that pulls me back.
However, that possibility would only come if I succeeded in the club management.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief says he was not worried about following such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured whether I can get the club back to the Premier League."
Based on the structure and faculties of this club, they are undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'm probably just gonna consider myself to have succeeded here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in the lead for three years, after a period of deputy boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month short performance at Heart's coach.
Then he helped Alloa to return from the downward to the third division and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the downward to win the championship next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the game career of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a proper separation," he remembers when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought that management was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, created a reasonable income and experienced some fine highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management feels quite right to me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable I've known throughout my adult life."

Perfect time for a half-litre is 17.30 on Saturdays, shows a study
The summer heat wave has strengthened the income of the hard - pressed pubs of Britain, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubes and bars experienced a sales increase of 2.7% in July – while revenue for restaurants fell 4.8%, shows the figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant CGA, summarized the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup, July followed a pattern similar to the previous month of June, when pubs rose 2.8%, except for restaurants being hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurant sales in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger equal to-like than the restaurants went down.
The sun was also difficult to provide with, even though it was not as dramatic as for the rastaurant drivers.
It seemed that people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, turnover increased by 6.6 % that month, with food service decreased by 3 %.»
Paul Newman, analytic of the RSM hotel and restaurant industry, said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and large sports and social events are still the main factors for sales on the outside market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups are still in trouble, and a drop in turnover of 4.8% in year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-serving establishments, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a long-term breathing space.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the upheaval of new trade marks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, business sales manager for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of £9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
One in five children — some only 11 years of age — has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study with 20 000 high school students revealed pages with ‘fake Insta’.
The news has increased the concern for sexual sharing.
20 % of the students said they have a "primary account" which they show to their parents.
One in five children — some only 11 years old — creates accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A study with 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in ‘fake Insta’ accounts — a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has increased the concern for sexual content sharing.
20% of the students said they had an innocent "primary account" which they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “ rape me. ”
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the principals' conference (HMC) for private schools revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said, “It is scary that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the Voice of the Liberty Actors on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics and has a non-exercising role in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most decorated sportsman in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her extensive international experience over the last ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide sports environment, and we are sure that sportsmen in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am excited to act as a vote for athletes, and I hope I have much to contribute to guide sports in Scotland.”
The American won 200 and 400 meters under the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four Olympics, and she's now a BBC expert, and after she had a transient ischaemic attack, she couldn't walk.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will show me whether I want to be restored and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm fine again and I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing flexible exercises!
Thank you for all the reassuring messages.”
Breast Pump Ads that compare mothers with cows divide opinions on the Internet
A breast - pump company has divided opinions on the Internet with an ad that compares breast - feeding mothers with milked cows.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent chest pump carried close to the body,” Elvie, the technology-based consumer company, published a fresh and flirting, music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom of the new pump to active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows for a song with among other things the following text: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you didn't understand it, this is not law, it's my boobs."
The corn continues: “Push it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls.”
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say the beauty painter the "grunesses" in the dairibransch.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth, ” one wrote.
Elvie chest pump gets nice space in a breast-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Absolutely traumatic to both mother and baby.
But hey, why not use them to advertise for a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added, "What a misunderstood ad."
Others defend the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I was still breast-feeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers pumping (often at work or toilets) and feeling like cows.
This is not an ad that honours or judges the dairibran.'
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cords or snakes and has a fine place in a breast-bh, so that women get freedom to move, keep the baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and milk cows, we wanted to put search lights on breast pumping and all the challenges, while displaying in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom of the new pump.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a two - year - old mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border secretly
The number of arrested migrant children has gone into the air even though the monthly crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because hard rhetoric and politics introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children with support players.
Traditionally, most supporters have been undocumented immigrants themselves and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by stepping up and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household had to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs authorities, witnessed to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of persons seeking to be a support player for single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 % of the persons who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to persecute these people," says Albence.
The officers try to handle their children more quickly and introduce new rules that indicate that some of them have to meet in court within one month of arrest, not 60 days as the previous standard, according to recipient workers.
Many will be produced through video conferences instead of personally meeting up to conduct their case of residence for an immigration judge.
Those considered unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in custody, the higher the risk of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to receiver workers and reports that have been reported in the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns have grown by a larger plant such as Tornillo, where children who struggle more easily are overlooked because of the size of the plant.
They added that the transfer of children to the tent camp without sufficient time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can enhance traumas that many already are struggling with.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish 'employment powers' to withdraw immediately
In a talk at the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, although the war in the country is now within its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Minister of State, said that the foreign forces were illegal in Syrian soil under the cover of combating terrorism and “will be treated accordingly”.
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on the run.
He said that Damascus will continue “to carry this sacred battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories” both for terrorist groups and“all foreign presence”.
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and advice of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - stricken country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused “some Western countries” of“squeezing irrational flight” that causes the refugees to stay away.
“We have approached the international community and humanitarian organizations to organise these returns,” he said.
They police what is really a humanitarian situation."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defence position of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press on for political conversations.
The Russian/Turkish agreement prevented a large scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed the hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, which “will be eliminated”.
The UN Agent Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon he will be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and oppositional members to prepare a postwar base for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem provided for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to the review of the articles of the present Constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win another period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-election by 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope for, national law and scandal will end the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic conclusion of a presidentship ever! ”
At the moment, there's no sign of seating.
Since 2014, the best broadcast time views have doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time, up to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen. The MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show has topped the cable seer numbers with a total of 3.5 million viewers in evenings with big news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because we do not understand anything,” said Neal Baer, head of the ABC drama “Designed Survivor”, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a recognized comedy maker and writer of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, ” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told him to vote on Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course — unlike anything else on TV — the actions that are taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reconciled and health to the global economy.
Dismissal is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened person when you sit six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep diving in background" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with strutsfjerds worth $15,000 (a plaque spiked with hybris", said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh ..., anatomi.
At least I don't want to look at Super Mario in the same way anymore.
“Something he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, day-to-day manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of “Pawn Stars”, about the Trump show’s varied role crew and daily twist on the plot (clashes with NFL, shamed Kim Jong-un).

When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27 °C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he bured himself in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't break himself loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court of the United States.
“I remember when we made all the crazy programs in the old days and people said that this is the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the regular interdependencies of the Representatives' House.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a stream of money after a congressional district that ended up fighting two seated representatives for the same seat.
This recently drawn suburban district in Pittsburg is with the democratic representative Conor Lamb — who won his seat in another district in a supplication election last spring.
Lamb confronts another seated representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who at the moment represents the 12th district of ancient Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the 17th district.
The map was resumed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were a constitutional manipulation of the constituent constituents in the favor of the Republicans.
The elections in the new 17th district have led to an explosive race for campaign financing between the largest party financing groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a scarce victory in a closely followed election of the 18th district of Pennsylvania to the Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given a small leadership to the Democrats.
The United States considered criminal action against El Salvador for aid to China, followed by the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team to Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw the U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan, ” said Heather Nauert, the minister’s spokesperson, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, an estimated $ 140 million in American aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a summit conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar collection last year considered as a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
By mid - September, however, officials of the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now commanded to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, to show the importance of the administration adding to the collection, said the diplomat.
And the three American messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new tough messages or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman at the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials of the United States, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations under the precondition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next nail in the coffin may be special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to law enforcement, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also supposed to be expanding the investigation into whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in interference with our elections.
If Congress were to change side, Trump would be held responsible in that body, in the middle of the preparation to meet the voters again and perhaps finally a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not mean to claim that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor to his counterparts in Europe.
Choice must be made of all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovakians at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath.
The course of history is circumventing such waves, and the irreversible March of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are faced with several of these swinging points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in heavy weather ever since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret interceptions of the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recent FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the intercom of a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail because of the experiences I got in Prague.
My mother was a Czech echoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in certainty that victory over the Austrians after the impressive residual struggle in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European Liga.
A knee wound prevented the middle-level player Graham Dorrans from doing his first performance for the season in the residual match 2-2 against Vilarreal, but he thinks the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get bigger things.
“It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We entered the game and thought we could get something and got one point.
Maybe we could have nicked in at the end, but a draw was probably a fine result.
They were probably better at first, and we came out in second round and were the best team.
Thursday will be another big night in Europe.
We're hoping for three points, but it's gonna be hard because they had a good result in the last fight, but with homepublic in the back, I'm sure we can get on and get a positive result.
Four years were absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can get on now, put the last season behind us and get it done."
Women lose nightsleep because of the fear of retirement saving
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they do nothing to make that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Activities.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not tell them what you want in good time in advance.
Discuss with the advisor and the family where and how to provide care, since such choices can be of great importance to determine the cost.
Include your financial adviser: The counselor can also help you to find out how to pay your expenses.
The funding options for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance police with cash value to help cover these expenses or self-assurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Work out your legal documents: Remove legal problems immediately.
Get a medical authority in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that health workers will respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving authority to someone over your economy.
You choose a trustworthy person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Write the details in an overview so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that is at stake – who are the doctors? ” asked Martin.
“What medicines do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that overview in place.”

The victim didn't see the assaulter.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have wanted witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the mortality rates are expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Donggala regentship, a region north of Palu near the epicenter of the earthquake with strength 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and the tsunami.
Donggala is a government that stretches over 300 kilometers of coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The government, an administrative region below the province level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the bars of the central province of Sulawesis economy, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamies several times over the last 100 years, according to the Indonesia Emergency Administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Firering in the Pacific and regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A heavy earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of heavy earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A strong earthquake 6.8 hit south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: A strong earthquake 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the Province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A strong earthquake 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that ravaged dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A grunt earthquake hit Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while man was reminded of the mortal earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by coinciding buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested after charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Governor of Alaska and Vice President Candidat Sarah Palin, has been arrested after a murder charge.
Palin, 29 years of age from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, clustered with a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he's supposed to have taken the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
The Palin is being detained in Mat-Su custody and arrested for an unsafe debt letter worth $500, reported KTUU.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, absolute" when he was asked how he responded to the guilt question, reported the network.
Palin is confronted with three class A offences, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and put a fine of $250.000.
He has also been accused of a violation of class B, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time you've been prosecuted against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case will be brought to Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, clustering with the report on domestic violence, and holding a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His boyfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after connecting her son's violent behavior to PTSD after service in Iraq.
Indonesia quake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The strong earthquake 7.5 triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social media showing the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami thundered across the beach.
Federal Prosecutors rarely seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City.
Federal Prosecutors in New York City seek the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York, who killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, apparently used a Home Depot rental car to perform an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he melted down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutor must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “deliberately” and caused serious physical damage intentionally, according to the warning of intention to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these items qualify for possible death penalty under the document.
Several weeks after the assault, a federal high-level jury threw the 22-point stand, including eight indictments for murder in connection with blackmail, in the face of Saipov, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge for the violence and rejection of vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and intention,” said the prosecutor, who described the way Saipov carried it out as “happy, cruel and corrupt.”
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal damage, property creations and losses for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, provides the intentional warning.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the last time the Southern District of New York took a case that could give death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York City, in 1953, for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, Uzbekistan, showed no regret in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the detectives that he was pleased with what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on his cell phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He did not declare himself guilty after the charge of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the officially appointed defenders of Saipov, said that they were “deplorable” over the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma of these events for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the army of the people” today during a demonstration at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that the politicians would get “feel pressure” from the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he be responsible for the negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative back-bencher Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that Britain “will have been devastated” now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile his deeply divided ranks has been stressed by pro-Remain Tories who participated in their own demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on the track of attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would go on trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the relapse – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "caos".
Bone told the "Reporting" demonstrants in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and had the responsibility of the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I'll be on it for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit plan."
When he was to explain his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone refrained from claims that the public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is totally wrong."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Broxit plan is unpopular in the public; the opposition will not vote for it; it is unpopular in the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who bust the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening.”
In a direct message to May, she added: "Ministers of State keep the job when they keep their vows."
Farage stated that the politicians would get “feel pressure” if they were thinking of betraying the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“This is now about trust between us — the people — and that politicians, ” he said.
"They try to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know that they will not get away with it."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the edge to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilise the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governmental, proud Britain.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before having a two - hour political assembly in the center of the city.
A small number of activists waving with Tories Against Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland”, he added.
"It is a complete father.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren seriously considers being a presidential candidate.
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she will “evaluate seriously to make a presidential candidate” after the election in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democracy of Massachusetts spoke of the future during a council meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is re-electioning in November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, Vice-President of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been central to the speculations if she's going to face Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electorate, who has used the town house format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she was planning to make a presidential candidate.
Warren replied that it is time for women to get to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman on top.
Arrest station after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting.
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting incident that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died as a result,” said Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the spot with a gun, and he admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without upheaval and put in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police chamber.
Sims was a two-metre high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russian Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton aims at the World Championship after stablelords give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stablelords would play a big role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and swept almost Hamilton off the track while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel ran into the depot first and let Hamilton continue driving in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up for some pushing with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver reluctant to leave the inside free after a double pass to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in as the seventh at the end of his first round on his 21th anniversary.
Then, in large parts of the race, he was lying on the wheels to try to get to a quick end and overcome the number four Kimi Raikkon.
Finally, he came to the 44rd round depot, but he failed to increase the speed of the remaining eight rounds, and the Raikkon took the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me through.
The team has done a magnificent job to get a good fool," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her holding that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court Advocate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Judgment Committee, but he commented on the fact that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are “evil, horrible and false.”
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and mean and horrible and speak falsely," he said.
"When you look at extraditions and leaks, they say, "Oh, I did not.
I have not done it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not leaked.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't leak," he added, with an imitation of the Senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information on the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein refused that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her denial was not graciously addressed by the president, who during the Saturday evening party event commented: “I will tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court Candidate, accused of three women’s sexual abuse, the president suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
"They have decided to take back the power with all the necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two targets for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants was given a two-six-six-shooting mission from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie remedyed for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of Giants.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two cases by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season of Adam Keefe's men who had come back after they hit Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
It was the third meeting for the season between the teams, and Giants had won the three previous battles.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford opened the game when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to Cownie's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants had the lead on pause when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again compensated with a mastery goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the second round of the battle, and he secured the victory with the team's five halfway out in the final round.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escape earthquakes
An Indonesian flight leader is hylled as after he died and ensured that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershakes continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly sweeping control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway right then, could safely light.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Advocate for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Calimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard it," he added.
The government fears that the number of deaths can rise to thousands, and the National Disaster Warrant Agency reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
“The figures are expected to rise further as many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been possible to reach,” said the spokesman of the organ, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six feet [6 m] of waves have ravaged Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
There's a lack of clean water.
The Mini Markets are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross works febrilically to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and told the country military: “I ask you all to work day and night to do all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?' reported CNN.
Indonesia was affected by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after a plane crashed in Lagune
The airline that owned the plane crashing in a lagoon in the Pacific, Micronesia, now reports that one man is missing, reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the falling plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that every Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they didn't have a record of.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the state of all were stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane missed the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade through middeep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flyers were panicking and screaming and that he had a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a pier, also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to carry people into land before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG registered aircraft in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analytics present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors closed the procedure on Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Analytics at the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for hours as experts in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to bring together the movements of 29 - year - old prosecuted Quinton Tellis and the 19 - year - old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he picked up localization data from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, which struggled with what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers' cell phone when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the testimony on Saturday and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer of Sanford that night, Sanford said that he was "for lying because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints suggest that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Telli's calls, contact details, and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
Defence shall begin its procedure on Sunday, as planned.
The judge said he expected the case to be abandoned to the jury later that day.
The High Breed, what is societal engasjert hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image to the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from the origin of political messages to address social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make socially engashed hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new ascension in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York Child Care Couples are suing for termination after "racist" message
A babysitter in New York sues a couple for discrimination after receiving an error message from the mother, complaining that she was “only a black person”.
The couple reject their racistity and compare the case with extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to the first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEII END A SVART PERSON", wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistake, it was a “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman who resigned Maurice by claiming that their dismissed childcare, a African, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one day of work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the resignation and demands compensation in the amount of $350 a day for the six - month - long housing arrangement she was promised, but without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hello, you just don’t,” she said to New York Post on Friday, and added, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have resisted the charges that they are racist and say the resignation of Maurice was the only right thing, since they felt that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something that she hadn’t meant to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"Would you leave your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on.
The comparison of the case with blackmail says Plasco was due to the fact that his wife had only two months to terminate and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Is there such a person you want to punish?
It is not very nice,” added the share broker.
While the legal case is taking place, the public court has been quick to condemn the social media couple and criticize them for their conduct and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says that the father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a small cloth bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book release was “bitter sweet” after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father was secretly very proud of his success.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was no boastful person," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you had a child doing a good thing: you are proud of it even though it is not really your fault.
I think he viewed Paddington's success a little like that.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he used to give the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
On landing, the daughter was hurried to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked bad, that he didn’t think she would survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the phone from Nad, who said she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be right there.
I'll come to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to cause her heart to beat, slowly lost its effect, and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body clapped together.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it happened.
I couldn't scream and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers — who did not know about the trials she was undergoing.
"No one knew," she says.
"I looked down all the time, and the tears ran in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards with grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed and killed when he was 18 years old.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day, ” she says.
45 - year - old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"All knew him on the smile.
They said his smile could light up any room."
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother was one of the ones who found him after he killed himself.
Sharon says, "I'm always worried that it's going to be an infectious effect."
Sharon laid the cards “to tell people that there are people out there to talk to, even though there is only a friend.
Don't sit for yourself. You need to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon’s friend for many years, lost Mark, his partner through 15, shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t tell me he felt depressed or depressed or something, ” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed the changed mood.
The first Christmas day he was in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas presents, they didn't get eye contact or anything.”
She says that his death was a great trauma to them, but they must fight through it: "There is a huge hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we all have to endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is hanging in a thin thread while the FBI starts examining.
“I thought that if we could get some of the things he asked for – a time- and extent-limited review – we might be able to reach a certain agreement,” said Flake on Saturday, and added that he feared that the Committee “fall apart” along locked party limits.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The resentment was due to timing.
The intermediate elections are only five weeks away, November 6 — if the Republicans are likely to be doing bad things, it will be much harder for them to have the man they want elected to the Supreme Court in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators and operated lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and met her wife Ashley there when she was a personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI delivers his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where at the moment there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double voice and get him in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean jumpers falls under Kim
The number of North Korean jumpers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which refers to data from the South Korean Ministry of Collection, said that there had been 1127 jumps last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't commented publicly.
Most skippers from North Korea are offered nationality in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border towards North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarised zone between the two Korean states.
China views the jumpers as illegal migrants, not refugees, and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South — which technically still is in war — has improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for conversations on the denuclearisation debates.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. penalties for lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally rust first,” said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in an interview on Saturday during Texas Tribune Festival, Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had acted like this, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate’s Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had committed sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost shouting and weeping when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats of the Committee and called the allegations against him a "grotesc and coordinated character killing" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he cannot sit in the Supreme Court since it shows that he is prejudged against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh in court if he was approved and if the Democrats were given the majority of the Representatives' house.
“I want to say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court in which he is now, ” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (removal rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the question, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he wanted to review certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to handle it.
It is a righteous anger, months, and years when the anger takes over, and she cannot get it out without weeping.
"We weep when we are angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so strange, do you?"
She continues: “I received good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she is also crying when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and began crying, she said to the person she spoke to, “You think I may be sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought that was amazing."
Tears are allowed to expire partially because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man - dominant office, and I began crying with unexplained rage and was caught in the neck collar by an older woman — a cool boss that I had always been a little afraid of — who dragged me to a staircase.
"Let them never see you cry," she said.
They do not know that you are angry.
They'll think you're sad and happy because they managed to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he served as presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to cheating on his spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the elections, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing wrong in investigating the possibility of making a presidential candidate himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision, ” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it "Snow white and the seven dwarfs."
Since it was close to the end of the campaign, she left behind with the funding and swore she wouldn't stand up if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the support players who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount, or?" she wonders.
When she gave her speech to announce that she did not want to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings — gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration to the system that made it so difficult to drive money and reach electorate instead of delegates, as well as anger over sexism — that she collapsed in tears.
“You would think that I had a nervous breakdown, ” Schroeder recalls how the press referred to her.
"You should think that Kleenex was my chief sponsor.
I can't believe what they'd write on my tomb pillar.
"She wept?"
How the Trade War USA-China Can Benefit Beijing
The opening ointments of the trade war between the United States and China were deaf, and even though the struggle is far from over, a division between the countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, says experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by adding customs to important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminium.
The most important escalation this week took place with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, which means the tax of half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Of course, Beijing has repaid every time, now at the latest with five to ten percent on American products worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the U.S. attack for attack, and the world's second largest economy will probably not lift the white flag at first.
Making Washington downstairs means giving in to demands, but public subordination to the United States will be far too humiliating to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give a positive count for China in the long term by reducing the reciprocal dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions starting economic disruptions in one of the countries is actually far more dangerous than the spectators have realized before, ” said Abigail Grace, a research colleague focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a thoughtsmie.
Syria “ready” for returning refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeal for help to restore the country, which has been ravaged after more than seven years of war.
When he spoke at the United Nations National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are getting better.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress in combating terrorism,” he says.
The state continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now arranged for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their living.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, six million people still live in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that no conditional aid or aid would be accepted from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe guarantees Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA with an end result of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times after each other on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the Danish team captain Thomas Björn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was struggling during large parts of the tournament, hurt his tee-beats in the water at pair-3 16 holes, and had to see himself beaten by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all its rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten out 5 and 4 of the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup finale.
With eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind them, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most winning Europeans of the tournament through the times with 25.5 career points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful Thomas picked me out and believed in me.
I'm very, very happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said a emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the stick to his countryman John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.

U.S. team champion Jim Fury said after a disappointing performance for his troop, “I am proud of these men, they fought.
It was the moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw away.
The hat for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and I want to look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be your team captain.
You just have to take your hat off.
We were beaten."
