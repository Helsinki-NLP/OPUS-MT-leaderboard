Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently terrified by a proposal to change the name of the assembly member or AM (Member of the Welsh Parliament) to a member of the Walesian Parliament or MWP.
The reaction came because of plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Wales Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour said his group was worried about your "MWP rhymes on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, "twp" means stupid and "pwp" bait.
A member of the Plaid Party said that the group is not naked and has proposed options.
A Walesian Conservative member said that his group has an open mind when it comes to the rename, but added that MWP is not far from the word "snap".
In this context, the Walesian letter w has not been pronounced unlike the English Yorkshire dialect its pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, which now writes a legislative proposal to introduce the change of names, said: "The final decision on the name of members of the National Assembly will, of course, be up to the members themselves."
A Welsh official decision from 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposals that demonstrated great support for calling the Assembly the Walesian Parliament.
When it comes to the title of the National Assembly members, the delegation prefers the Walesian parliamentary member or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The National Assembly members seem to have made other suggestions, but the struggle to become alone has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work.
The legalisation of the reforms contains other changes to how the delegation should also function, including rules on discvaluation of members of the assembly and the design of a committee system.
The members of the Assembly will be able to vote on their names when discussing the bill.
Macedonians voice in people's voices about changing their country name
The electors shall vote on Sunday if they are to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was determined to solve a conflict that has occurred for decades with the neighbouring Greece, whose province is Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbouring country represents a demand for the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia’s requests for membership to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president Gerge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of names, said he's going to ignore the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are stalling while the churches of Harlem, New York, are struggling
"The old ones I've been talking to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
"Today there is none of the parts."
He said he understands why the bars go away.
"People socialize in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Bars are no longer in the neighborhood that people visit normally."
When it comes to the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later they are back where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by cooperative apartments filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic locations in the neighborhood.
“For most people who buy share apartments in these buildings are white,” he said, “and this is the day when all churches are closed, because it is unlikely that these people who move into the units will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white socks before Harlem became a black city - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black socket who had preached nearby moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock hired by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also hired the boikot of the stores in 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem where the owners were against joining or promotioning blacks.
The building suffered great injuries in a fire in 1939, but when his pastor Johnson’s followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new clock game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor in St. Martin, was proud and called the watch play "the watches of the poor."
The expert who played the bell game in July called it "One cultural treasure" and "One historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also commented that it was the first watch game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play on the larger watch game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin didn't find a replacement for it.
What has happened in St. Martin in the past few months has become a complex story about architects and construction workers, some of them added by the leaders of the laity in the church, and other of the Episcopal Bispedam.
The Sacristia, who leads the socket and consists of the leaders of the leagues, wrote to the Bispedam in July with concerns that the Bispedam “will ask the sacristia to pay,” although the sacristia was not involved in the bispedam’s addition of architects and building workers.
Some of the members of the socket have complained of the lack of openness from the bispedia.
13-year-old harm of shark under the humbling dive in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for hops in California on the opening day of the hummar season.
Attacked her just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with veins for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the gut shouting for help.
Hammel said that at first he thought only the guten was excited about having a hummare caught, before he realized that the guten cried out, “Something bit me!
Some bit me."
"Healed his collar bone was torn off," said Hammel that he observed when he reached the gut.
"I cried that everyone should get out of the water, 'There is a shark in the water!'
Guten was picked up by the air ambulance and taken to Rady hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's not sure what kind of shark it was like undoing the guten.
Bathkeeper Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the gut had serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities shut down access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
But not when Sainsbury's bets on beauty product
The British Butigda Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenham's beauty product and offer large magazine services in the store.
As part of an investment in Britain's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continue to grow while fashion and interiors are going down, Sainsbury's will test out their beauty product in 11 shops next year, and several shops if it gets a success.
The investment in beauty product comes in a time where the shelves that were dressed were filled with TVs, microwaves and interior now are empty.
Sainbury's said they'd double the number of beauty products to 3,000 products and offer trademarks Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They're supposed to give L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand, just like in the Boots stores.
The store should also relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and make most of the vegan products, which should attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume negotiator Fragrance Shop will test the parfyman floors in two of the Sainsbury shops. The first open in Croydon, London, last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online action and a switch against buying small amounts of food every day from local small shops, means that large shops need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, manager of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like big magazines, while the shops are not trying to fight the low-cost stores Aldi and Lidl with multiple services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has joined the interior chain Argos in hundreds of shops and introduced several Habitat stores since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the food room and thus defended the purchase.
But not its previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's cooperation with Boots in the early 21st century, but this ended when the parties did not become unanimous about how to share the profits from the pharmacies in the shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy chain Celesio, who had 281 pharmacy and owned the pharmacy chain Lloyds, $125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still have a role to play and will offer an expanded luxury series of skin products, including the name La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: “We have changed how the beauty shelters will look and experience to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also appointed colleagues with special competences to offer beauty testes.
Our merchandise is designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and the practical positions mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of acting."
Peter Jones 'rasing' after Holly Willoghby retires from an agreement worth £11 million
The star from the TV program Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "surprising" after the TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an agreement with his lifestyle brand worth £11 million to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to promote their interior and belongings marked as Truly.
The couple have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark.
The host of the This Morning, 37, made newcomers known at Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the middle of the development of the new, their cooperation on a lifestyle brand to focus on his own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was “surprising” when the golden Holly confessed during a stressed meeting on Tuesday at Jones' headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - mean that she no longer has time to cooperate on interior and belonging to Truly.
Collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was assumed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make it known that she should not work with Truly, while Jones escaped Britain to calm down in one of her holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term plan for the future, and it would last for decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one thought his own eyes on Tuesday, Truly was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for room.”
Experts believe that this Morning host, one of the richest stars in Britain, can cost the company millions of dollars because of intense investment in product, from pillows to candles to clothing and interior, and can cause delays with launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly mark with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as President of the Board in March.
Para vacations together and Jones owned 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a branding ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin who hosts I'm A Celebrity's ITV program.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Tough talks "and then we fall in love"
He was joking about the criticism he was going to get from the media to make a comment some could experience as "upresident" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Sa Trump with his silly voice as a news reader.
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a big step towards the decommissioning of the nuclear programme in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear programme have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diploma from North Korea Ri Yong Ho said to the world leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a corresponding response from the United States near North Korea's early downheart.
Instead, he added, the United States continued with sanctions to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We are doing great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of human beings would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, help to release hostages and returning the remains to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach in relation to relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there,” Trump and pointing to the group standing before him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy islands and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organisations were told that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants had to flee, no one declared a state of national crisis needed for international emergency aid.
"Sorry, they have been very clear in many cases that they do not want international help, so it's a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Redd The Children set up a team to go to Palu, it is still not safe whether foreign passporters are allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman of the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that the authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to offer emergency aid.
Although Indonesia is often exposed to earthquakes, it is not particularly predetermined for natural forces.
In the Aceh area they have built refuge spaces for tsunami, but they are not normal in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunami in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the city of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving the infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and next year there's a choice again.
President Joko is also under pressure when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative truy.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea by scoreing in the 89th minute of Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's target while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before he kicked him up and towards the target.
Attempted to sail high above the criminal field and to the right upper corner of the target.
Finally, the ball falls over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the target.
"I just tried to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq are trying to get as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came and dropped the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball."
Chelsea rented 1-0 after the break after the score in the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the target, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before he spanned town near the midway and into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic took the ball fast on the middle track.

Parliamentary statue of Cromwell becomes the last victim of the history rewriting
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England as his puritanic followers did during the Civil War in the 1600s.
But the Cromwell Federation described Crick's proposal for the removal of the statue as nonsense and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell League, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be a goal.
The Ikonoclasm during the English Civil War was strictly ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public dimensions in the 19th century, and is part of the historic history of a figure many still thought it was worth celebrating."
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, viewed as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was, of course, against the monarchy.
Whether or not this representation is correct is still a discussion theme in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of it separated.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killer pigs attack and kill Chinese peasant
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a South West China market, according to local media reports.
The man, with his surname Yuan, was found dead, with cut arteries and covered with blood, near a pig binger on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines on a garden of May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the gate of one of the pigs was open.
He said in the bing there was a big male pig with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that one 250 kilograms of heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and broken,” said the cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking others, while the police gathered evidence of the move.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market manager.
Although rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, and gave her husband serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kilograms of heavy pig held a Walesian farmer prisoner between him and a tractor, until his wife frightened the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to the CBC News that pigs are not aggressive at all, but that the taste of blood can trim the animals.
"You want to play.
They like biting a little, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You only need to respect them enough," he said.
The rest of the hurricane Rosa brings rain to the southwest United States
As predicted in the weather forecast, the hurricane Rosa becomes weaker over the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Still, Rosa will carry the rain to North Mexico and South West America for the next few days.
Rosa had wind power up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 5:00 in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the Hurricane Center was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure on the Pacific is moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity north to the southwest United States.
Rosa will bring up to one inch of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest for the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous flaums and possible landfalls in the desert.
Tropical humidity will result in rain between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the South West America, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the South West America; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous flaums may arise because of spread terrain and tropical rain.
It is warned against tours in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can turn gaps into flammable rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of South California.
Total precipitation of more than one inch is possible, which can create small flaums and smooth roads.
This will be the first rain shower for the season of the region.
Spread tropical rain cities will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain rises late on Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic is getting colder, but tropical areas will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even in small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
A lot of central and eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees and upwards from southern parts of the large plains to parts of the northeast America.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high chances of over average temperatures in East America over the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's witness in the US Supreme Court and a woman who blamed him for sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political discussion about the matter continued, with interruptions in the usual TV programs of various broadcasters to reveal the latest news on Friday: a consensus reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the debts in the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she's 100% sure Kavanaugh touched her when he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, under a feeling diversion, that he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw it on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The Society reached this speech by finding the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not clear from other channels that displayed the depleted, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, there's a similar number of viewers looking at an American soccer final or Oscar.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, said Nielsen.
ABC was second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
People are still interested in the hearing ring.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, a moderate Republican, declared himself on Kavanaugh’s side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants shouted after him to a hearing ring with a judge committee on Friday.
He stood and looked in the ground for several minutes while the Protestants shouted at him at CNN live.
"I am standing right before you," said a woman.
Do you believe that he tells the truth to our land?
Some said to him, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office has spoken, and before he entered the elevator, he said he wanted more to say during the committee hearing.
The Broadcasting Offices showed the hearing on TV in which the Committee of Judgment was to vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full-sized Senate and further smoking.
But Flake said that he could only do it if the FBI investigated the claims against Kavanaugh during the next week, which the Democrats have also requested.
Flake was partly overthrewd after talking to his friend, the Democrat, and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
The flag of his decision turned out to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not voice for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened a FBI investigation on the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May blames critics for playing politics when it comes to Brexit
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, owes the critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with the future of Britain without regard to national interests, in an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to participate in the Conservative Party's Conference on 29 September 2018.
In addition to the interview with May on the front of Sunday Times, an interview is held with the former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, in which he attacks the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect each other's fees is 'whole absurd'.
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest the suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims shootinga
The police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University, was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned for deliberate murder, states the police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, follow a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After the interrogation with Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
The bond to Simpson was set at $3500,000, reports the local newspaper The Advocate.
The Coroner in East Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday that showed that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge police thank the Louisiana state police for their special forces, their state police crime lab, the Southern University police and local residents for helping them find Simpson.
The athletic Director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being “awakeful in the achievement of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meters tall basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scores 5.6 points with 2.6 relapses per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU Basket Coach Will Wade said the team was "distrustless" after Wayde was killed.
"This is something we're always afraid of," said Wade.
Vulcan spit out ashes over Mexico City
The popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Crisis Center asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity increased in the crater and the centre recorded 183 gas and osteoporosis emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumbles and quakes.
Social media pictures show thin layers of ash on cars in different neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since a strong earthquake of 7.1 accidental central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as Don Goyo and has been active since 1994.
Police collaborate with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the voice of self-establishment
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrators clashed with police forces, and thousands of other demonstrators protested against themselves one year after the vote on possible release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder coats that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Clash also broke out later on the day, and the police used batons to prevent escalation.
For hours, the separatists shouted, "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the Protestants against self-reliance cried, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for injuries after protests.
The voice is still printed in the region and many will still have one year after the October 1st, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most choosers voted for self-self, but there was also low selection among those against self-self and bocotta voices.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the voice and eloquent clashes occurred in the region.
Groups who were too selfish were sleeping in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration went by the stack anyway, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protests with his wife, said that he no longer has any hope of self-establishment in Catalonia.
“ Last year we experienced one of our best sights.
I saw my parents cry with joy to be able to voice for selfishness, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who are too independent of holding on to power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while waiting for the trial for their role in the organisation of the folkmotion and the subsequent self-declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who filmed the protests to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict was headed up by politicians on both sides.
"The voltage increases more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been part of the ongoing trial since last year, declared that he will make elections in the European Parliament next year.
“To be a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the suppression we have experienced from the Spanish state,” he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland, men arrested for crashing into houses on purpose.
Three men in 33, 34 and 39 years have been arrested after crashing into a house on purpose several times in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
The event occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the car damaged the entrance gate and the building itself.
An armbrow may have been used to shoot at the car.
Menga shots give Livingston 1-0-sayer over Rangers in Scottish football.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston Sikrar says
The excited Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard to experience his second say after 18 matches trained for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot turned out to make the difference while Gary Holt's side joined the Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no winners in the Scottish Premiership League this season, and will play against Hearts, as they're eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in a row, and Coach Holt has still not lost since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against the abstinence team.
Holt's team was supposed to have hired long before they scored, and created several problems for Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had little effort towards goals, which made Alan Lithgow have to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the target.
The home team was naked with letting Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the away team.
And that's how the deciding goal became in the score.
Rangers joined a frispark and Livingston created an open, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scoring from the middle of the criminal field.
Before that, Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the Home Defense was solid and the Liam Kelly keeper was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos force Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flipped far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Pasts were sent back and forth in the Livingston penalties field, while two punishments - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were waving away.
"Fenomenalt" from Livingston Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal fight and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastic and still impresses on the upward curve.
Their play style has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks for it goes to Holt for the way he's shocked the team since he became a trainer.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense and organized a military defense, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the battle.
On the contrary, Rangers were not motivated.
Even as good as they've been under Gerrard, they weren't good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and only cut the home half once, which should make Rangers realize that they don't make it anymore.
Erdogan may intervene in Cologne
The state leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29, in Berlin.
It's the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is hoped to repair the relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have been unanimous in terms of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque due to “safety causes”, but many of Erdogan’s supporters met up to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of the Kurdish — also met to condemn Erdogan’s politics and the German state’s decision to welcome him in the country.
The duelling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others, who view him as an autokrat.
Car accidents in Deptford, London: Bicycles died after car collision

The collision near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast London, at 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and ambulance personnel quickly arrived, but the man died on the move.
The collision just a few months after another biker died when the driver ran off in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from today's accident.
The London police reported that they are identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other drivers have been encouraged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison in England: Six guards injured in rebellion
Six prison guards have been injured in a rebellion in a high-security prison for men, says the prison office in England.
Ongoing disorder broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces are captured to calm down the revolt, which involves eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for wounds in the face.
One prison spokesman said: “Specially trained guards will calm down the ongoing revolt in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate election in our prisons, and we are aware that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to go to jail any more."
There are over 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in Britain.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated for damage after an inmate attacked.
And in October last year, special forces had to come to prison to calm down a serious revolt, where prisoners threw billiard balls on the guards.
Hurricane Rosa truar Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flaum (for drying area)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is just such a weather phenomenon that is on the way to Arizona early next week, in the rest of the hurricane Rosa moves southwest over the desert and creates fear of flaum.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings against flaum on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and South and East Nevada, South East California and Utah, including towns Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give rain already late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service twitra that only 'ti tropical cyclines have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometres within the Arizona limit.’
The last models from the National Hurricane Center report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can count between two and five inches in other areas of the southwestern desert, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated totals up to ten inches [10 cm].
For areas outside the flow risk, the rain from Rosa may be a blessing in dry areas.
Although flaum is a serious concern, this rain is likely to benefit areas in the South West America that are exposed to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, there is extreme drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest drying category, reports weather.com.
First, hurricane Rosa will move across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, with wind of over 135 kilometers an hour, Rosa is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 miles per hour.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific and therefore calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm force, Monday afternoon or evening.
It will count a lot in parts of Mexico, which may increase the risk of flaum.
'Count between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, with the potential for up to 25 centimeters,' reported weather.com.
Rosa will move north along Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will move on up through Arizona and into south-utah Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger of Rosa or the remnant of this is a lot of rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the American southwestern desert,” said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life - threatening flaums in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton, England, four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and one 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, England.

Trump wins Kavanaugh "did" under how "slem and angry" the Democrats were against him
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and unrelenting tactics of the Democrats,” said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered under the "slem and angry" democrats through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, and refused emotionally for the debt of Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked her sexually decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony to her debtors in the earrings.
On Saturday, the president said that the "American people saw how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
“A vote to Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most skillful lawyers of our time, a lawyer with error-free public service,” he said to a number of trailers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans in the middle elections in the United States.
"Five weeks to one of the most important options in our lives.
I don't ask, but I really ask," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are seeking to “resist and block. ”
The first important vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to happen last Friday, said a Republican representative to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of killed increases
At least 384 people are killed, many taken by huge waves on the coasts, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to participate in a festival on the beach of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters tall, hit the beach at sunset, and took many people while destroying everything they came over.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the warning of the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who didn’t leave immediately and were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the crisis relief agency in Indonesia GDPB, in Jakarta.
“As if the tsunami was not enough in itself, he took cars, tree tribes, houses; he hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, and added that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed into trees to avoid the tsunami and survived in this way.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photo from the air published by the crisis agency shows many broken buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershake continues to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes could be marked around the area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s Institute for Technology Testing (BPPT) stated that the energy of the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy of the nuclear bomb over Hiroshima during the second world war.
The city's geography, which is at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the agency.
Nugroho injured the damage as “wide” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found during the remnants of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and the size of destructions may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication has been cut," said Nugroho.
"More than 30,000 people live there," said the Red Cross, and added that their volunteers and volunteers are on their way to their perimeters.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," said the Red Crush.
The Crisis Agency was criterioned on Saturday not to inform you that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that waves came within the time being announced.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building calling desperately to people down the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast and brings buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video at first.
The trembling and tsunami caused a breakdown and cut the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate emergency aid.
The military has started the process of sending in cargo planes with emergency help from Jakarta and other cities, reporting authorities, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city’s airports were reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
It was planned for President Joko Widodo to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
They added to the World Vision from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, and have set up tents in the backyard to their office. On the way to the city, they passed the total-destructed area, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
While the emergency aid organizations begin the work to help those who suffered the tsunami, some complain that foreign emergency workers with crisis management expertise have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organisations and their associates cannot start their work until Indonesia has declared the area a national crisis zone.
This has not happened yet.
“There is a crisis at province level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the state says "OK, this is a national crisis," we can open for international emergency help, but they haven't updated their status yet."
It is evening left in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, and friends and families of those who are still missing still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday, a little gut was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had a doctor prisoner next to her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglids from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
One man named Monday said that some of the prisoners in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my emotional burden to carry," he said.
Gendon told me that he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the paraglides from Palu, who had participated in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only one grey hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think this means the messages didn't appear," he said.
Thieves steal $26.750 from Newport, Levee, United States minibank
On Friday, thieves stole $26.750 from a worker at Brink's company in which he was filling up a minibank in Newport, Leveee, the United States, following a press release from Newport police.
The worker had just emptied a minibank in the entertaining area and was about to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy stated in the press release.
While the worker was busy, "a man jumped up behind the worker" and stole a bag of money to deliver.
Witnesses observed several suspects as they escaped from the scene, according to the press release, but the police could not determine the number of persons involved in the robbery.
If someone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper renames Ye
Rapperen Kanye West is re-named to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: "The creation previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was going to appear on Saturday Night Live, where he's expected to drop his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the show after she canceled for "sensitive causes," said the programkeeper.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think the word ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’ said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the Big Boy radio host.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye--to reflect the good we do, the bad thing we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are.”
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, which has previously worked with West, has also changed the type of the name with and without a hyphen and upper case.
The future president of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians.
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians, and the country will soon mark the 50-year memory of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to suppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-oriented student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly support to students and opening more free universities.
He has said that job solvency and lack of access to education have led youths to join criminal gangs.
USA should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China works more actively with artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in research on the subject, says the investor and the user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government spoke of artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A doubling of the budget for research on artificial intelligence would be a good start, because all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” said Lee.
A double in funding can double the chances for the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” this month through the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest ranked player of the game Othello, and later he worked as leader in Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognized former technology competitions organized by the U.S. State, such as “Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge” and asked the time for the next competition, so that he could be involved and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get State support, said Lee.
"It's not China who takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have rented excellent students from college to work with artificial intelligence in the last few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen research in artificial intelligence.
“I thought that doctoral students before artificial intelligence should receive automatic maintenance permissions,” he said.
The Government of China published its plan for the artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
China’s National Association for Science finances students at academic institutions, not unlike the American National Science Association and other state organizations’ way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a common center for artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from the industry and the Academy, and the White House declared the formation of a committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (known intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research in artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked with the bills on national security and artificial intelligence in several months.
Macedonians are voiced in referendums about changing their country name
The Macedonian people voiced on Sunday in a referendum if they should change their names to the Republic of North Macedonia to solve a ten-year-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the northern neighbouring country represents a requirement for their territory, and has used veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of names can undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the people of Macedonia.
President Görge Ivanov has said that he should not voice in the referendum, and a Bocott has sowed doubts about how far the referendum will reach the at least 50 percent of the population she needs to be valid.
The question at the public redress office is: ‘Are you for NATO and EU membership and unity in the agreement with Greece?’
Supporters for the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the change of names is worthy of membership of the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independently after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I am here today to voice for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding according to the law, a sufficient number of MEPs have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decision.
In order to change the name, Parliament needs two thirds to be terminated.
The state electoral committee reported that nothing unprecedented had happened before 3:00.
Only 16 percent had voiced, contrary to 34 percent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
"I voice for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumika in Macedonia in order to change their name and open to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a bocott of public redundancies in front of Parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country,” said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have worthy.
If they don't want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that membership of NATO will draw investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent employment.
“I think the majority will vote for the change, because 80 percent of our citizens will be members of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voice.
He said that a 'yes' result can be interpreted as a 'verification of the future of ours'.
An opinion measurement by Macedonia’s Institute for Political Research on Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum — which is below the required number.
Another meaning measurement of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of the choosers planned to voice on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said that 70 percent would say yes.
In order to close the folk voice, at least 50% of the voice must be voiced, plus one voice.
If the referendum is not successful, it may harm the policy of the left-oriented government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero navigates through the Brighton Defence and Scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling vraka Brighton defense that led to 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday in the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculous, scoring for 65 minutes.
The Argentinian tip accepted a pass on the middle track at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran past three Brighton defense players and reached open track.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before he jumped past several others on the edge of the Brighton penal field.
He got past a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English tip used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, which used the right foot to hit Brighton Keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot right into the right end of the target.
"Aguero still wrestled with his feet," said City Coach Pep Guardiola to reporters.
"We talked about he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scorned when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave the sky blue the first advantage in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep in the Brighton Territory.
He kicked the ball in a beautiful way along the left end of the path to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball while hiring Sterling towards the target.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into the target just before he scrambled out of the path.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoilers against Rockies in American baseball.
With Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was little reason to force a new start.
Scherzer is highly competitive and hopes to take "mounden" on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to "playoff" for Rockies, which leads with one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won at least 5-2 against the Nationals Friday night, but look forward to locking up the first division title.
"Even if we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team that most likely plays at the highest level this year.
Who does not want to play with such a relationship?"
It's still unsure who's going to start at Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer may have to "pitche".
Scherzer, which will start for 34th time, throws a 'bullpen session' on Thursday and should 'pitche' normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 Strikeouts in 220 2/3 'inputs' this season.
Trump collects Western Virginia choosers
The president was obscurely referring to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the middle elections in the United States.
"Everything we have done so far is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important options in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't set up, but I'm running everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this horrible, horrible Democrat group, you can see that it is happening right now.
And they're obsessed that they're going to take back the power, you see how awful they are, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they're going over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “refuse and block.”
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "singling and mean and disgusting and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who made his audience bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Was it you that leaked documents?
Eh, eh, what?
No, no, I'm expecting -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant to those who say what they mean.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voiced to incite me, it was not surprising.
I'm the last in a series of Labour-MPs who have been told that I'm not welcome - just to tell you what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested against antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized for being unanimous with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically was unanimous with former leaders.
In the call for the meeting at Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it said “we want meeting to be inclusive and productive.”
In my last eight years as the Labour MP, the Friday meeting has been just like that.
Sadly today's meeting was not like that, and the promise of "sniller" policy is long forgotten, if it was at all followed.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that each opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, when colleagues I used to be politically united with sudden expectations that I would change my mind and be unanimous in matters I would never agree on - whether it was about national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak public, it doesn't matter what I say, I always get mouths on social media and people want me to go off while they criticize center policy and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get sex discrimination and racist harassment every day and who are still professionals and do not leave.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period is how normalized it has become to harass politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should be more tolerant.
In reality, we are no longer a tolerant game that has something for everyone. For each distrust proposal and for each change in the party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I've received a lot of advice from people who have said I need to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will like me better.
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still in school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was about to collapse, so I wanted to have better public services for those who need the most -- whether it was a municipal adviser or Minister of State.
I've never hidden my political opinions, even in the previous choices.
No one in Nottingham East may have doubted what I stand for and which of the actual leaders I do not share.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country runs against a Brexit that will harm private, local and public services, I don't understand why people care to waste energy in questioning my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But actually, it's not the only message I've directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to the elections, whether they're Labour choosers or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no one can make me go off or change my policy and prevent me from igniting you in the way I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top of Scottish rugby
Two late 'tries' may change the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr would be able to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
They are now at the top of the palace as the only invincible layer of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave their home team and their coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be naked.
"We've been tested in the last few games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be naked," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr bets praise, they were better than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a 'try' in 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a 'conversion' as put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland Captain Rory Hughes of Warriors let Melrose gather, and Jason Baggot took a 'unconverted try'.
Climo was punished just before the break, scoring, and converted a solo try to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which was converted by Baggot, reduced the slinging rate by five points.
A long break occurred when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and put on the stretcher, and from the reboot fauk Ayr forward through atry from Stafford McDowall, as Climo 'converted'.
The working Captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got a yellow card, and again Melrose tried an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball from the criminal setup, MacPherson scored a "try".
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent "flanker" Gregor Henry away from his home team's fifth "try".
The star from the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant business
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the next nineth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will not comment, but a source from the newspaper Scottish Sun has suggested that Kiernan would be involved in the "good restaurant business" of Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia hopes that the court will open the waterway to the Pacific
Seals patrol marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flag with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from Titicaca Lake to Amazonaselva are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and the duty to return to it."
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline of the country losing to Chile, in a bloody conflict of resources in the 1800s. They long to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades, while Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of custody.
“Bolivia has driven, calm in mind and is well-being, and, of course, expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the judgment of the International Court, hoping that the Hague Court supports Bolivia’s claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - will give Bolivia an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia - who struggles to be elected again next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
“Now we will soon return to the Pacific,” he promised late in August.
But some analysts don't think the court will allow Bolivia to access the sea - and that little would have changed even if they got access.
The Netherlands-based UN Court has no power to transfer Chilen territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the Court comes only six months after the last negotiations indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In the last four years, far from saying Bolivia, they've done the opposite.
“The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
Morales, with his passionate rhetoric, has killed what was to by Chile's goodwill, meinte Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the situation after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is his representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an exceptional opportunity to open new relations with Chile” and a chance to “set a line at 139 years of inequality and rather benefit both”, he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the fact that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime problem to win voices.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't dispose of nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation cannot be the first to defeat if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He encouraged the United States to follow up the promise they gave during the meeting in Singapore between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come in a time when the United States' Foreign Minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to re-start its locked nuclear diploma more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will be submissive if the United States continues with sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington refuses to agree to any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolisting first.
Both Kim and the American president, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many people are critical that Pyongyang is serious about the destruction and that the country is most likely to see its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo's planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headwear is the last fashion on the way to a shopping street near you.
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you don't need to search anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special head coverings in their SS19 collection. The main plaque surprised the audience during the fashion week in Paris.
Mostly impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a magnificent, beige Valentino-hat with a feather-like, at a breeze that covered its models' heads.
There is also another overdimensional belonging to the fashion show, including a jewelry sausage, a wizard hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collapsing with bizarre masks just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were sewn together and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations looks like your equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like one melted ice cream in a cookie.
If you like this tremendously dramatic fashion, you can only glean.
Fashion experts find that the huge hats come for the hall in a shopping street near you.
The overdimensionated hats come right after 'La Bomba', the straw hat with the 60-centimetre wide brake seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the most impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk - a straw beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that wore it.
The beach bag, with the colour of burned orange and freezes the top with a white leather handle, was the most impressive part of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collision during the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the fashion stores next summer - the designer has made such an impressive impression that I doubt it is possible to ignore the demand for overdimensionated belongings."
John Edward: Global Citizens Need Language Knowledge
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at high academic level, and this continued in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only reinforced by individual and common success in sport, art, music and other social activities.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Self-Schools (SCIS), are working on providing the best services to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for advanced and higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made pensum, we see that modern languages are popular philosophy in the schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that languages are located at the top of the liga tables with the highest scores for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took absent language received A.
The data, collected from the SCIS 74 members, show that 72 percent of the students received A in mandarin, while 72 percent of the Germans, 69 percent of French takers, and 63 percent of Spanish takers also received A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland support apostate language as vital properties, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages such as elections are considered equivalent to STEM-faga (Science, Technology, Engineering Students and Mathematics) in the tuition to independent schools and other places.
An investigation carried out by the British Selection for Adding and Properties in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers struck to fill settings due to lack of language skills among the applicants.
Therefore, language in the school is increasingly important to prepare youth for work.
With more jobs for language experts, these properties are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what kind of career a youth is, if he has learned a second language, he has the right advantage in the future with such a feature.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any other language than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language that was spoken by a two-six percent, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Knowing more languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to the language in which they teach.
Many schools focus on the classic modern languages, while others teach languages classified as important in Britain when we look forward to 2020, such as mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a variety of languages to choose between in independent schools and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scotish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the properties they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied that in this global business-oriented environment languages are vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called "International Communication Properties".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice and thus offer many and high skills for Scotland’s young people.
Il faut the bee le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of independent schools.
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waitetida will soon be over to fans who are happy to see LeBron James debuting at the basketball team Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-song game on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long to play it hasn't been set yet.
“It will be more than one minute and less than 49,” announced Walton on Laker’s official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweet that James is most likely to play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked for his plans for Lakers' schedule for the preseason.
"I don't need a pre-set game at this stage of my career to get me ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned stop the coming week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote waiting to choose to fill the Max Court's vacant position, Trump aims to build up support for future mid-term elections because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voting is to be given in November.
What time is Trump supposed to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably record this week's hearings of Max Court-nomined Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about the claims of sexual abuse, with a expected confirmatory voice from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this cave of collections is to help the Republicans meet the November elections and get some moment (drive).
Thus, President Trump's campaign says that these five collections next week are directed against “informing volunteers and adherents that the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and Representant House” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season,” says a spokesman for the Trump campaign that refused to be informed to Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the meeting for the evening can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and withdraw coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate Candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is demanded in the opinion measurements.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a lift in the meaning measurements,” said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows benevolence for fighting to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday foursomes of the afternoon could only be like this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of moments is a completely invented sports attack, but one that players really believe in, and never more than in competitions like this.
So where would they say the moment is now?
'They had a six-point hire, and now there are four, so we take it as a small moment, I guess,' said Jordan Spiel when he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points leading with twelve more in games.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to encourage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and rents for examples.
The guttural screams of the celebration got higher as his round continued, quenched an important pill to make match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His pillow that won the matches of 15, was met with a similar scream, the type that tells you that he thinks the American team is not out of this.
"You've just had to dig deeply and worry about your own fight," said Spieh.
There are already all these players left.
18 holes to create an emblem.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible history of Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but cute couples are four from four and can't do anything wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only couple that shouldn't shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also checked bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a course of 18 holes) on Friday morning.
The race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, asserts that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European say when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
I prefer both at the same time on different holes.
Talk about European honor is even too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was the couple of Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, the rough Spanish and the Swede into a hole they never came near to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four balls and foursome are so fascinating to see close hold because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lead in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the same match to the fight that someone, especially the Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 rent in the Ryder Cup Final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the last day of Ryder Cup after coming out from the four-balls of Saturday and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari rented the charge with two wins over a fighting Tiger Woods to make his fight so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European page ordered to keep the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a mistended American page tomorrow fourballs, and took the 3-1 series.
The U.S. had more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they couldn't collect the undercut.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12 single games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie who wins four points in a row while he and Molinari, called Molliwood, after a spectacular weekend, are only the second couple who won four points from their opening in four matches in the Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they made such a great look to beat a deputy Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more demanded 5 and 4.
Woods, who struck through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe didn't get everything they wanted on a nice, blown day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American reference with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 say over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the open.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a layer come back from a four-point base and entered single, although as a owner, Fury's page needs to draw only to keep the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, it seems that a Sunday counterattack will be outside them.
North Korea says it won't be possible to rust one-sided without trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that if penalties continue to continue, the distrust of the United States will grow and that the country would by no means give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Government General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important measures” to improve the situation in the last year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promises not to spread nuclear and nuclear technology.
"We still don't get anything similar back from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we unilaterally disarmament ourselves first.”
While Ri, a known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington’s opposition to a ‘phase’ approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid to take progressive steps, his remarks proved significant by not rejecting one-sided nuclear destruction, as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Ri referred to a common subscription written by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for "destruction of nuclear power on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean war from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted conversations to facilitate difficult international sanctions in North Korea.
“The United States insists on the first reduction of nuclear power” and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose by force, and even opposes the declaration of peace,” Ri said.
"The fact that penalties can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is, when the sanctions continue, our distrust will only grow."
Don't mention the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. president highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister weighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, for the last five months and added: "If the party to this encouragement for the destruction of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the destruction of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the General Assembly of the F.N. that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the American mainland, after the evil president Trump called Kim a rocketman for suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to 'total destroy' North Korea, a lot of praise for Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea deviates its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timeframe for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the actions that have been done.
However, the U.S. State Secretary, Mike Pompeo, told the F.N.'s Security Council on Thursday: “The action to the Security Council must still be maintained vigorously and without failing until we receive the complete, final, verified settlement of the nuclear weapons.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to strangle the means for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the F.N. General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't work well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemns him to make " gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile and also a nuclear complex if the United States made “the corresponding measures”.
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent actions" he sought were security guarantees such as Trump promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking the course to get enough sleep.
A new course at Harvard University has this year contributed to all the students getting more sleep in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture of studying in caffeine all night, meaning that you use caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
An academic found that students at top university often were careless when it comes to the most basic - how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his battles in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the influence of sleep shortages on learning.
“A girl came up to me at the end and said, ‘Why am I told this now, at an adult age?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, roll out for the first time this year, the students explain what is important to how good sleep helps academic and athletic performance, and improve their general prosperity.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the head of the University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students had severely less sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is affected by sleep shortages, and how important evening routines are.
In another section, participants are told how long - term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, add Prof. Czeisler.
Stoltheis culture over the day still exists, he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep shortages are a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, even avoiding getting up in weight, because sleep shortages put the brain in a starvation mode and make them constantly solt.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after being a student with him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eye and inspired him to press to get a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and for when to wake up, and being aware of the harmful effects of blue light coming from electronic monitors and LED lights, which can completely convert the internal clock, resulting in problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets bring Gerrard's men down
Rangers had a new defeat on the distant path when Dolly Menga's article sent Steven Gerrard's uncovered page to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking for the first winner on the distance since 4-1-triumph on St Johnstone in February, but the team for Gary Holt just causes Gerrard's second defeat on 18 battles as leader, and gave eight points, one round under Ladbrokes leader of the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga hit to seven minutes before half-time, and a Ranger setup with missing inspiration never seemed to be to be equal.
While Rangers now fell to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and lies only behind Hibernian on the target difference.
And there may be additional problems in stock for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head, after an object apparently was discarded from the distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the layer that swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, walked with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot last week, and he would have been excited about the way his charity dress took the choking roof on his opponents on every shift.
Rangers might have the ball most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first article sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle-level player failed in his giant chance.
A long frispark from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the retreat.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than trust in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morello’s knowing that he was going to have a 20 - foot [20 m] penalties when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Steven Thomson is judging to wave away the desire to the Colombian.
Rangers only succeeded in two shots on target in the first half, but the former Ibrox Target Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's heads and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules, no one can deny it because of the shoot.
Once again, Rangers fail to handle a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson's ball, who stayed cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted as if he switched Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange caused an immediate impact when the wing player made a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rased forward to block.
But Livingstone continues to overliste the guest team to play exactly what they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett launching long shots.
Holt's team could have increased his hire at the end, but McGregor was very pleased to stop Jacobs from doing it until Lithgrow left a long story from the cornermark.
The reserve to Ranger, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim for punishment when he supported Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
General: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE READ ... the day when the one who was to become physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually resulted in the device known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific barbell ever since then, the Geiger counter also became a barbell in pop culture, as in the 1950 Bells of Coronado movie, with the apparently unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man, "What in the world is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you set these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms resulting from the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans, "Oh, yes, now bubble it."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that prays his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ red cells.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see red cells and kill them.
Vaccines learn the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of the treatment
This method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancers and then reinjection.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced the disappearance of ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can see a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinitiate the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 “driven the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and learning how they target cancer cells has worked when treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West begins a Pro-Tump diatribe, wearing a MAGA hat, after he's been visiting the TV show Saturday Night Live.
That didn't work well.
Kanye West was outpipeed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a marvellous performance where he commended his president Donald Trump, and said he wanted to set up for elections in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great-caps, he gave the Democrats a tire and repeated his support to Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a number together with Comrade Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Stars made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's witness in the Senate's Legal Committee on the debts of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the recordings to West's Tirade were uploaded to social media by Comrade Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to ridicule West with the article.
The West also complained to the audience that he had the hard backstage because of his headwear.
"They bullied me behind the scene.
They said, don't go out there with that hat.
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a drowned place," he said, according to Washington Examinor.
West continues: "Would you like to see the drowned space?" says he wanted to "put on the superman caps, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
His comments resulted in at least two outrops from the audience, and SNL cast members seem embarrassingly affected, reported Variety, with a person who told the publication: “The whole studio was deadly. ”
West was brought in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her former boyfriend, Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a presentation of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who twittra: “To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU UP TO THE POWER. ”
But talkshow hostess Karen Hunter twittra that West “maybe simply was just who he is and it’s absolutely amazing. ”
'But I didn't choose to pay anyone (by buying his music or dressing or supporting his 'Art') that I think embraces and spies out ideology that is harmful to my society.

The game of Thrones Star Kit Harington goes out against poisonous masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wing role as Jon Snow in HBO's eloquent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actress, 31, has gone out against the macho hero's stereotype, saying that such roles on screen often lead young boys to feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks something has gone wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of poisonous masculinity in the #MeToo Age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-player Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "may strong" to address the problem.
"Personally, I'm excited that something's gone wrong with the masculinity." he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very human characters.
He continues, 'What is congenital and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, what makes young people feel that they must be this special side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
'Cause it's obvious that something's gone wrong for young men.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not do the Game of Thrones predecessor or follow-up when the series ends in summer, and says he is “finished with battlefields and horses”.
From November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is history of a movie producer and his brother, who is a robber.

HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are the frame in the country, claiming health.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the amount of people who received HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health personnel at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, from year to year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 10,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ individuals is claimed to be widespread flora.
Because of the conservative values in the country, students have figured that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will finally marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add lacquer information from GOP Senator, it explodes in dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday claims that one member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican American senators on the Wikipedia pages to the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were pedaled by Extrem Right Survey and Websites.
"Lies, lies, and more disrespectful lies," said Waters in a novel on Twitter.
The published information included information addresses and phone numbers for the Americans Sens, Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of a Senate panel on the charges of sexual abuse against High Court elections of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the articles was linked to the Waters office and published information to a member of the Waters staff, reported Hill.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," continues Waters.
“One of my associates - who have received their identity, personal information and security compromised as a result of these unrealistic and false claims - was by no means responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded allegation is a false and an absolute lie."
The statements to Water were quickly criticized online, including from former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she has no temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone gets blamed for something they didn't do, they shouldn't be mad.
They mustn't be tough.
They must not question the motive of the debtor.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer proved to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Kavanaugh, who were blamed by critics for being apparent for anger during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to take over Water's place in the middle of the elections, also expressed his tanks on Twitter.
"Big if it's true," twittra he.
In its statement, Waters said that her office had announced “the right governments and the legally enforced units of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continues, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions for each and one of my associates."
Johnny English is going back - spying on weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit remarkabilitys in all new films with a British angle, and the work of this resuscitation of Johnny England's action comedy spoof-franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and which was resuscitated in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the self-ironical satire that deals with how openbert we are become the new exportability in the country?
In any case, the big ugly, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber duck has for the second time renewed his permission to fuck things -- his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad composer for cinema in non-English languages.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who despite his bizarre desire to spread a little glamour has received a little bit of Clouseau, a dash by Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a simple tune to the Fire Cars, the theme of the Olympic Opening Ceremony in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two fine moments in this last J.E.
I love Johnny English who approached a helicopter while he was wearing an armor suit from the Middle Ages while the rotor leaves hit his helmet.
The gifts of atkinson to physical comedy are on the screen, but the humor feels quite weak and strangely overempty, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself now safely offer the comedy as an ingredient.
The humour feels like he's directed against children instead of adults, and to me, Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replicaous nonsense in the person in Bean.
The permanent current presidency now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super-secret web network of spys, which reveals the identity of all the agents of the United Kingdom in this area, to the dismay of the agent at work - a unfortunately little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and war-hered figure, which already has a complete breakdown of political unopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is not much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that when each active spy has been blamed, she must collect someone retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works learning at a somewhat elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons about how to work undercover: a couple of nice jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type Academy for spying.
English is being sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reproduced with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving to a submarine job, an overenthusiastic role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things terrible crazy in Her Majesty's Secret Services is back to the full meeting with Olga Kurylenco's beautiful five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister fell dangerously under the charismatic technology of the billionaire's enchantment, which claims that he can solve Britain's data problems: the creepy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin to travel their journeys by pediatric game: disguised as waiters, put them guys on a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle on board Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when trying to use a Virtual Reality headset to make themselves known with the inner house of Volta.
I'm sure everyone stopped has been pulled out to the last sequence, but as sweet and undisciplined as it is, there's quite a lot of child TV everywhere.
Pretty moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't stop thinking, Can't the British movie industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to draw up a plan for the English to work for a four-day week, but to be paid for five days
The Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party now considers a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the report, managers will forward savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
Then the addition could enjoy a three-day weekend, but still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would 'fit' with the economic agenda of the party and plans to increase benefits for workers.
The change in a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be advertised before the end of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day week of work is a desire that fits in the approach of the party to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as to the party's industrial strategy.'
The Worker Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, when the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its campaign in 2017.
The ambition is currently not approved by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesman from the Labour Party said, 'A four-day work week is not party policy and it is not assessed by the party.'
Collar John McDonnell used last week's work conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "profitors" in rich companies.
The shader's plans also mean that the current shareholders in water companies can't get back all their wagers, as a government could make a deduction because of misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to place employees in company managers and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership fund) to give 10 percent of the ownership capital in private sector operations to be added, which would receive annual dividends of up to £500, about $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the TV program "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigating Kavanaugh could get them to change their thoughts
The FBI investigation on complaints against Brett Kavanaugh's judgment has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of to what extent the findings of the agency could affect some Republican senators to draw their support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in 60 Minutes asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on the way into the earring, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
Graham’s voice was still seen in stone.
"I've made up my point about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," said Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all of it's names couldn't verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new change."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York hosts Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an enormous impressive array of stars acting and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park's big plenary, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mende perform, but also to increase awareness of the true goal of the event of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, started in 2012, is an extension of Global Poverty Project, an international support group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary work; send e-mail to a world leader, call a phone call, or other meaningful ways to contribute to increasing awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand an action call, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded from its support players and participated in and pressed on a number of goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to the fact that world leaders can announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group of 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their operations showed at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that so far the security funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important obligations are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs who are obliged to ‘help children to reach their full potential’; promises to give Rwanda $35 million to contribute to the end of malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” told the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to require Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional treatment.
In answer to one of the usual questions on their website, they ask 'What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?'
Global Citizen replied, "It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the big bourgeois and anti-apartheid pipes lead us, we'll be happier because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is among some of the actors who are performing this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - inside secretary
Washington may ‘if necessary’ use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's engagement in Syria - especially where they operate on the invitation of the legitimate government - is an asset to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to disseminate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has this educator, with our Navy, to make sure the sea roads are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that their energy is not going on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event arranged by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group presenting itself as "the vote to the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to handling Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
“The economic solution in Iran and Russia is more or less to utilize and replace fuel,” he said, while referring to Russia as a ‘one-trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been on mission to increase the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this context, officials of the Trump Administration, including the United States President Donald Trump, try to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipe project, which, following Trump, made Berlin the “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the Nord Stream 2 pipe Lead, which is set to double the existing pipe management capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
Kreml claims that Washington's eager opposition to the project is only driven for economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the position that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said the Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. holding has refrained from Germany, which has confirmed its obligation to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has encouraged the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country disrupts our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Empress Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to set up as presidential candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said that she would take a 'fair look' to post the presidential candidate after the mid-term election.
At a Council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirms that she would consider making a candidate.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our poor government, and it includes a woman at the top,” said she follow The Hill.
'After 6 November, I would like to consider carefully making a presidential candidate.'
Warren joined President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said that he “is taking this country in the wrong direction. ”
"I'm deeply worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been in trouble with his criticism of Trump and his High Court election Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need a FBI investigation before the vote."
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's own choosers do not think it should be a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said that the Senator shouldn't be candidate, following Suffolk University Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe investigation.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he wanted to decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump Collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested and charged with a elected event in the home on Monday night.
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, so I can relate to others familiar with PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at a collection for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "you come back a little change, they come back here, they come back here and they wonder if respect for what they and fellow soldiers and pilots and all other military have done for the country exist."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was blamed for physical authority in the world against a woman, for having disturbed a report on authority in the world and the preservation of a weapon while he was rushed, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts in Columbia support a legal challenge to a new American policy that refuses asylum to victims who flee from re-elected or elected in the world.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts submitted a friend-of-law short Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions suits the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberty Union) archived in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and the chosen members of the gang-sons" abused her, but American officials refused her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for American asylum, which nations face invasive problems with gangs and elected in the world.
The New American Asylum Policy reversed a 2014 decision from the Immigration Act, which allowed illegal immigrants who were escaped from power in the world to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a novel Friday that the new policy “is ignoring many decades of governmental, federal and international law.”
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum matters be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such an obstacle contradicts this principle," said friend-of-law briefly.
Advocate Generals further argued in the summary that the policy that refuses immigrant access damages the US economy, and says it is more likely that they become contractors and “supposes necessary work”.
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration courts to no longer give asylum to victims of volatile abuse and re-election in June.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion”, said the Sessions in June 11 in its announcement of policy.
Asyl was never meant to alleviate any problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperated rescue work in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race for survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It feels very excited," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who thrust her feverish baby son at a evacuation center in the devastated city, Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find."
Citizens have been observed on their way back to their broken worlds, searching through swashed property and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a strength of 7.5, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken their backs and shoulders, rested outside Palus's military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because of still strong post-quakes.
Tears filled his eye while he told me that he knew the powerful earthquake shaking the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think, “telling Haris to the Associated Press, and adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador blames China for "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper run a four-page advertising in an American newspaper and highlighted the mutual advantages of trade with the United States and China, the American ambassador against China Beijing owed it to use the American press to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid subsidies in the Des Moines registry - the state of Iowa's largest salsavis - after having blamed China for trying to interfere with the US Congress election on 6 November, a debting China refuses.
Trump's debt that Beijing tried to intervene in American elections, marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase of an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in rounds increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's return tariffs early in the trade war were designed to meet exporters in states that Iowa supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador of China and the former long governor of Iowa, an exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers, and farms.
"China," wrote Branstad in a part of the Sunday Des Moines registry, "doblar no bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by adding a paid ad to the Des Moines registry,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, by the newspapers down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited deviating voices and will not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on the problematic economic path of China, given that the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party “screamed him.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers distracted the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans depart female choosers for the middle semester with Kavanaugh Debacle, warning Analytics.
Since many top republicians are stand-by and defend High Court elections Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple charges of sexual abuse, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a relapse, especially from women, in the coming midway choices.
The senses around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have registered that they already wanted to proceed with a voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of State Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) the last moment's pressure for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang “November coming!” while demonstrating in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who run the court committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be outside the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-particular political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it's already been high, that's true.
But there can be higher, especially among female choosers in the suburbs and younger choosers, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which detailedly indicated the allegations of sexual abuse directed against the nomination of the Supreme Court, suggested analytics that a relapse could follow if the Republicans pressed forward with the confirmation.
“This has become a confusing root for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early in the previous week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the Committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it is also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that is involved in choosing Democrats, pointing to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a bit divided over who they should trust in the cool water of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more side tracks with the latter.
A new meaning measurement from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, and at least one other complainer, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford testifies to the judiciary committee of the Senate last week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the highest court-nomined showed her sex organs while participating in a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inventor to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a start that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project for technology legends, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to set where the data is stored and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is "world dominion".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data storage or POD.
It can contain contact lists, memories, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a web browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal web shop is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "Personal Authorisation through Data".
The idea of Inrupt, following the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some added developers with contract to work with the project, as well as a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about not making a complete change where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We do not ask their permissions."
In an article on media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute for Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been a voice with a great impact on the debate on online neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will become the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next epoch on the Internet," said Berners-Lee 10 l.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross Divine Celebration
The only English church deity that won a Victoria cross during the first world war as a giant has been celebrated in its hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Reverend Bernard won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Still, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memory stone was removed from his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “brilliant symbolic”, that the stone would be removed just 100 years after his grandfather’s prize winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Col Vann hired his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 “through a very thick shot and under heavy fire from field and machine guns. ”
He later jumped up to the front line, and with the "largest galanteri" led the line forward before he alone rushed forward with a field gun and knocked out three of the group.
Lieutenant Col Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "Something I know I could never live up to, but something I am delighted for."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very era of playing a role in the parade, and added that “the value of a real hero is displayed by the support given by many people.”
MMA fans were up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a package of Bellator 206men and you won't be able to see the main event.
The calculation from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was displayed live through the night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were prepared to meet each other, seeers in Britain were again numb when the covers changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were little impressed after keeping awake to early hours especially for the fight.
A tab on Twitter creatively switched to the children's comic book as "a kind of sick joke."
“It is public regulation that at 6 o'clock if the hole was not owned like that, they had to change to the program to the children,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked for the transfer.
‘The pepper pig, ‘yes.’
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they'd be working on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think of replay, I think we can figure it out," said Coker.
'But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and we won't find out until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it went over, there were many lyrics that went forward and back, and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't that; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We keep it to five matches instead of six -- which we usually do -- and we tried to pass to the fans, and we just went over.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘underprivileged’ because of sexuality
The Olympic stump Tom Daley says that in his upbringing, he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't understand until he went to the advanced school that "not everyone is like me."
When he was talking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about his homosexual rights to give others hope.
He also said to be a parent, so he doesn't care much more about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in the long-run show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off because of disease.
What could look like a lost in the Lavers' first program, Daly said that he felt "less than" everyone else who grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, the sense of feeling less than and appearing different is the real things that have given me the power and strength to prosper."
He wanted to prove that he was something, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-way bronze olympic medalist has become a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance on the Commonwealth Games of the year in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to live open without diversions and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that getting in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than he was last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he went to his first OL 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and downturns.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all about I have to win a gold medal," he said.
"Well, there are bigger things than Olympic Gold Medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at a age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his dad didn't accept his death and one of the last things he asked for was if they had tickets to London in 2012 - when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be in the front row," he said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and watered bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of an Olympic public, where there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song election - proud of Heather Small - who had vibrated with him in the construction of the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench of Ryder Cup Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for one record 12 times, was seen on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in front of Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working his game within reach of the hope of correcting what plagues him.
Never the most competent longitudinal codes. Not even at the top of their career, the 48-year-old is the best way to hit with the longitudinal code on the swinging, French main course, where balls hit outside if the golf player is not exactly the one with the hits.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Mickelson meets in the 9th fight Sunday, the exact British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all their four battles this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single fights, get to a warm start, Mickelson's fight can be quite decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a applause on my back and put his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” said Furyk.
He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He will be out there, just as everyone else will be."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fallo's record in most Ryder Cup games that will be played on Sunday.
This can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half, although Fury said that his proximity brought some intellectual property to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people, and he's a nice guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun having a time with him too, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just playing."
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big rent can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjørn, the European Captain, knows from experience that a significant lead on the way into the last days' singles of Ryder Cup can easily be converted into an unpleasant trip.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where one side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only crossed the finish line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a large lease in Valderrama; we had a large lease at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Bear, after seeing Class 2018 wins 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You'll be fully open tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things
This is not over until you have scored the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've always said, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's going on on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Happy about how his players have acted on a tough golf course, let Bear add: "I would never take the victory on the top.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances come forward, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you're being tested full of your capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to disseminate to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself as well."
Contrary to Bear, against the number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Fear yourself has been in both ends of the reverse operations in the great last days, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe left the "Miracle in Medinah".
“I think every fucking word of it,” he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players on the way into the last day.
“We have 12 important fights tomorrow, but you want to get started with the fast start that you saw on Brookline, as you saw on Medinah.
When the moment is allowed to go one way, a lot of pressure is placed on the middle matches.
We set up our line-up equivalent and set the guts up in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to hire the match and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the schemes.
"I walked with this group of boys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bearn about its choices by singles.
Germany’s new warships postponed once again
The latest fregate of the German Navy would have been ordered in 2014 to replace the oldest warships from the cold war time, but it will not be there until at least next year due to the wrong system and scrupulous costs, reported local media.
The launch of Rhineland-Pfalz, the leadership until they split the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregattes, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships the Navy ordered back in 2007, replacing the elderly Bremen class fregatts.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a series of anti-fly and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to place the latest fregattes for up to two years away from the ports at home.
Nevertheless, continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships, which seem to allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be outdated when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unhappy F125-fregate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to receive the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
It was not known about the causes of returning, but the German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship unusable if they were placed on a battle task.
Software errors were particularly important when ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on older Bremen freegates.
It also turned out that the ship is dramaticly overweight, which reduces performance and restricts the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7000 tons Rhineland-Pfalz is assumed to be twice as heavy as ships like that used by the Germans in other world wars.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including the training of the crew - becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached fainting €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from initial €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems associated with the latest fregattes, become particularly important in the light of the last warnings that Germany's fleet power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the fleet, in fact, “is almost out of distribution-competent ships”.
The officer said that the problem has been built on over time because old ships were deviated, but no replacement ship was delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to join the fleet.
National Trust is a thief on the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish hillland aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
It is hoped that findings will throw new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at National Trust for Scotland will follow the normal and soprano pipestrelles and also brown long ears and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS set and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and the types that do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS scientific adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat, natural worlds, which are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the purchase of meadows and how it is best to maintain the same forest areas for bats and other associated species.
Fladdermouse populations in Scotland and over Britain have decreased significantly during the last century.
They are thought of construction and development work that affects sleeping areas and loss of habitats/buyplaces.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks by pet cats.
Bat is not really blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching prey animals.
They use a sophisticated echo location technique to detect errors and obstacles in their aviation route.
The NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, sleepplace inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, the home of eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees, and all the good habitats.
But there's a lot of bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and in other property domains will help us understand more about what they need to enjoy."
He underlines the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within property domains, since it is possible that infinite destruction of a single living place can kill up to 400 female bats and young people, and perhaps destroy a whole local population.
The bat is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, plague, or disrupt their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and too many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects the debts of jurisdiction in which lawyers sue German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo has marked the claims against himself as "false news" and says that people "want to highlight themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are sued for the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forwarden have been blamed for choosing an American woman called Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He's claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo 33 says to its 142 million followers only hours after the debts, that the debts are "false news."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, five times the Goldball winner says into the camera.
"You want to market yourself using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be familiar with saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good, "Leave the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel on the allegations, which they have called "an unauthorized report on suspicions within the area of privacy", according to Reuters
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for “moral damage in a amount that depends on the severity of the breach of the rules, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years. ”
The alleged event is claimed to have been found in June 2009 on a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, claiming that he was supposed to have chosen her analt, follow documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo falls on his knees after the assumed event and told him he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed by "1 percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographed her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed on an equalisation because she felt "frightened by retaliation" and was worried about "become public audmyka".
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to change the dwelling as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the verge to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a € 100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'Would always undo' to lose car manufacturers
Britain “will undo it forever” if it lost its world-leading status before car production after Brexit, Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was 'if' that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of limit delays in case a non-contracted Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see the production stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fear of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what car manufacturers say are the risk of supply chains in case of a non-contract Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a just-in-time basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers for ordered cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the borders that the industry wins can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day of the inventory at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU was “net-top calibrated to avoid border controls”.
"We need an appointment. We want the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but to grasp this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's agenda.
“Proof not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not tell how long production was to stop, but in the longer term warning them that additional costs would reduce competition to the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the facility, said that his members are more concerned about: “After my experience, when these jobs go away, they will never come back.
One spokesperson to the government said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Vice-Chair Advocate Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the fight against High Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Council Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election mixing, interconnections between Trump assistants and Russia and potential obstacles to the justice of the President.
Corvidt Trump will resign the general to the Attorney General or not, and thus put Mueller's self-establishment in jeopardy, has nurtured Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lead to register conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refused the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to quit.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was deliberated to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission's hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the full vote from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There is no date set. It may be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be delayed another week because of everything else that happens in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters may say they're unanimous: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since September 10th.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientation was not due to a dissatisfaction with the TV reporter's game for the gallery, although she said, "I'm not unanimous about it."
She mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the pressure will increase.
“The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before,” she said - right enough without giving proof of the claim. “We have looked at the number.”
Sanders says that updates will still happen, but “if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it like this, and you've seen us do it often in the past few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when traveling from the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It's not normal for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, where he appeared to lead the reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Health secretary writes about Brexit fear to workers from the EU at NHS, Scotland
The health secretary has written to workers from the EU who work at NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a wish for them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though it is less than six months left before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to taking on the costs of applications that have the status of EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations have continued to be made between the United Kingdom and the EU, and it is approaching the expected conclusion in the autumn.
Still, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand this must be a hard time for all of you.
So I would like to repeat now how much I valued my contributions to all the added, regardless of their nationality.
Collegs from the EU, and outside, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve work in the health sector and are beneficial to patients and society.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
The linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency operation after he put a head damage on his head when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports the newspaper The Tennessean.
Main coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reported reporters that the damage happened just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way," Reed said.
Coachs and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a stretcher and brought him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesman from Tennessee State told WSMV that Abercrombie had finished surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There is no detail about the extent of the damage yet, Harris said, and added that Tennessee State is still trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes to the second year of college and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five charges before he was injured in Saturday's battle, and is now up to 18 in total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in Britain
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in Britain. The additional income should be used to help the homeless, follow the new plans of the conservative
Decided will neutralize Corbyn's success by attracting young choosers
The increase in document fees will be added to those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The state bank expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will today advertise that foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in Britain. The additional income should be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young choosers who serve much, with promise to offer reasonable dwellings.
The increase in the document fees will be added to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of circumstances.
The fee, which adds to the current document fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago on the second dwelling and rented dwellings, may be as much as three percent.
The government fund expects the decision to be paid up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 percent of London’s newcomers are purchased by residents outside the United Kingdom, which increases prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the dwelling market.
Many prosperous areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become "spiritous villages" because of the large number of foreign buyers that most of the time stayed in other countries.
This new policy only comes weeks after Boris Johnson wanted to cut the document fee to help several young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms to keep up the prices by obtaining property, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas of reasonable dwellings to fix Britain's "bostadshome".
Corbyn has announced a series of striking suggestions for residential reforms, including controlled lease and the conclusion of unfounded views.
He will and will advise more power to build new dwellings.
May said: "I said last year that I wanted to dedicate my position to bring back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
That means fixing the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it may not be right for individuals who do not live in Britain, or for foreign companies, to buy dwellings as it is for hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of their own dwelling has ended too far away, and the audmything of being circus is real.
Jack Ross, 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "solid ambition" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The shooter (42) forgets the challenge of resuscitating the club from the north-east. Currently, they're in the third place in the League One, just three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country playing.
I got a B country fight, and that's what Ross said to Scotlands BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland on Hamden joining my father, and there's always been something that has pulled me back.
The possibility can come only if I have success as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors like Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he hasn't been worried about coming after so many established names in such a big club since he has previously refused approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, success for me will be measured in if I can get this club back in the Premier League."
Based on the structure and facility of this club, there is no doubt that they belong to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only think of myself as successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the training equipment of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to recover from decreasing to third level and transformed St. Mirren, who was about to move down, to the championship series title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falk Church, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a divorce," he says about leading Alloa.
"I really thought being a manager would fit me much better than being a player.
That sounds weird, 'cause I did good, I lit good and I liked it pretty well.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you have to get through every week.
I still mark it when it comes to stress and pressure with the job, but it feels right to be manager.
I always want to be a manager, and now I am. That's the most comfortable thing I've felt in my own body throughout my grown life."
Sunday, September 30, you can hear the entire interview at Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
Investigation indicates that the perfect time for a litre is 17.30 p.m. on a Saturday
Summer’s hot wave has led to an increase in the intuition of strenuous pubs in Britain, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, the salon increased by 2.7 percent in child nutrition - but for the restaurant industry it went down by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
“ Continuing the sun and the fact that England was in the World World Cup longer than planned, ” said Peter Martin, who was responsible for the statistics, “that July followed the pattern for June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, just that restaurants became even harder.
The decline of 1,8 percent in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubes and bars that sell drinks made it much better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs like selling food, gained and noticed the sun’s decline, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People may only want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had decreased by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, analytic of RSM travel and leisure, said: “These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of an enormous social or sports event, will still be the main factors when it comes to the room in the outdoor industry.
It is not surprising that the restaurant industry will still wear; a decrease of 4.8 percent annually will be hard to get at the top of a running cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for food operators. The time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can give a long-term breathing space."
The total salsaukation across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the downtrapping of brand products.

One of five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents
One of five children - some young as 11 - has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, shows an investigation.
Examination of 20,000 students in progress reveals an increase in fake Insta profiles
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a head profile showing their parents
One out of five children - some young as 11 - making profiles on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A study among 20,000 students in advanced school revealed a strong increase in fake Insta profiles - a reference to the Instagram image sharing platform.
News has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile head profile they refer to parents, while they have private profiles.
A mother who snubbed over the secret page to a 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to "choose me."
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) at different schools found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create sites on the Internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes ‘the voice of the athletes’ of the Scottish sporting board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Sports Board as a non-administrative director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated sportsman in Scotland, and director Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those in charge of sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level during the last decade.
“Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, Britain, and the world’s athletic communities, and we are sure that the sport in Scotland can benefit from getting her into the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for trainers, and I hope I can contribute and help the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among its total four OL gold and now is a regular guest at BBC, was unable to go for a drop.
On Twitter he wrote: "Today it's a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said there was only time to tell me if I was going to be okay or to what extent.
It has been exhausting work, but I've gotten completely good, learned to go again, and today I'm doing flexibility exercises!
"Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Split on the Internet on breast pump advertising that compares mothers with milk cervix
A breast pump company has divided opinions on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows.
In order to mark what is described as ‘the world’s first silent, seated breast pump’, the technology company Elvie dropped a small freckle advertising inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump gives mothers who extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes text such as "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tails" and "If you didn't mark it, this is not tension, it's my tits."
The reflection continues: "Push it out, pump it out, I feed these children, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
On the other hand, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has created controversies on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it highlights the "fright" in the meieri industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and feed to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from them only days after birth, ” writes one.
Elvie breast pump is discrete in a breast-feeding BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Absolutely traumatic enough for both mother and children
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their kids?"
Another added: "For an actual removal of advertising."
Others defended the advertising, and a lady admitted that she thinks the song is "party."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd have one if I'd still be my grandmother.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
This advertising is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product, wrote one.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad directed against mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that boasts or judges the meieri industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they've all danced with the discreet pump packed into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely quiet, has no hires or pipes, and is discreetly inside a breast-bH, which gives women freedom to move, keep their kids, and even walk out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it fortifies a waveful and provocative launch.
By pulling a parallel between mothers who extract milk and dairy cows, we wish to put search lights on breast pumping and challenges associated with this, and at the same time demonstrate the incredibly freeness learning the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During Moteuka in London, a mother to two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved quietly to camp at the Texas border
The number of imprisoned immigrant children has topped themselves even though monthly crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict policy of Trump administration has made it more difficult to place the children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and receiving a child can threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of this increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members are forced to send fingerprints, and that these data will be shared by the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement testified to Congress and said that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of individual minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had nothing on their record already.
"Near 80 percent of sponsors or sponsor family members are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to keep persecuting these people," Albence said.
According to the entrants in the camp, new rules have now been introduced to manage the children. The rules require some of them to go to court within one month, against the previous 60 days.
Many will participate via video calls and not at personal meeting, in order to have their case tried to conduct an immigration sentence.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely it is that they develop anxiety or depression, which may lead to elaborate outbreaks or escape frequencies, say the ones added to the camp. Reports that have appeared in the last few months say the same.
Speakers say these concerns are greater by large installations such as Tornillo. Because of the size of the plant, it is more likely that you ignore signs that children work hard.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or say hate to veins, can enhance trauma that many already have to endure.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, although the country is now in war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who and serves as Vice Prime Minister, said that prominent forces remain illegal in Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and “will be treated from it.”
"They have to retire immediately and without predecessors," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to “fight a holy battle until all Syrian territories have been cleaned” for both terrorist groups and “in illegal presence of prosecutors”.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advice of both Kurdish forces and Syrian arabars against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
When talking about the refugee problems, Moualem said that it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed 'some western countries' for having 'spread irrational fear' about the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organisations to make up for the return," he said.
"They're making politics out of something that should be a pure humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
The UN diplomats say that a recently established agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel fortress, has created a possibility to continue pushing forward with political conversations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a major attack from the Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
Moualem nevertheless underlined that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Nusrafront, which are linked to Al-Qaeda, as "will be wiped out."
The United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to gather the first meeting soon in a new committee of government and opposition members to draw up a postwar law for Syria, and pave the way to the elections.
Moualem lays down conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the Committee and says that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against disturbances.
Why Trump will win another semester
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals probably hope, the presidentship will have an early end because of scandals and national law.
It would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic ending of a presidentship ever!”
In writing there are no characters that the viewers have gone tired.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in best broadcast time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has almost tripled its to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has doctors at the top of the cable ring with as much as 3.5 million viewers in evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to because there is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designed Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, an old writer and writer of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, ” has another theory.
She's thinking of a cab in Boston before the choice in 2016.

Why? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied Scovell.

Of course, unlike everything else on TV, history coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can rejoin and greet the global economy.

Money from the outside streams into the closest middle fight
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a transformation of the districts of Congress that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The newly surrounded suburban district in Pittsburg is a Democratic representative of Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election last spring.
Lamb is fighting another seated member, the Republican Keith Rothfus, today a representative of the former 12th Pennsylvania district, who largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was rewrought after the University of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
Competition on the 17th District has launched a arms draw on the financing of the campaigns, between the large parties their monetary arsenal, the Democratic Congress Selection and the Republican Congress Selection.
Lamb was a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congress district.
The seat had belonged to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with over 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a scarce advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support for China, but retired
Diplomas note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already known Beijing without any negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama for partners to throw out the Trump organization's leader group.
The State Secretarys decided to bring back the U.S. Heads of Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the Ministry's spokeswoman, in an appointment early this month.
However, punishment was only considered against El Salvador, an estimated $ 140 million in American aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The probable penalties, which contained cuts to financial support and targeted restrictions on visa, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
Since internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar collection last year that was considered a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue and put an end to the assessment of El Salvador’s penalties.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been scheduled in the middle of October, as a signal of the relevance of the administration, said the diplomats.
And the three American messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who were alone in discussing the internal considerations of anonymity.
The description of them was confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the administration and also spoke while maintaining anonymity.
Study History
Waiting for special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, which now have significant evidence in the public protocols.
In the following reports, Mueller has turned the focus of the investigation against whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia ideira attacks on our elections.
If the Congress were to change the leaders, Trump would have to stand in this body, preparing to interpret the voters and possibly a jury of his equals.
That's a lot of 'what', and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable -- rather for his counterpart in Europe.
There is a choice to take for all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the fight can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, only the West had stood against him and helped the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed a chance to avoid the years of bloodbath.
The course of history turns around such turning points, and democracy is accelerated or postponed.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What would we do if Trump fired Deputy Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's destiny?
Rosenstein has been on deep water since this newspaper revealed that last year he suggested listening to the president in hiding and wondering if he's unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
“How would we respond if the recent FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or he is accepted by the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we in the middle election vote for a congress that keeps Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're failing because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to light the Sabbath lights on the table asking the Swastician.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimized for the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that say over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee damage prevented middle-level player Graham Dorrans from performing his first performance this season before the 2-2 result against Vilarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the fight with the thought that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could do it at the end, but everything is a draw probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we got out in the second half, and it was better done.
On Thursday there will still be a big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough fight. They got a good result in their previous fight, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can go on and get a positive result.
Last year's definitely been tough, with everything that's happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now feels good.
The stable is good and gutane thrives; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run now, put the previous season behind us, and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement saving
Despite the fact that participants in an investigation had clear ideas about how they would be preserved, few talked to family members about it.
Approximately half of those who took part in an investigation from the Nationwide insurance company said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to keep that conversation," says Vice President of the Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to care for yourself if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Collaborate with an advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options may be a major part of setting costs.
Get a financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you to find out how to pay for these expenses.
The funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with cash value to help pay the expenses, or that you secure yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal matches before they start.
Get a medical authority in place so that you select a person you trust to supervise your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
You can also assess a warrant for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your calculations are paid if you do not have the option.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on its way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Write down all these details in a font plan, so you're ready.
"It's not just the finances it is about, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
“What kind of medicine is that?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people are killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, says public officials. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
Without the possibility of communicating, helpers have not received any information from Donggala, a region north of Palu nearer the epicenter of the quake that had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. An estimated population in 2017 was 379 800.
The city celebrates its 40th anniversary when the tremor and tsunami hit.
Donggala is an area that stretches over 300 km with the coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than one province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and gardening are the beacon of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is and important in the province, but is mostly concentrated on Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, followed by the Indonesia Disaster Reduction Office.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses were destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Seismic Firering in the Pacific, and it is a mellitus of earthquakes.
Here are some of the big tremors and tsunamis in the last few years:
2004: A great quake on the west coast of the Aceh province in the northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of great quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A quake of strength 6.8 hit south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that crashed into the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A quake with strength 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the Province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: A strong tremor 7.5 hit one of Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A small tremor hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused the destruction and panic when people were reminded of the tremor and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 people lost their lives underground buildings that rasted.
2018: Big trembling hits the tourist island Lombok and kills more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists on the temporary beach.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested and prosecuted for power in the world
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and Vice President Candidat Sarah Palin, has been arrested, targeted for assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Police, Palin (29) was arrested after suspicion of power in the world, intervening in the reporting of power in the world and opposing arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a woman acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin's going to be jail in the Mat-Su prison, and being held against bail $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared in court Saturday and declared himself "no guilt" when he was asked, abandoned the network.
Palin faces three class A mistreatments, which means he can be imprisoned for up to one year and get $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a class B mistreatment, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
My mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in the veteran court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with attacks in the world, intervening in a report of power in the world and holding a weapon while he was drunk in the context of the event.
His boyfriend had claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after having tied his son's chosen behavior to PTSD, from when he served in Iraq.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds lost their lives
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The trembling, with strength of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of worlds.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit just outside the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment of dazzling hits flourish on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the width.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for suspects in New York terror.
Federal Attorneys in New York will have a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal offence in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) is reported to have used a Home Depot rental car to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway on the bottom Manhattan in October, where he drove down footwalks and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “willfully” and that he “willly” caused serious physical damage, following a note archived in the Southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be due to a possible death penalty, says the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury delivered a list of 22 points of charge, including eight charges for murder targeted for blackmail, usually used by federal prosecutors in connection with organised crime, and a charge for power and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded 'significant planning and deliberation', said the prosecutors and creepy the way Saipov carried out the attack as ‘disgusting, cruel and corrupt’.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov causes damage and loss for familiar and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the note states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the last time the Southern District of New York has sentenced the death penalty in a case.
The aim, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for killing two drug suppliers, but finally was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York City in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy to commit spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of anger in the days and months followed, in the following legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done most well, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching videos from the ISIS on the phone, says the charge.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He hasn't declared himself guilty at all accused points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "definitively disappointed" with decided to the Prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to go after death penalty, rather than accepting a claim for lifetime in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong trauma from the event for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after death penalty.
Member of the House of Tory thinks that Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army" today, during a protest at the Tory country meeting.
The former leader of the British Dependence Party said that politicians had to “feel pressure” from the Eurosceptics – suggesting that one of Theresa May’s members hire negotiations with the EU.
The conservative, mean Member Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "had been out" no, if Farage was the Brexit Minister.
With the challenge May faces to settle her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who wants to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggled to keep the Chequers compromise on the right track after attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allied insists that she will press to make an agreement with Brussels, despite the retreat – and force the Eurosceptics and the Worker Party to choose between its package and ‘caos’.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihole that he wanted to “dismiss Chequers”
He suggested that Farage should be decently ranked and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had ruled, we would be out now," he said.
The Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I want to fight for Brexit, but we have to reject Chequers."
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own promises in our own country."
Bone rejects the claim that the meaning of the people has changed since the election in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to become, is completely false."
Brexits from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march, and she told the reporters: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
“Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequencies the streets and get us chosen initially.
Please drop the Chequers and listen.
In a message directed against May, she adds, "Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians must know the warmth if they are to betray the decisions taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"You're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we're not gonna let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make the political class, which is on the verge of betrayal of Brexit, feel the warmth.
“We mobilise the army of this country that gave us the say in Brexit and should not sleep until we have become an independent, self-controlled, proud Britain.
At the same time, Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting in the center.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give say over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team orders from Mercedes would have a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start in the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself in defending his position the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and let Hamilton enter the back of the traffic, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ported in front after a little action side-by-side which made the Ferrari driver against would have to leave the inside free in danger of not being able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21th anniversary, in the back row and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.

The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein on a constituency Saturday because she insisted that she didn't leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she accused the High Court-nomined Brett Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
In a speech at a Western Virginia election meeting, the president did not mention the Ford testimony directly to the Senate Commission, but rather commented that what goes into the Senate showed that people were “bad and horrible and speak falsely.”
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and unpleasant and speak falsely," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you think?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lay it?
Do you think of her answer... did you sheet the document - ' oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't sheet it."
Wait a minute.
Let's... no, we didn't lay it, he added, while he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of charge against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it became a game earlier in September - but Feinstein refused to leak from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't lay her story," said Feinstein to the Committee, following The Hill.
"Ho asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her refusal does not fall in good soil with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I say you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While he continues to defend the High Court Nomination, who has been accused of poor sexual behavior by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
“You are determined to take back power in every way they consider necessary.
You see the badness, the badness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over for power and control," said the president in the following Mediaite.

Giants got a two-stop lead due to attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie remedyed before Dwyer once again sent Giants to the lease.
Francois Bouchard countered Dundee before two cases by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sikraen.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the guts of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.

Airlines lose their lives to ensure that hundreds of airplanes escape earthquakes
An Indonesian flight leader is honoured as one of the heroes after he lost his life as he continues to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers got safely into the air.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami Friday.
Strong aftersquakes continue to disturb the area, and many are trapped in wreckbacks in the city of Palu.
But despite his coworkers ’ flight for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even if it swept wildly.
He stayed to make sure that the plane on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought it collapsed.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decisions may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan, California, to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Sadly he walked away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country's crisis relief agency says that access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we can't reach," said the office spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass excavation on Sunday.
Emergency aid comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance comes with several bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
The small shops have been robbed."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and told the military in the country: “I ask you all to work 24 hours a day to do everything you can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?' reported CNN.
Indian earthquakes in Lombok occurred earlier this year, and 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports missing a man from the lagune plane.
The airline that operated a plane crashing in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, reports that one man is missing, after having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that from Saturday afternoon they do not know where the human passenger is.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline didn't give any more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the authorities stated that seven people have been sent to hospitals.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in a stable state.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened to her.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to wade through the water, which reached their way to life, to the emergency exits of the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew had panic and screaming, and he attracted a head injury that wasn't serious.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors in the vicinity, who worked to repair a dock, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to land before the plane sank at about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in the run by PNG registered airlines in the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analytics make timeline over the night when woman was burned alive
The prosecutors presented all evidence of Saturday under the due charge for a man charged to burn a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett testifies for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he put together recordings from mobile phones to find out what happened the night when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett told him that he used localization data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers' night she died, in contrast to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone while he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
Then told Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their mobile phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers died, they deleted Telli's messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from his cell phone.
"He removed it from his life," said Hale.
Defense will end the case on Sunday.
The judge said he's expecting the trial to go to the jury later on the same day.

Another black person?!
New York Children's Passenger sues couples for kicking after racist text message
A babysitter in New York sues a couple to fire her based on discrimination after having received an incorrect text message from her mother who complained that she was "one black person only."
The couple have refused for racistness and compared the case to extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the babysitter she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, ENNY SVART PERSON,” wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending a message to her husband, he sent it to Maurice, the babysitter, twice.
After experiencing her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman babysitter Maurice fired, and said that the previous babysitter, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before sending her home in an Uber.
She wants $350 a day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was without a contract, where she would live with her family.
"I want to show them that it's not okay to do that," she said to The New York Post on Friday, and added, "I know there's discrimination."
The couple have refused to be racists, and they said that giving Maurice the fire was the only thing they could do after insulting her, because they were afraid that she would take vengeance.
"My wife had sent something to her that she shouldn't say.
It is not a racist.
We are not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you let someone you have insulted take care of your children, even if you weren't supposed to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think of it."
Plasco compared the prosecution to extortion, and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you really attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a good thing to do," said the investor Plasco.
As the case goes on, publicity has been quick to judge the couple on social media and criticize them for their conduct and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid people wouldn't like a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
The daughter of the author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: “It is hard to imagine how it was to read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know now how successful Paddington was."
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed emotions during her book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
When it comes to Paddington, as she described as “a very important member of the family,” she added that her father was proud of the interior of how much success he did.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he never laughed," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children that achieved something: you will be proud of them even though it is not really you.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was gonna die and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughters were taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice in a hurry, where doctors work in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she would make it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"So Nad called to say that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I'll come soon to be with you.
I'll be there soon.
The medication doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping was slowly on the way out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to shut down.
I just sat there, knowing this happened.
I couldn't shout or scream because I was in a room surrounded by familiar and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, had to walk on the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she had just been through.
"None knew anything," she said.
"I sat with my head bowed while the tears fell."
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women hanging notes on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who took suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached notes to a bridge in Wales that will inspire people who are thinking of taking suicide to change their minds and call the numbers on their notes.
Davis his son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to struggle with depression and killed himself when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day."
Davis, 45 years old living in Lydney, said that her son was a talented cook with a smile that was infected.
"All knew him because of his smile.
They said that his smile brightened up all the rooms."
But before he died, he quit his job because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still worried that the little brother might have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "for people to know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if there is a friend.
Don't sit there alone - you need to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has been friend of Davis for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was sad or depressed or anything," she said.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed that he started acting differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on the first Christmas day, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't even look at them."
She told me that his death was very traumatic to the children, and they continued to work through the trauma: “There is a large space in our family right now.
We're completely broken.
But we all have to fight to live."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation.
"I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he asks – a limited investigation – we might be able to achieve a little loneliness," said Flake on Saturday, and added that he is afraid the Committee "Fall" in the middle of a partysanar backlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The United States Interims are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans do not do well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the United States Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then has been the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents their report?
They're going to voice in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh can gather at least 50 voices in the Senate, and with 50 voices, Mike Pense, the Vice President of the United States, can give him the last voice and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of skippers in North Korea "Slows" under Kim
The number of North Korean jumpers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean lawmaker
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Department of Unit, and said that there were 1127 jumpers last year — compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reason why the number has fallen.
Pyongyang has not declared himself public.
Most jumpers from North Korea get South Korean nationality.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flights via China, which have the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views jumpers as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back with force.
The relationships between North and South Korea – which are technically still in war – have improved in the last few months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to negotiate the destruction of nuclear weapons.
These conversations come after the historic meeting in June between the American president Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they became unanimous in working for an atomic Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, the United States, owed us nothing since then.
“Without being able to trust the United States, we cannot trust our country to be safe, and in such a situation we cannot put our weapons down first,” said Ri in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and says he can't serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said that he has too much temperament to light up in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh hysterical in an interview during Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
“I know that if a woman had acted that way, she would have been called ‘hysterical’, Pelosi said of the witness to Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and refused all charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh’s opening speech, he was very emotional and sometimes shouted with a lump in his throat as he told about his family and years of progress.
He criticized the Democrats of the Committee and called the charges against him "grotesque and a planned attack on his reputation", organized by liberal politicians who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that he can’t light in the Supreme Court because it shows that he is prejudiced against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi objected when asked whether she would try to get Kavanaugh to leave if he was elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats obtain the majority of the Representative House.
“I can say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he can’t serve in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he serves now,” added Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s federal appeal court.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat she is concerned about potential judgments from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known for being a conservative judge.
In the earrings to confirm Kavanaugh, he refrained from answering questions if he would turn certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great," Pelosi said.
And women have to swing the sword
It's a fair bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you think?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high business position, who said that her branch when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she branched, "You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears serve as a way to get the mind out, but many misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from an earlier job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I was in anger, and a woman who was older than me took my neck -- she was a cold leader that I had always been terrified of — and pulled me out at the time.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"You don't know you're mad.
They think you're sorry and they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman, a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was taken into being equipped on a boat called Monkey Business, and retired from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she might as well make elections as president himself.
"I hadn't really thought it through enough," she said to me while she laughed, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who made elections, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already been in progress for a while, it hadn't collected enough money, so she promised that she would only quiet if she could collect $2 millimetres.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her support players who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $2,50.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she was not going to make elections anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aim at the voices instead of the delegates, and anger against sexual discrimination, that she began to cry during her speech.
"You should have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said about how the press reacted when she branched.
"You should have thought that Kleenex was my head sponsor.
I think I was thinking, what will they write on my tombstone?
‘Ho branch’?’
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening salves of the trade war between the United States and China were earwaters, and while the battle continues, a division between the two countries can be a benefit for Beijing in the long term, say experts.
The American president Donald Trump shot the first shot this year to tax important Chinese export products, including solar cell panels, steel and aluminium.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken homes and set a tariff of between five and ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the United States for every shot they fire, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to end at first.
To get Washington to quit, China must do what the United States wants, but to bow to the United States is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the American pressure can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to go under is more dangerous than people have dare to admit before,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a thoughtsmie.
Syria 'clear' for the return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily and ask for help to rebuild the land that is destroyed after more than seven years in war.
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the situation in the country is making progress.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to regain normal areas.
All predecessors are now in place to allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country they had to travel from the ground of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond daily life and living.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5,5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the war began in 2011.
More than six million people in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the ruined country.
But he stressed that they will not accept assistance or help with terms from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe guarantees the say in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 when they beat the American team with an end score of 16.5 against 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown of that team to the Danish captain Thomas Bear, reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, cut most of the tournament, knocked the ball in the water from the tee at hole 16, pair 3, and gave it to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all its rounds and became one of four players who ever had 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the lowest ranking player on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the highest rank of the world, became 2 and 1 by English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who shares eight Ryder Cupar, became the most winning European with 25,5 points in career.
"Of course, I didn't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So thankful Thomas for electing me and believing in me.
I'm so, so glad to have the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said a emotional Garcia after the European Seer.
He sends the stick to the countryman John Ram, who beat the American golf-legenda Tiger Woods 2&1 in single games on Sunday.
“I know a huge pride in hitting Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him,” said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all his four fights in France, and now has a record of 13-21-3 I Ryder Cup up through the career.
A strange statistics from one of the world's best players, which has won 14 big titles and has only been disabled by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team stopped finding the fairway all weekends, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, made a disappointing statement from his team: “I am proud of these guts, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we made it warm for Europe.
Me fighting.
The hat for Thomas.
He is a lonely Captain
All his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with PGA in America and our committee for Ryder Cup and get on with us.
I love these 12 guts and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to take the hat off.
We were circulated."
Update of dinoflagellates: Concentration is reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota

Districts of dinoflagellates are around 16 km out of the Hillsborough coast, but compared to the previous week, there are fewer areas.
Dinoflagellates have and have been observed in Pasco.
There have been reports of moderate concentration in Pinellas the last week, low to high concentration along the coast of Hillsborough, low concentration in Manatee, high concentration along the coast of Sarasota, moderate concentration in Charlotte, high concentration in Lee and low concentration in Collier.
