Cried to the World
The market campaign looks like you Need Iceland seems to have started well, and crying and crying out in the natural world has started to pull people wide and wide around the world.
“Your own philosophy, I need Iceland, ” says one woman in the big world in commentary on the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another spectator claims to keep Iceland in his heart forever, and a young woman says that she must get to Iceland as soon as she can, if her fiancée lives there.
Fortunately, though, she is in the United States and assumes that she will have to wait for a few more months.
Another spectator asks if the route to Iceland is capable, for there are no planes.
It doesn't follow the story if he comes from another time zone.
Egill Thordson of the Peel advertising office, who came to make the advertisements along with the M&C Saatchi International Advertising Agency, says that the reception has been hoped again.
“ I found many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already in progress.
In the basics, it's about creating PR values, it's getting foreign media to deal with the campaign, and it's done amazingly well.
Over a relatively short period of time, we have received a discussion of some seven hundred worldwide media that covers over two billion people.
The value of this review is estimated to be $1.8 billion.
It's not awkward."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, even though the Americans are not going to the country in advance.
According to Egil, such a marketplace as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also been acquainted with, such as Russia, which is pleasantly surprised.
There was a reaction from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically proposed.
“ These advertisements have traveled farther than we expected, ” says Egill, but perhaps more than four million people have watched the YouTube material.
“We couldn’t have wished for a better start. ”
The photographer of the Morning newspaper, Årni Säberg, took pictures of the advertisements that carry the title “Let It Out ” in the middle of the last month.
They were taken wide and wide, as in the city of Reykjavik, in Reynisfjara, by Forest, at Sunshine, and in a cave by the Sheol.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki, the son of Peter, and Gunnar Paul, the son of Olaf, of Scott's production, and the taker of fear of the son of God.
The roles of the Icelandian Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary, were taken into account.
A number of Iceland’s advertisements were made, but at the same time as the recordings took place in the South, there was another group in the western and western countries.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, which is intended for a winter campaign with M&C Saatchi.
“ This is just the first phase of this work for the Iceland Lab, ” says Egill, adding that cooperation with M&C Saatchi has been very successful.
“ Working with them is great.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Explosive Spirit: Speak the position on the labour market, pension funds and much more
Axmunder Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, meets in Bombisand, starting at 10:00 on the Wave today.
He is also a Minister for Labour and discusses the position on the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other matters.
He also discusses landscapes and transfers to a land that has gone bad and has been controversial over the last few years and decades.
Robert Thor Ingolfsson, Chairman of the VR, will also participate in the programme, but he will discuss his criticism of investments in the pension funds and presents ideas that trade union movements and professionals will withdraw from the administrations of the funds to reduce the risk of interest-related events.
This will be discussed with Mr Ivar Ingimarsson, a traveller in Austria, and with Mr Johann's daughter, Director of the Nordic Marketing Agency, about the status of travel services in the countryside.

The show below can be listened, but it starts at 10:00.
That's what she looks like today 25 years later
The actress Elisha Donovan had a successful career in all kinds of teens.
However, she was world - famous for her play as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
Then she also played the Sabrina shows: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
She has been a little touched recently, but she was moved to look over the road and comment on Clueless in Australian television on the days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
“ I have to admit that I was mostly based on girls I met at school who were not good at me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after a night's stay.
Some fifty cases came to the police in the capital area today and reported in the police diary that things were different.
The day of the police station on District Street began by the police having to intervene with a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there because of drunk driving.
If the man had failed to leave after he was released, he would not obey the instructions of a police officer who told him to leave.
The man gained a continued stay at the police station because of his progress.
Then a man was arrested in the morning year suspected of a burglary in a company in Copavogi.
The police also had to intervene with two people in Breiholt because of reports of physical assault.
Then, too, a woman who sat at dinner at a shopping center in Copavogi could not pay for the bill after the meal was finished, so she was called to the police.
This morning, too, a car was stolen in the city center.
The white Renault car driver, for a while, searched for her, and she was taken freely.
The car hasn't been found yet.
The Curse of the Gleading Party - The horrible Destiny of the Globe Stars
The theory has reached a flight on the Internet for a curse over the series of the Glade League, but the actor Naya Rivera drowned in California during the days and thus became the third main player of the shows to put life ahead of age.
The themes of the Glee is a popular series of music, dance, and joy.
The programs dealt with the so - called joy band of youths in high school, their love, and fate.
Being in the joy band was not always taken out, but through singing and dancing, the characters appeared to overcome any situation in their lives.
But outside the scenes, there has been great disasters over the players and the staff of the programs, so much that the teachings about the curse of the shows have been raised.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez, a cheerleader who did not call all his grandmother.
After the series had run its course, Rivera took Ryan Dorsey, the actor, and he had his first and one child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and separated them.
Dorsey, however, refused to sue, and the domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, it was announced that Riveru was missing after her four - year - old son was found alone in a boat in Lake Piru, California.
The boy found himself sleeping in a rescue vest on the boat, and he could tell the police that he and his mother had swimped, and then Rivera would have brought him back into the boat but never returned there.
A massive search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the local police officer reported that we had assumed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially decreed.
It is believed that she had a heavy tide in the water and was renewed by her last demands to save her son.
The cause of death was reported to be drowned by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took the role of Finn Hudson in the shows, the American footballer with the voice of angels that played a key role in bringing the League of Glades to praise and respect.
Outside the shows, however, Moneith wrestled with personal devils.
Since 13 years of age, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his associates felt enough in the programs, intervened, and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and seemed to be looking at a better way.
Only two months after he finished treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after having gone out to have fun with friends.
Banamein was a fatal combination of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that there was a deliberate act.
Moneith had undergone treatment, and his tolerance for drug administration had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his associates, but under his opposing wife, Lea Michele, was determined to continue taking the shows and dedicated them to the whole part of Moneith’s memory and his character Finn’s.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah “Puck ” Puckerman in the shows, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Glade League, or until he got the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles suspected of child porn protection.
At his home, he found a huge amount of child porn, and the matter soon became public.
It was clear that Salling had gone.
He was then accused and convicted of his transgressions.
He had four to seven years in prison, as well as he would have to be on the record of sexual offenders and seek the treatment of childish love.
Before the judge had decided the punishment, Salling, then free from insurance, found himself dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors who fell from early age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
In 2013, only 41 years of age, he was immersed in sleep.
The program also worked for a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of Julia Roberts, who had no beauty in her sister’s story, but she accused Robert of great government and disrespect.
In 2014, Motes took his own life, who struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancée, where she asked her mother and sisters, among other things, to be responsible for what happened to her.
“ My mother and my so - called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that it was them that caused my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the shows.
She has recently been accused of mobbing her accomplices and mobbing at the scene and having a superb star.
Jesse Luken served as a guest in 2012.
He was arrested and charged for drunken driving in 2019, which was very scandalous.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the shows.
In 2010, unruly computer scumbags found her in naked pictures and published on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played the shows and had a relationship outside the shows.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used violence in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
When children are allowed to play with their parents in the garden to cultivate flowers and to watch them grow and prosper.
It is also infinitely possible to make with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having time with your children in the garden is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Buying a boat after tenth grade
“ I don’t think we’re many sailors working at the schools of the country, ” says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, who is fishing on the coast in summer but who is studying psychology at the University of Iceland during winter. ”
Seafood is a very comfortable summer work when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income, and I like to be able to drop the loans.
My income is also good in the winter," says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, a 25-year-old psychiatrist who hunts in the beach this summer, as in the last summer.
Axel was the newest to the dock at the Tabernacle Ceiling when a journalist reached him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“ The tith - grade water I took for boats less than 12 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after I graduated from high school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summer.
I bought the boat used by my friend, John’s son Hartman, and I gave his name to the boat.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being to the sea, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat, ” says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“ I made a deal with Hartmann about paying half, half a million, at the beginning of the summer, and half at the end of the summer when I had been hunting.
So at the end of my first summer, I had no debt to the boat."
How, though, could a boy have one and a half million dollars to pay out on a boat when he had just finished high school?
“ I had put up and collected money, I had been working with my father to sea when I was a boy, I was all summers hunting with him, and I got my share.
I also put my tuna money in my boat fund."
Axel was born in the father of Iceland, from where all his mothers are: but he has lived in Copavogi, since he was a boy.
“ I can hunt here in the west area because I have a legal home with my grandmother at Ishafer.
I learned in these areas west of the roots with my father.
I move between distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all the West.
Although I feel better in the west, I have also given around the Snow Falls and elsewhere.
I have also given southern, but it is a gray drop," says Axel, who always robs one early in the morning and says that he sometimes speaks to the moons and sings to the heavens, for hours alone in the ball sea.
“ The online connection on the sea is good, so I can call, listen to video shows, and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be alone.
Of course, I try to avoid getting in danger, but at times something has been in the weather, but never much danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never sea sick.
He says the length of the day depends on how the hunting takes place each time.
“ I’ll never be more than 14 hours on a hunt at a time, but I’ve also been hunting in other systems, such as in the rent quota, but I’ve been hunting for a year and a half a day at sea. ”
He says that the fishing arrangement allows him to hunt 770 pounds a day, which he finds hampering.
“ Other restrictions are that I must not hunt Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I may only hunt 12 days a month, these four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their days of hunting for the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is to calm people instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and being able to choose according to their heads.
So the perimeter could also go for me, and a sea space that is well located in the fishing areas should be enjoyed," says Axel, who draws mostly cod from salted seas on their coastal hunts, but also only fumes and exceptional other species rivers with.
Axel works during the winter course of college at Nupi theatre in Copavogi.
“ I don’t think we are many sailors who work at the schools of the country, ” says Axel proudly, adding that he was only planning to work temporarily at the theatre.
“ I got stuck there because I like this wonderful job.
I hope that my psychology study will benefit me in the future," says Axel, who is also advanced in business science.
Registration error prevented the home notification
An error in a registration paper that people fill out when they arrive in the country caused an individual living in this country to not be re-engaged in a sample.
If the person fills out the form in English, it is not required to enroll a identification number, as it is when it is done in Icelandic.
“ This will be reviewed during the week, ” says a medical expert in the field of health care.
Three infestations were detected at the Virologic Department of the District Hospital yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the entry into force of the so - called home infology rules.
Those living in Iceland will then be screened at the time of their arrival and again proclaimed in a specimen four to five days later.
On the other hand, in the noon news of RUV, the person had followed the old system.
The wire on the border was negative, and he was not called back in the screening for the virus.
Camilla Rut Sigfusdaughter, a specialist in the field of medical care, says in a discussion with a news office that this is due to a mistake in the electronic registration paper.
If you fill out the registration paper in English, you do not need to enter a identification number as in the Icelandic version.
Yet, it was primarily thought for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person has not been automatically invited to take a sample.
Kamilla, however, says that many have followed the rules on the return portal even though they have completed the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to send people back in a show after they arrived in the country.
“ This will be reviewed during the week how to make access to it easier to draw their attention to the process. ”
The man is in isolation, and six have been placed in custody.
They all go to samples, but two had started to show symptoms.
Infection is now undergoing the three viruses that were diagnosed yesterday, mostly due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, a serial analysis of Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there are variants of the coronary virus not previously found.
In the second instance, it has been pointed out that Israel, although known, had also traveled to other European countries.
Camilla says it should be tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation based on the COVID. ice.
135 are in suspicion.
Four out of five non-associated infections
Five infestations have been diagnosed in this country in recent days.
Of these, the four alphas are unconnected and are not to be detected the source of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports convention yesterday.
Infection is still in progress.
Originally, in the third tens of specially dismissed persons were reduced to sixteen.
Overall, 34 people suffer from these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of exposure to sports events and has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Johan K. Johannsson, Head of Public Defense Officer, says this slowly, as long as people follow standards and regulations.
“ We are constantly impressing on all those living here that it is necessary to maintain individual protection.
We also need to impress on those who are holding events that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
Then it is possible to keep an event," says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by exercising individual contraceptives.
In addition, rules and standards are subject to constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what the public defence department and the local medical office are constantly focusing on, is the attention of these individual contraceptives.
Both at home and at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents contamination from going on," says John.
“ We need to urge people to continue on the good road that we were on to sustain the results we have so far. ”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, and she urged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was due to sudden difficulty in breathing due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death certificate as the underlying problem, Brumfield, also diabetic, feared that the same would happen.
The Reuters reporter says Brumfield's fear is not unfounded.
The number of new research carried out by the U.S. authorities shows that nearly 40 percent of those who have died had diabetes 2 as their underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is considered, the ratio increases to half.
The CDC study included more than 10,000 people in 15 countries that died from the corona virus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in CDC’s infectious diseases, says that the results are striking, especially for diabetic patients 2 and their loved ones.
In the slow growth of Reuter, the responses from the 12 countries responding to comparable proportions were concealed.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet reported underlying diseases.
“ Symptoms were already pandemic in slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful age," has Reuters by Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes are more common among black and South American people, who have also worsened the corona virus.
One of the best precautions for diabetic patients is to keep the disease under control by exercise, healthy diet and healthcare professionals.
However, the coronary virus epidemic has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
In this case, high prices of insulin have forced some to continue to attend the work and thus risk being exposed to the virus.
Reuters notes that the United States authorities could have been aware of the dangers that diabetics 2 may be caused by the virus.
In 2003, over 20% of SARS coronary viruses were affected by the disease and in 2009, this group had a three-fold higher risk of hospitalisation.
When MERS responded so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were enrolled in intensive care had diabetes.
According to professor Charles S. Dela Cruz at Yale University, because of the influence of the COVID-19 virus, the epidemic could have taken away the cover of many previously unknown complications.
“ I fear that when this is done, we will see flooding problems, ” says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Association.
Physicians have warned that the corona virus epidemic could indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new studies suggest that the crown virus may lead to an increase in the incidence of diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the corona virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, the already weak organs in many diabetic patients.
In this case, a high percentage of glucose and lipids in the diabetic patients can induce a true “cell signal storm, ” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged intestinal cells can also lead to inflammation which can again cause fatal blood clots.
“ This is all one big puzzle, ” says Dela Cruz.
"This is related to all the interdependence."
The news has been corrected.
"We were invited champagne, then they left the room."
Asrún Magnus ’ daughter and Atli Bollason received the unusual request from the artist Robert Gargamel son to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was putting up in Paris.
“ We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated. ”
So atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother, Asruna, for the first time.
“ I was very impressed by her.
It was naturally just the radiation, but then I thought she was quite incredibly cute.
And still feels," he says.
Asrún also remembers this end, the husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
“ I'm always hearing this story.
At the end of the weekend, she says, who also attracted to the husband at first meeting.
“ I felt and feel so excited around Atla that I like.
There's a lot going on and much going on, and I was fascinated by it."
Atli says that her husband and wife have emphasized their own ways in their relationship.
“ We do not tie our backs the same knots as travelers.
We avoid routines that we analyze around us."
There may be a reason why they took the matter from Ragnari, the son of Gargamel, just a joyful artist, even though that would be less than unusual.
“ Our fellow friend Christine Anna contacts us and asks if we can come to eat desert with him, Ragga and Ingi save Ragnar’s wife, at Snaps. ”
They accepted the offer, met the trieych at Snaps, and had desert wine and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for a art show that he thought he would set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris, in the fall.
“ He had a multi - channel video work called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Asrún says that he described the work as a banal and decadent late from the daily life of Western people.
“ He had sketches of all the stages he was going to shoot, and last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating. ”
The Senan that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show young middle - class couples love in minimal rooms.
“ These are intercourses with the beginning and the end, ” says Atli.
Even though they knew about him and him, the couple “but they knew us and felt fit for this.
They heard that they did not want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they would not get the right people, but people who would get sexual masturbation from performing for others."
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“ When we got out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Are we not just ready to do this? ’
It was just like that.
I trust a Ragnar as an artist and all his team," says Asruna and Atli.
"This is about love and the nearness"
The Senan was taken up in a fine apartment on the street.
There was a very few teams of films; a cameraman, Ragnar, and a soundman, and the couple.
After the tape had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
“ We hadn’t decided what we should be like.
We were given a few instructions, but we tried to forget time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no game, we just loved each other, so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was that romantic?
“ Yes, it was a little romantic, ” says Atli and Asruna.
“ We were invited to drink champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the couple’s performance in the work that touched them.
“ When Tommi looked at it, he cried, and he thought it was so beautiful, ” says Atli.
“ This is as much about love as about the closeness as about the intercourse itself, ” says Asruna.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tells Atri that his mother heard the voice in his son’s Son at the Museum of Reykjavik and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns around and starts to think about it, ” says Atri.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that kind of thing, but then my dad just sent me a message, saying, ‘ It's good to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo, ’ says Asrún.
And would the participation in the work have deepened the relationship between Asruna and Atla?
“ At least we're still together, so maybe it deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with my family, ” says Asruna and laughs.
Asrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“ I found it a little difficult not to be with you, but with someone else, ” she says and turns to her husband.
“ But it was nice to see this because it is just one late in a much bigger job, and when you saw it with the other things, it's really cool.
I could cut a little off from this and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach, ” says Ásrún, who was pregnant of the second child of the couple when the sequential was taken up.
“It was just beautiful. ”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with Ásrúna and Atla in Love Stories on Channel 1.
Swansea with victory in the first play
Swansea won one to zero at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the playback to get into the English outfit.
The game took place in the Swansea homefield, Wales.
Half-play position was 0-0.
Swanseansean residents received a 64th minute hell, while Andre Ayew failed by the white point and was defended.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a player of Brentford, received the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game less than a man, and in the 82th minute, the players of Swansea took advantage of the difference.
Andre Ayew remedyed the scumbag by scoreing a great goal and guaranteed Swansea 1–0 victory.
So Swansea leads between 1 and 0, but the second game takes place next Wednesday at the homefield of Brentford.
No Ambassador for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador in Iceland, is in the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard, fearing his life.
However, the president of the United States has not been experiencing the challenge of appointing an ambassador in this country.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned from the U.S. ambassador at the end of April 2009, all of it has been ambassadorless in the country for 62 months, over five years.
Van Voorst resigned under strange circumstances, but Kastlys reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falcons.
On her way to a greeting meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the presidential office that she would not be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international communication with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst’s successor came to work, in September 2010.
In some respects, Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador, but then he resigned.
Eventually, Loius Ariega had served in the foreign ministry for decades.
Then, in the fall of 2013, he resigned from his work and accepted ambassador’s office in Guatemala.
Then there was another ambassadorless period.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015 and began to work shortly, but no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama’s votes.
As soon as Donald Trump took over the presidential office, January 20, 2017, as usual, with a politically appointed ambassador.
Trump rule was unusually long to appoint both ambassador and high-level officials in the Washington government system.
So two years passed until the U.S. Assembly announced Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him the questions and to confirm afterward as ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony at the Senate he said he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been broken by Dutch rocks.
Gunter is a politically appointed, formerly a skin doctor in California, and has been prominent in the Jewish organization of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson established them, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, where no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example of the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s government was to appoint people in key offices and that the last few years the United States Congress has been working very slowly, including the validation of ambassadors in office.
Thus, since 2009, for more than five years, there has been no ambassador in Iceland.
However, it has not prevented the operation of the embassy that recently opened a headquarters at Engage.
It is estimated that the results have cost about 6.5 billion, but the safety walls are surrounded by bulletproof glass in all windows.
It seems, however, not enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security, for he is said to be fearing his life and has desired an armed bodyguard.
Former player IBV suffered racism in Iceland - “It was a mistake to come to Iceland ”
Tonny Mawejje, former player of IBV, claims that he had had racism when he was in Iceland and regrets his arrival in the country.
This is seen in an interview with Tonny, who appears on the Uganda Media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team, who plays in Uganda’s top department.
During the Daily Monitor interview, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in the country, but he played with IBV, Val, and Sport in Iceland.
“ When I arrived in Iceland, I did not play in the middle as usual.
The leader of the team was in that position, but he also had the T-shirt number I wanted, so I didn't get anything of what I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with IBV.
Among the things Tonny talks about is racism in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“ This happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the case, and then I asked my friend what it was about.
He then told me that my opponent let racist talk about me after I accepted him."
In 2014, Tonny traveled from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he made the mistakes he regrets most.
Tonny had not made it to the first team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the country team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland for a loan, and he joined Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland on a loan.
I think if I had stayed longer in Norway, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland destroyed his dreams of getting into the big team in Europe.
Found a worm in the neck of a woman
Physicians at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3,8-foot black worm in the neck of a woman who searched there.
Physicians managed to pull out the worm with a tube.
A study revealed that there were parasites.
CNN reports this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before, a thin meat meal.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but such parasites are often in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, cases of infestation of parasites have increased since sushi has roasted in the western countries.
Fear that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now focused on concerns about the second wave of the Crown Virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to re-establish the spread of the Crown Virus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona, where infection increases.
Other European countries have also taken action because of the increase in the number of diseases in Spain, but in Britain, as in Norway, all have been warned about travels to Spain.
In France and Germany, there is also a growing number of infections, where governments try to find a balance in inhibiting the spread of the virus and resuming economic life.
However, the situation in Europe is good in other parts of the world, but the incidence of worldwide transmissions is nearly 300 000 a day, the most contagious in America and South Asia.
According to John Hopkins University, there are 16 million worldwide diseases that have been confirmed to be associated with the virus at 644 thousand.
Mosaic Works Are Finally Fully Enjoyed
In front of the Tollhouse in Reykjavik, there is a large and deep hole.
There are men with orange helmets on top of it.
There's also a big grave.
And more less engines.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the fortress is capable, and many now stop and view the arts of millions of mosaic chips — just as they have never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least not considered that.
So far, the work has been hidden, right in front of it was a parking lot that was always enclosed.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped off to do their business in the city.
The “multiple and variable public space” and “adorable city breeding” are a guideline for the regeneration of the current Safeguard.
The goal is to make the area more beautiful and to allow the Mosaic work of the Holy Lady of the Tollhouse to enjoy a better vision.
Before the job will be the marketplace and where the area is well suited to the sun, it is considered appropriate as a stay area for road users.
The artwork will be illuminated and will now make the wood more enjoyable than before on this 142 square feet [142 square meters] surface.
In this area, there will also be a small “cloud of fog, ” some kind of water sculptures, which offer a game and give the area a certain mystery.
In this way the reforms are described by the Reykjavik City, which is currently being carried out along with Veter.
Renewed water supply, heating and electricity.
Many of them have come to their ages, but the wastewater and cold - water layers have been since 1925 and have served in the city center for just a few years.
When the street is reopened after the work is completed, cars can drive around it again.
However, it will become a single road, and at the same time it will provide more quiet and accessible space for walking.
In a story about the Tollhouse on the customs official’s web, it was used in 1971, an architect named Gísli Halldórsson.
Because a seaside shovel reached through the house, 250 square meters of windowless wallpapers were formed out to the street.
A building committee and architect agreed that such flats would have a bad effect on the overall hole picture, unless special arrangements were made to decorate the house’s appearance.
Thus, the parties agreed to expect a permanent artwork to be set up there.
In that time, the summary reports a lot of the words made by Her Majesty, an artist.
If she had done a lot of musical work in Germany and elsewhere, she would have done much.
The decision was to contact her first before deciding whether the result would be a competition for the work.
Often it had been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the port, for the port had been the life of Reykjavik since it was made.
When talking to the artistic woman, she had to be impressed with such a work.
She agreed that she would receive drawings and other help before leaving a country, where she would work with the suggestions abroad.
A time was made for her, and when she returned home, she made a few suggestions for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the job.
At the same time, it was requested to make a complete contract with it and the famous German artwork company, the Oidtmann brothers, who had worked with them for a long time to set up famous artworks throughout Europe.
Contracts took place, and the art work was performed in the construction of the shops of the brothers who then set up the Customs Hall.
The entire work was extremely well done, both by the Maked Mother of the Holy Father and by the Oidtmann brothers, says the summary.
Ever since then, it has endured a relentless Icelandic weather.
It took Gör about two years to do the work that was done and started in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Tollhouse work was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing transport of more institutions to land
Asmund, Minister Einar Dadason, announces that more public institutions will be transferred to the shore in the near future.
That's what the Minister said in the bombing show at the Walker at lunch.
Recently, it was reported that the fire scene of the Housing and Manufacturing Agency will be moved north to Sheep Crown in the fall.
Six burn specialists work at the Agency, but none of them intend to follow the Agency north and have been criticised by firefighters and shippers.
“ I think we should take further steps in this realm.
I'm preparing for further steps in this realm.
More transportation," said Åsmundur.
Says he is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see the wider distribution of public institutions around the country.
“I think there is a need to make further political decisions on the transfer of public services to the country, as I was doing with the House and Manufacturing Agency, ” said Ásmundur, but he also made examples of other agencies that have been transferred to the country and were important for communities in the country, such as the transfer of the Food Agency to Selfos, the Iceland Measurers to Akraness and the unemployment insurance of the Skagast Beach.
All the Most Important From the Second Day of the Championship
94. Iceland’s Championship of Free Sports ended at Thorsvelli, Akureyri, today.
Some of the conventions were set on the second day of the race.
An exciting race was calculated in the battle of women in Thorsvangi, but Vigdis John’s daughter from the FH put Iceland Met in a stroke in 2014, which stood until Elizabeth Ruth’s daughter from IR added the estimate in May of last year.
Vigdis won the Iceland Estimate back earlier this summer and has been in fantaform lately, but she has threefolded the summer Iceland Estimate.
Elizabeth Ruth has been injured and has not recovered today.
She had only one valid flip of five, casting 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdis cast the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters [60.08 m] in her last experiment, and at the same time set a date.
Her iceland estimate earlier in July was 62.69 feet [62.69 m], so it was quite different.
The carite’s son Hallgrim’s daughter of IR had the second best shot of the day, but she improved her best result by a seizure of 50,18 feet [50.18 m].
In a man's group, the FH, Hilmar Örn Jonsson, won the Iceland Metal Sea, a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 yards in his next last pitch, and set a sign.
His iceland rating in the article is 75.26 meters.
The God of the God of God, the Olympic and the Iceland Meteor in a circus, won a ballcast on Thorspark yesterday, but today he competed in a broadcast that is his main issue.
The Iceland estimate of Godna Vals is 65,53 meters [65.53 m], but he threw 59,13 meters [59,13 m] today and secured his victory.
Valdimar Hjalti, the son of Erlend, was thrown next day, but he had one valid attack that worked in the second seat, 49.43 meters.
Havdis Winning Datter, Iceland Metro Sea, won the longitudinal contest with superiority, but Hafdis jumped 6,25 meters [6.25 m] today, about 40 cm [40 cm] from her Iceland Fame.
In the 200-yard race of women, it was the IR Godsaving Jonathan Bjarnat Datter who was bounced, but she came to mark in 24.04 seconds, but her Iceland Met in the article is 23.45 seconds.
The saver of Jonathan was a winner of Akureyri, but she won two gold prizes yesterday, in a 100 - yard race, and in a 4 - x 100 - yard message race, and then also in a 4 - x 400 - yard message race today.
In a male class, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson of FH was the first to mark in the 200 - yard race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Oliver Mon, son of Samuel of the Aar.
Like God save Jonathan, Kolbein Haded won gold at 100 meters yesterday as well as and in the 400 - yard race.
Doesn't get a fine for $27 million Bitcoin harvest
The Super-Tax Committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who claimed guilt for the underdeclaration of his financial contributions made for the sale of the Bitcoin electronic coin.
The committee concludes that a tax investigator had not given clear reasons for the need to fine the man.
The Committee’s decision states that the tax investigator considered that the man recovered materially wrong tax statements for the 2016 and 2017 revenue years.
He would have underlined his financial contributions that would have been made by the sale of the bitcoin electric coin, up to 27 million, either intentionally or with a magnificent lack of care.
Injure the man for his conduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the Committee.
However, he failed to sell electronic coins for 27 million in 2016.
In 2009 and 2010, he would have obtained it by burying it when it would have been easy and cheap with a regular home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electric coins, the tax resulting from such sales had been substantially unclear and unpredictable.
It would not have been possible to expect civilians to recognize such measures on tax claims.
He would not have avoided paying tax on the harvest, and he would have identified his ownership of a claim as an inventory on a currency account.
He would have asked both experts and government tax managers how this would be done, but with no success.
Then he felt that he had to be taken into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began burying Bitcoin.
So he would have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear view of.
The man considered that his taxes for these two years would be redetermined and stressed but otherwise not punished.
Then he repeated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in this country since 2012.
He would never have tried to escape his responsibilities in an unfair way.
The requirement for guilt would be in full measure and would put him in debt.
A breastwear echoes: “This man understands what football is ”
Andersen Willumsson's breastwear has been a lot between people's teeth, but it's also impressed because of his progress on the stage with a Breaky moment in the Pepsi Max Division.
The flashes will be on the fireline tonight when they meet the IA on the direct broadcast at Station 2 Sport.
A pancreas then takes out the playground due to four reminders in the season, so they do not play with a new haircut like in the games of the summer so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his head for the game at the HK last Thursday, which HK won between 1 and 0.
“ I don’t know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this was much better trying the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants the ball every time, and if there was someone going to settle this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Godmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max booty, when counted to Brynja.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ It is difficult at times to figure out what position he is in.
He looks a little out on the left when it begins to pass at the games, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hjorvar Hafledason.
Thorkell Moon Petersson tells Brynjevel real entertainment, and he welcomes the fact that he has such a colorful man in the department: “No one shares the fact that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and being always ready to come and answer in interviews.
There's an incredible number of people busy with him, who tells me that this man understands what football is.
“ I am an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews at Brynjelf, people are paying themselves in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said the month.
Player KR says he wants to leave the company - "I've been in touch with a few teams in B Division"
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in Pepsi Max, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the period in the home country, but for this, he must first quit his contract at the KR where the Danish department begins before the Icelandic probability.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and have shown a great deal of understanding, ” told Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“ I’ve been in touch with a few teams in the B division, and I’m probably going to change before the Iceland period ends.
There aren't many teams in Denmark who can allow themselves to pay up my contract at the KR."
Then he says that he is likely to have to face a reduction in his wages in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably experienced more the economic effects of the virus than in Iceland. ”
Björtmar has recovered a wheel for millions - now responding to DV review
For more than a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had an interest, unlike most others.
He smells up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric wheels, and bags.
Has Bjartmar earned the name “the bike whisperer. ”
Yesterday, when you published a story about your relationship with Bjartmar, it became a bit feathered.
In their discussions on the Facebook group of Western farmers, the DV reported that Bjartmar took the man to the Eastfield and said that the vespa might be stolen.
There was nothing else to read from the original writings of the electric shooter but that Bjartmar was the thief.
These texts have now been changed to Facebook and the original DV news header updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says original news of the case at all not illuminating what really happened yesterday in Eastfield.
Bjartmar claimed to have received information from the victim of electric firing that they were indeed their electric missiles.
This information was claimed to be owned by others, but the information proved wrong says Bjartmar.
“ I saw the guy, and I recognized the shuttle, even though there was an electric missile that had been missing for a very long time and had been searched for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him prepare to drive on the shuttle, I decided to hit the man to talk.
The owner was certain of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally, I'm very good at this, but before I got to finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word off."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric skirt immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the wheel and called the police himself.
“ Yes, great, ” said Bjartmar, “we'll just get this straight. ”
Then the owner of the electric launcher proved the owner of his electric launcher and started.
Later, as reported in the previous news, the right owner of the electric missile reported his story on Facebook.
In this more year, Bjartmar has been engaging in this practice, saying that he can count the times he encountered with people on one hand.
“ I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult men of Reykjavik, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are the longest of the smallest brothers and sisters in the community, addicts, mentally handicapped people, and other people who are somehow on the street.
“ The addiction is a hard master, and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, ” says Bjartmar.
“ My relationship with these people is really so good that I have brought many of the good people with me.
There are examples of people who went to treatment and then approached me and helped me with what I am doing, ” he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s communication with bikers is polite.
Some know about him and what he is doing, and offer peacefully to show him receipts, chair numbers, and so on.
Bicycle stealing is a major problem that has not been discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even directing people to talk to him because of stolen bikes.
Brightness is uncomfortable with previous DV news transmission and claims not to be one of the self-appointed police officers in personal search for justice.
Asking if he is not now on the hail of ice by his actions, and whether this is not the primary role of a police officer, Bjartmar certainly says.
“ Of course the cops are supposed to do this, but the fact is the cops are simply not doing this.
I've got to photograph the police running away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She's plainly said in these matters.
“ When the cops aren’t doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this issue, why not? ” asks Bjartmar.
He claims that he has been so successful in tracking stolen wheels that sometimes he encounters his “spirits ” on the street that they only corrected the Brighter Wheels they had previously recovered.
The times that Bjartmar has called for police help have happened to she simply not be present.
“ It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not my fault to the owners of the bikes, ” said Bjartmar, and it’s sad that the victims of bicycle thiefs have to suffer the emptyness of police in this class.
The results of Bjartmar are not shared.
Stories of people can be found thanks to Bjartmar for having regained their possessions.
Even Bjartmar says that the number of bicycles he has returned has long been lost, but the sums will probably run in millions, if not in millions of decades.
Weighing there electric sweeps, electric wheels, and electric shovels, electric wheels may cost up to half a million.
Brights work on a day in the theatrical school, and every other weekend he works in a community.
So his bike search is unpaid work that he does in his leisure time.
Social security funds and long shadows
In 2019 there was a big birthday year in the history of a pension fund in Iceland.
True, officials had received pension from the king of Dana from all the streets of the 19th century, but in 1919 the pension fund of officials eventually became the pension fund of all officials.
The foundation of the current pension funds of the general wages and salaries was then placed in a global labour market in 1969, where employment pension funds were provided for with compulsory and a valid fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
Then, in 1974, laws were laid down on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to expand.
The pension system of payers was not the only drastic change that the labor movement of the 20th century caused by its battle.
Unemployment insurance had been acquired in a similar way in a history of strike struggle in 1955, and the organization gradually achieved its health and health requirements, significant leave rights, shortening of working time, improvements in housing matters, and other important things.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle but proved to be much greater and more lasting than the increase in wages, which disappeared just as hard in the hut of inflation, which marked the postwar period and up to 1990 as many memories.
In 1969, the attractor to the creation of a general pension fund was both long and complex.
Although man finally came together about the fact that the funds were actually owned by a fund, the labor movement had to agree that their governments were appointed equally to representatives of professionals and fundmates.
In the next few years after the fund was set up, the majority of employees in the management of the funds were often discussed in the employees’ organization, but it was never achieved, and so we still have the abnormal arrangement that fund representatives are not in the majority of the funds governments.
Article 36 of the Act No 129/1997 on pension insurance and the functioning of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It says in the first quarter that “a pension fund is to be guided by a funder’s interests. ”
Also, the fifth issue says: “A pension fund must set moral standards in investments. ”
The shareholders of the Social Fund of traders include the following provisions, followed by the abovementioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is part of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and professionals in the western Sea and Europe.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good governance, can contribute to the improvement of investment income in stock collections.
In this way, the interests of investors and the goals of society will be combined in a wider context.
The LV considers it important that companies, especially those registered on stock markets, set a public policy on: maintaining a good governance choice of social and environmental responsibilities.
The pension fund Value, with the largest stocks of the country, has set up “the policy of responsible investments, ” and there are similar rules.
It's all recalled here as the introduction to the latest fashion word of the Icelandic, "shadow management".
Since the word is new, it is not hoped that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now “most taken: shade management is when a leader in a profession says in the press that he is going to send representatives of the Society in the management of the pension fund or instructions on how to take their position in a specific case.
If they do not comply with the recommendation, they will be dismissed at first time.
However, if the leader does not bring this into the media and does not talk about discontinuation, it is not “shadow management, ” since such communications are, of course, always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think of the way he feels “shadower. ”
In particular, two men have tried to shape this definition when it is written, on Saturday, July 25, 2020.
That's the Hard Egisson reporter on the Newspaper, and Ásgeir Jonsson, bank manager.
The motive of both occurred after Mr. Bogi Nils Bogason, director Icelandair, had told about his intention to terminate the association's agreements with airlines and airlines (resigning them), and Mr. Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Trade Association, sent them out the recommendation to the representative of the Society in the management of the Living Pension Fund of merchants not to support the potential purchase of shares in the company, or they might be dismissed.
Some time later, Bogi Nils drew his decision back, and afterward Ragnar Þór made his recommendations, which, of course, were based on Boga’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw a reason for multiplying the matter in the Friday newspaper News magazine in large words about shade management, lawbreaking, and a great need for changes in law.
There, though the blessed due had been connected and was quickly wiped out, the small doves were certainly to roll a heavy shed.
Since the matter is important, consider the matter itself at the end.
I looked at the things in the law on the pension fund that are involved in this matter.
These include the interests of financial corporations and the moral standards of investments, and these factors are detailed in the approvals of both the Value and the Social Fund of traders, as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look only at short - term profits in their investments.
Such a very dangerous policy would not have to be long looking for examples in the past, where large bank loans and cottages have flowed to immoral adventurers and environmental waste, with tragic consequences.
The president of Icelandair apparently was on the hails of ice when he thought to wipe out a whole group of employees, thereby significantly decreasing the favor that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position toward investors.
Happily, he saw and pulled it back.
Time reveals whether it is sufficient to allow an investment of a pension fund in the company to be considered responsible to fund companies at the end of the year.

One of the infected did not have a return diagnosis
One of the three diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic State on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Iceland, who is not regularly living here, so he did not receive clear instructions to carry out a so - called return assay after the arrival of the country and to take another sample a few days after the arrival.
He got a negative from the screening at the border.
“ But he is in a Icelandic community and is actually going to do that, ” says Kamilla Josep’s daughter, a medical specialist in the field of health care, and a surrogate of a clinician during his summer vacation, in a conversation with the Newspaper today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the identification number and if the identification number is not registered, you are not automatically announced in the second view.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, rather than because of his connection to the country as an Iceland, he should have used it as an Icelandic one.
But he did not realize that.
“ When the number is not recorded, you must seek to come in the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this was the right way, ” says Kamilla.
“ Thus, it is clear that we need to enhance the information we have on this as we find some way to make an automatic preaching system even though Iceland does not record its identification number.
Or then making it somehow more obvious who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system,” she explains.
Fortunately, though, a few people attended the country, although they were defined as participants in the Icelandic community, a resident of Iceland.
Only six have been sent to a custody after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They are going to take samples, but two of them have shown symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received negative results from his sampling at the border on July 15.
Kamilla is likely to say that he was recently infected by the virus that she could not yet be detected when the vision was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
“ It is not quite possible to claim that this is certainly an imported infection because it is a long time ago that he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like those two who have caused a little war in connection with the sports conventions. ”
However, she says that it is very unlikely because of the few people around here.
“ It’s really very unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but she states that it cannot be ruled out until the gene analysis of the human virus has been sorted.
“ If we have a virus type that hasn’t been seen here before, it is almost certain that he carried it to the country. ”
Piper Sprays and Bombs Against Protestants
There was a conflict between the police and the Protestant in Seattle last night.
The police used pepperspray and uncontinuous handcuffs, but the Protestants broke windows and set on fire.
45 Protestants were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudices were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one Protestant was shot to death.
As stated at BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
In Seattle thousands met in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a building area and broke windows in the courthouse.
As a result, the police said that the protests were upset, and there was a conflict between protestants and police groups.
The demand for justice in Aurora, Colorado, was Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man murdered by police in August last year, remembered by the Protestants.
A car ran through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black troops came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman murdered by a police officer in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and joined forces at closed gates, where the police were obligated to the group of protestors and also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where the Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white owner in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskin, football director Manchester United, doesn't want to overemphasise the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final round of the English election department.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea won't lose against Wolves, ends Solskin and his men to the fifth seat and then lose the Championship seat.
However, they would still hope to join the Championship Department by winning the European Division next month.
“ We haven’t reached the end station.
If we get a score against Leicester, I think people will say we've now not had a bad period," said Solskin.
“ But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey, ” said Solskin, “because we still have a lot to do by catching up on the two teams above us. ”
Clearly, at 15 a.m. today, the nerves of people are becoming thin, but Solskin tried to act as though each other game was a game.
“ If you want to belong to Manchester United, you must get used to being under pressure during the last game of the season.
It's nothing new, and it's based on this company.
We have made a great opportunity to end the season well, and now it's ours to use it," said Solskin.
“ This isn’t the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many hours to define this period."
“ The coming of Bruno Fernandes changed much for us, and I think that we are in better shape and much stronger spiritually than in the last season, ” said Solskin.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new virus viruses were detected in the United States yesterday, according to the University of John Hopkins.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
The virus killed 900 people yesterday, but the last four days to which deaths were due to the virus were more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths caused by the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
A report from CNN reports that according to the U.S. Profetics, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 on August 15, next.
Fear of the Second Wave of the Pandemic
Governments in Spain are now trying to refrain from increasing COVID-19 spread in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID–19, both on Thursday and Friday.
Since the beginning of May, no more have been reported in 24 hours, and the reports are coming at the same time as the Spanish begin to remove one of the strictest restrictions in Europe.
The relapse led to the British authorities now obligating passengers coming from Spain to patrol when returning.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation in Catalonia, in the northeastern part of Spain, is the worst, where governments have resorted to wider limits to try to step up growth.
In the capital of Barselóna, entertainment sites will be closed for the next two weeks, and wavehouses will be closed at midnight.
The ban is now valid for 200 thousand inhabitants of the Segria County in the west of Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative effect on the Spanish economy that relies largely on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly played after the epidemic.
Tui, the largest traveling office in the United Kingdom, canceled all the flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be prepared for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in resuming a large ban that has ruined the economy in many lands.
For example, the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has been very disliked and similar to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then, the French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the nation “will not survive, economically or socially, ” if the national ban was resumed.
In the future, many government officials hope that local resources that cover individual towns, cities, or regions will be sufficient to keep the virus back in the next round.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Domestic Diseases
Three internal infections were detected yesterday, plus two more at the border.
That's how five people were diagnosed with a positive Covid-19 infection yesterday in Iceland.
In the public protection announcement, one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football convention.
He has been sent to isolation and sixteen close associates with him in a clinic.
The infected person was a member of the social work of a Reykjavik sports company and is, according to the announcement, “only a part of the sports team” in the clinic.
Others who were sent to a custody have a different relationship with man.
The origin of this infection is unfounded and infectious infectious infectious teams of the State Marshals.
The conventioners of the ReyCUP have followed the instructions and regulations of the clinician and public protection still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
Yet, pictures of the convention were attracted to the attention of a very close association to celebrate their good team in the field.
Just before 11:00 a.m. today, the participants published the following notification on their Facebook page.
It says: “Children, please respect the rules that competitors pick up their own things at school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
"Thank you for showing understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection reported in the previous day.
Says in the announcement: “Islenian genetic analysis has analyzed the infection and has detected a new type of virus that has not been detected here before. ”
Infection has also been achieved in this case, as it was infused in isolation and 12 in the infestation of the infection.
The third infection discussed by a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15, 2012.
He was detected on the southwest corner of the land.
He is now in isolation, and six close associates with him in a divorce.
Two of them have already shown symptoms of virus infection.
In addition, two cross-border detected and are awaited for further studies such as cross-border activity pathways.
Finally, the announcement states: The National Police Department and the Office of the Governor urge people to be careful and to take care of individual protection.
If there is no doubt whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same one is asked to take a sample at the next health centre.
Patreksfjärd says the campsite booked about commercial weekends - direct guests
The campsite in Patreksfirdi is booked for the weekend, according to the Western Resident’s notice.
Visitors are advised to look at other gigs.
For example, western Bildu Valley, Falcon feather, Melanes of the Red Spirit, Hotel Flekalund, and Hotel Breitavik as another option in the situation.
It is enough to be at Patreksfird this weekend, for as in previous years, a Shield city, a festival of Icelandic documentary held in town.
Since 2007, it has become a strong tradition in town.
As a result of the pursuit of the tent area, it is expected that this year would be a good event if the weather does not make a point, but DV said earlier today of a terrible prediction.
However, the worst weather in the south can be expected, and hope for the Patreks.
The web bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodations in town were already booked full.
A house full of houses ponds down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free of charge at Dunhaga 18–20.
In the meantime, owners are seeking building permits for rehabilitation, but their business has flourished in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods of Reykjavik City, there is a lofty house on three floors.
The floor of the house is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house is the door of two stairways, each containing four rather beautiful apartments.
They are between 93 and 130 square meters, although most over 100.
The house has a lot of history.
It was built in 1959, including a video rent, a school room, a dairy store of the Milk Sales, a gunmaker of Joa, a fish seller, and now a recent college graduate.
The house has been remembered by the faintness of its beauty, so as to speak mildly.
The house is now under great damage, as shown in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 are according to a business register among others Magnús, the son of Magnú, and the Godrún of Helga, the daughter of Lárus.
Michael led the paying group and defended the property company Payment.
A part of the property company Payment is a steel ship ehf.
A steel ship, eh., is the investment company of Godrúna Helga Lárusdótter and her children.
And the owner of the third part of the D18 ehf.
Godrún and her husband, August Gudmund, the son of Sigurd, once ran the construction of a steel ship.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009, and so little as nothing has been held with since then.
Neighbors say that the house’s condition has progressed ever since, but mostly in recent years.
On a Facebook - page residents in the neighborhood, one resident says that the house “was not very lively in the last few years. ”
It may be that the owners have been struggling for a few years to change the house and the land.
Other neighbors say the house has not been okay for a long time.
“ It’s a long time to do something nice about this spot and boring that it’s been attracted like this. ”
In addition, he says that he is angry with the owners of the house for not having driven himself into finishing it, finding a common surface with the neighbors of the house, and quit this “Justice Stab. ”
“Just do this in consultation with the community around so that we can hurry up and finish it.”
The “Secretary Step” which is prepared to refer to is the organisational process of the field that has been in operation since 2017 at least.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 sought permission to build a height on the current building and behind the house, a new elevator house, and a one - floor building, as well as a basement.
The prior building permit was filed to the Environmental and Resources Committee and removed it from its validity where the implementation was not supported by a divisional structure and the annexation was insufficient.
Then the city of Reykjavik began organizing and finished it with an announcement in the Governance News in July of the year.
That organisation was also accused and suspended by the Committee in March 2020.
Thus, at this point, nearly three years had passed since the original application for the building permit and the owners of the house at the starting point.
At that time, the house had been devastated considerably, and neighbors were getting tired.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house into the situation, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the purpose of the house’s ownership, others at all not.
Others directed anger toward the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but nothing necessarily had to do with anyone.
Still others said the parking lots apple, but neighbors have been using the unused parking lot of Dunhaga 18 to 20 under their vehicles.
One prosecutor said long - suffering in the government:
“ That we have to go through the process for three times is quite incredible.
It's like Reykjavik City couldn't read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
Reminded about the city’s modern government and the noble expectations of the owners and the years of the work of those who are now at the start.
When a reporter at Dunhaga 18 came to his sight, he was exposed to open doors and trash piles.
Playstation computers and recent TVs were among other garbage on earth — victims of a Icelandic summer flush.
There was an open door to the old college executive office, and there a number of cats of the urine smell to judge.
Clearly, someone has been nestling in one corner, but no one is visible.
Staples of sofas and beds and a few boards of geographic pages, which were undoubtedly going to become a book, noticed.
At the same time, the stairways of the house were open and life in them both.
A journalist was so lucky to meet the people of one of them.
There the Romanians were cooking potato dishes for dinner and invited a journalist.
The rooms work for Ztrongforce's staff hire.
They have been there for some time and simulate DV's evidence that the company has paid nothing for the household except heat and electricity.
Because of the situation of the house, it does not seem justified to collect rents.
From postal positions in the front door of the house, it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers in the past.
The business of staff rentals has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, whereas a contract in tourism led to a contraction in the construction sector, and these two industries have been the most difficult to take advantage of the service of employees.
Nevertheless, after a long day of work in the rain, the householders at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do, and the workwrecks and wrecks were hanging in the share to dry.
It is noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be the fine maintenance.
When a reporter said goodbye to the boys in Romania, the ironic suddenly became clear: In the best place in Reykjavik, 1,500 square meters of property is depleted.
Owners want to change the house to improvement, and neighbors want to improve the situation, but they want to argue about the definition of "better."
The city's organisational field is then at the start, the victim of endless appeals and the appeals in the organisational process and the liquidation of the Environment and Resources Committee's resolution.
In the house, the Romanian workers, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation, are living when the Iceland stops fighting.
The article was originally published in DV on July 17th.
In the fight against overweight following a coronary virus epidemic
The United Kingdom Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on urgent invitations, following serious illness, partly because of its weight.
It says that tomorrow, on Monday, Johnson’s campaign, is known as Better Greeting, but during the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycle rides for their clients in overweight, and they will also be attacked in the fight against the growth of bike trails.
Then, according to British media sources, advertisements on television will be banned before 21 a.m.
“CoVID-19 has raised us against short and long-term risks of overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must spend time on becoming healthier, more effective and eating healthful food,” said the government spokesman.
Johnson himself has had gravity problems, but he was put into intensive care when he was infected by the crown virus in spring, and it is part of his weight because he is considered to have been so severely affected.
Women Better Introducing Changes
She said that the new Constitution was the greatest step that the nation could take towards greater sovereignty, transparency, and against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“ We need to change some gear now, and who is better able to lead such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
It's women," said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s unity.
Stand together and be together in conducting changes.
So it's only time for us to lead these changes."
She said she was a little alarmed about the emphasis on Iceland as “the best in the world ” in both gender equality and human rights.
“ Then we are not as ready to see what we need to do.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we come from, know the story, and listen.
Listen to the voices of border groups.
We don't live with the same rules all here," said Helga.
The question said that women are in many ways good in Iceland, but she added that, as in many other places, the Iceland has great male values.
She said that politics turned to picture their own interests, authority, and authority, which were the forces that maintained discrimination in all communities.
“ Women have now set up this group and come together and are just getting a little annoyed about the fact that the General Assembly is going to overlook this national contribution since 2012, ” she said.
“ It is these female values that we are thinking about.
Based on human rights and natural protection, cooperation and the fact that we all sit at the same table, she said and added that the above values are the basic values of the new Constitution.
“ We are a very rich country of natural estate, and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can differently," said Helga.
“ It is ridiculous that it is a natural law that women’s jobs are always less paid.
It's ridiculous that flight maids and nurses have to be in a battle for a lifetime just to get a decent salary."
The signature list of the new Constitution can be signed here through electronic Iceland.
Trying to rob a walking walker in the city
A man was arrested in the city of the city last night after he threatened walking roadfarers and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Årby, where two were arrested for the case.
Then the police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in the Hills where its driver was at a speed of 146 km at a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to do this night, and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from yesterday to five this morning.
There was a special announcement of noise on the part of a party.
On Saturday night, 11 noisy gatherings were announced, and it was very important in the police diary.
Tonight, however, 22 noises were roaring at a police table.
Six were stored in a cell last night.
In the city city, police were called to the city tonight when people fired fireworks.
However, they had already escaped when a police officer came to their homes.
Nine drivers were then stopped for drunkenness and drug driving.

Besides, police officers stopped the driver who pulled a trailer at Kjalarnesi yesterday.
According to the police diary, the wheelchair was in “very bad conditions, ” and it was still.
You can stay in Monet's house for the weekend of merchants
The house in which the impressor Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his training is now rented on the page Airbnb.
The next night in the house is about the weekend of merchants.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry, Normandie, France.
The world famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two bedrooms, and three bathrooms.
First, Monet was inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If anyone intends to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Based on the page Airbnb, it is next free in a week, on the Sunday of the merchant weekend, so it might be ideal for some traders on vacation to go to book the painter’s house.
The two merchant weekend nights cost only $964 in the United States, or just over $130,000 in the next issue of the News magazine.
Differents and some of them are beginning to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the crown virus
Five have been diagnosed with the inland corona virus in the last three days and most of the infected have not been associated.
Thousands of people have been sick because of this, and some of them have shown signs and symptoms of the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the Crown Virus inland yesterday and two at the border range.
According to a medical expert, the growing number of internal infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely into society.
“ There has been a series of differentials from the previous infestation, and there is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no special reason to think that it has been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but, of course, we need to be very careful now," said Camilla Sigriur Joseph’s daughter, a specialist in the field of health care in the local court.
Most of these have been infected with individuals from abroad.
More samples will be carried out in the near future than some who were in association with the infected have shown symptoms of the crown virus.
“Now, ” said Kamilla, “there is no flu and there are other respiratory infections, so we can be quite free to do these tests on individuals who at the time of the influenza would have found reason to do something else first. ”
Infection is mostly complete, but it is not impossible that more people have to go to the clinic.
Two of the infected were detected after attending sports events.
Has it raised questions as to whether such events are justified?
As long as people comply with standards and rules, the public Protector says it slowly.
Kamilla says virtually impossible that the infected were infected at the sports conventions.
“ If there’s no more isolation from these individuals after being around them at these sports conventions, we can claim that our conventions were effective.
But it hasn't been found," said Kamilla.
The work of the Public Protection Department is under constant review.
“ We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or limitations, ” said Kamilla.
In more than a week, there will be a number of limitations to accommodate a thousand people.
This new situation could affect the ability to act.
"Definite meditation to cook" - See Elisha Vedar's menu
Elisha the daughter of Vedar is a prominent football player playing with Val.
She is also a master student of nutrition, a mother, and serves as a food expert.
It needs a lot of energy for the day, and it usually takes time to cook good and nourishing food.
My normal day starts by coming to work at eight," says Elisha.
“ After work, I go to the store to prepare my dinner before I pick up my girl at the theatre at three o’clock. ”
Elisha finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early in the theatre.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to the second part exercise.
After practice, it's good to come home and just have to warm up.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one part to empty our mind."
Elisha does not follow a diet.
Since she is finishing a masterpiece in nutritional science, she knows well how to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family, and exercise.
“ What suits me is eating a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates, and fat.
However, I find it most important to have a healthy relationship with food, not to classify food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It's all right to eat everything, just not all of a sudden and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I think it’s a matter of meditation to stand in the kitchen and make a lot of cooking.
I have to say that confidence is with me in the kitchen and I really believe I'm a fine cook."
Breakfast: Hawks, chia seeds, hamp seeds, salt, a little citric juice, put in almond milk overnight.
The top of this meal, then, by what is available each time.
Usually it is banana and jumping mouse & coffee.
I'm a lot of coffee.
Intermediate: Unbelievable differences, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, pure bananas and muslims, a bread with a leg, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if so.
Breakfast: I often prepare for food - rich salads from what is in the fridge, quinos, or barley, falafels, rock salad, superb vegetables with a good dressing is a bit of what I am working on.
If the organization goes completely out of hand (which often occurs), then the egg machine at work has saved me quite often, and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese, and cooked eggs, no more.
Intermediate: Give me some carbohydrate for exercise, a bread with a beetle, breakfast, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will be very often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Fight between police and Protestant in Seattle
The city authorities of Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of rebellion following massive protests in the city.
Yesterday, the police seized a flammable bomb and pepper spray to try to eradicate a large area that the Protestants took over and extended across many buildings in the neighborhood of the city council.
The police announced on Twitter that at least 11 Protestants had been arrested and that there was an investigation on the damage done at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some sort of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that the Protestants stoned the police with stones, bottles, shell bombs, and other loosely, and were taken to a hospital where his injuries were done.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They were encouraged to show a unity of protestants in Portland, Oregon, where there has been repeated conflicts between Protestant and heavy - armed federal police forces.
As in more cities in the United States, people gather under the marks of Black Lives Matter, George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protests systematic racism in the American community and demands improvement.
Not revoked until after syllable payment
Still there is no question whether the resignations of the Icelandair flightmaid, who are to take effect at the next month’s convention, will be revoked.
Icelandair's airmaid will end at noon tomorrow.
Godlaug Liney Joannsdaughter of the Society assures himself that Icelandair will not decide on the termination until the conclusion of the vote is in place.
“ This clearly hangs together, ” says Godlaug Liney.
“ There have been no withdrawals; this must be done so that the machines can be manned.
Of course, people are anxious to find out if they will be working after the monthly convention."
The kiss is for a contract signed before the week, by the end of July 19th.
It is assumed to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract previously signed by pilots in a vote.
On July 17, Iceland’s Airmaid Society’s Government and Confidential Council agreed to announce Icelandair’s Icelandair’s military work stop in a vote.
She never came to her, but this was decided after Icelandair’s decision to stop talking to the Airmaid Society, quit all his flightmates, and search for agreements with another class community.
At that time, the company’s pilots were required to take on temporary security personnel.
Ask her how she thinks that the vote will go, says Godlaug Liney hard to say about it.
“ After Icelandair’s mission, people are in wounds when all the company’s airlines were dismissed and announced that they would be negotiated with another class community.
Now we'll find out if it's an effect," she says.
At the end of April, 940 pilots worked for Icelandair, which was 900 of them, some 95%, quit.
Their resignation is not long; for those who have a shorter life, he is three months, and therefore ends at the July convention.
There are about 90% of Icelandair pilots in this group.
What will not take place if the contract is not agreed?
“ Then we would like to keep talking to our congregators.
With this deal, we are meeting Icelandair's demands.
"If he is rejected, it is clear that the pilots seem to have gone too far."
End of the vote on the Treasury Agreement and tomorrow Icelandair presents the settlement of another quarter of the year
The flight lady's vote on a new contract ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
The breakdown of Icelandair for another quarter of the year will also be published tomorrow, but the preliminary findings indicate that the company's income has decreased by 85 per cent from the same period of last year.
Electronic votes on the Iceland Airmaid Association and the Icelandair Association were launched on Wednesday, July 22, and ended tomorrow, Monday, July 27th, at 12 noon.
Those who may vote on the contract are the staff of Icelandair who pay social fees to the Airmaids.
Icelandair and the FFI signed a new cooperative agreement on Sunday, July 19, but Friday before, Icelandair had terminated the discussion with the company after the pilots collaborated the previous agreement in the vote at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair had told all the pilots and crews of the company on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new contract was signed.
According to a new nuclear contract, pilots need to fly five hours more a month for the same basic salary.
The Charter Agreement applies to 2025, where pilots and airmaids have been integrated for how long to fly on a single shift.
The agreement was introduced to FFI members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and described many flight officials that a news office discussed with them about dissatisfaction for the contract.
Most of them, however, seemed to agree that the agreement would have to be agreed to keep the FAIF alive.
The settlement of Icelandair for another quarter of the year will be introduced tomorrow, but the EBIT Society, its financial and tax business, is a negative result, according to the provisional restrictions, of $100 to 110 million U.S.A., or about $15 billion.
Icelandair sent a temporary calculation to the Buy Hall last Wednesday, where it said that the company’s income amounted to some $60 million in a quarter or $8 billion.
The hand - bearing money and the equivalent of it have been about $154 million at the end of the quarter, about $21 billion.
At the same time, Icelandair is seeking to offer its shares in August.
Icelandair is aiming to conclude agreements with fifteen creditors, governments and Boeing aircraft manufacturers before the end of the month before a partial bid.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“ A new virus just means that it has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been malfunctioning in the country, ” says Már Kristjánsson, a head doctor of the Hospital’s Disease Department, about the reports that “new virus ” has been detected here in the country.
Three internal infestations were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the social work of a sports community at the Rey Cup football convention, but the source of the infection was unfounded, and there was an infectious attack.
In addition, a person who arrived in the country on 15 July was diagnosed with two interacting with him and began to show COVID-19 symptoms.
Then yesterday, a virus related infection reported in the previous day and following a serial analysis in the Icelandic gene analysis was detected “a new type of virus that has not been detected in the past”.
Infection has been completed in association with this infection.
A moose claims that this is not a new virus, but is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is more appropriate to speak of a new variant of that virus than of a new kind of virus.
Asking what it means and if it could say anything about the beginning of another wave of the epidemic, Maur says that as in a single case, it may not be more.
“ However, if there are cases in the country that do not have a foreign relationship and have the same genotype as this particular variant, it would be possible to draw that conclusion [about a second wave] but it is untimely at this point, ” explains Már.
Happiness in the hot pot
Is the secret to Iceland's happiness hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC programming leads to the likes of a fun video that sheds light on the country's swimming pool and hot pot culture.
The Iceland bathing culture is special worldwide and is claimed to be nowhere in the world to have as many bathing places in each of the inhabitants.
The natural heat is its foundation, but also its tradition for swimming.
Children’s disabilities were legally legal in 1940, but older citizens are also diligent in using hot water to improve their health.
Dizziness is described as a solid part of the country’s general welfare.
In the pot, everyone's equal, regardless of class and position.
When we are free from the mobile phones, people talk personally around the home and space or enjoy the gracious power of the water: meditating and loading the batteries of the soul and the body.
On the brat to pick up a hundred days in the elections
A hundred days are until the Americans vote and choose their president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he has the brat to pick up.
Joe Biden, the probable candidate of the Democratic Party, has a high precedence for Trump in the countryside, based on surveys.
According to a new survey by the AP, the population of the U.S. believes that the nation is in the wrong way.
Trump’s reaction to the world pandemic of the new Crown Virus is also very unacceptable, and in addition, more Americans than in the past believe that the President had a negative attitude toward economics.
In more detail, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right path.
32 percent claim to support Trump’s response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say that he has maintained the economy well.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average of FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 per cent in the countryside, followed by Trump 41.9 per cent.
Trump himself has tried to divert the attention from his performance of the epidemic to Biden, promote so-called cultural disputes, and pronounce policies that are to turn to law and order.
However, Biden’s promotion is keen to keep Trump’s attention, counting a great probability of winning if the election is actually about how Trump has been working in the last four years.
The opposers of Trump seem also to be coming down on the members of the Republican Party and fear that the Democrats could even reach the majority of the United States Senate, which so far has been very unhappy.
Politico reported in the day - to - day reports that the success of groups and candidates would be similar, and that is now the Republican group would receive its greatest despair for decades.
The suburban has been particularly bad in the 2016 parliamentary elections, and now it appears that this development will continue.
Trump has tried in recent days to scare the residents of suburbs to follow him, including by saying that becoming President Biden, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and promote racial conflict.
Among other things, Trump has suspended a regulation since the time of Barack Obama in the White House, which was intended to increase the diversity of suburbs.
Then he urged “wifes ” of the U.S. suburbs to read an article from New York’s former Deputy Governor, who claimed that Biden would destroy the American suburbs and took Trump in mind.
“ Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even do it even better!" said the president.
The population of the U.S. suburbs is a growing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half the voters in the United States.
Since the re-election of George W. Bush in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney received most votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
The surveys have shown that despite the fact that Trump secured a small majority in the suburbs in 2016, his follow-up there has fallen considerably.
Although there are varied differences between the surveys, Biden has recommended a fifteen - percent precedent of Trump in the recent suburbs.
Regis Philbin is dead
U.S. TV, Regis Philbin, is dead at 88 years of age.

Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the hallways?
After the final decision had been taken to postpone the Olympic Games, events that have only led to world wars, the president of the International Committee of the Olympics said that the Olympic Fire would be “the light at the end of the hallways, ” referring to the probable world - inhabited coron virus that the world is now fetching together.
Professional workers have another year to prepare, and Japan’s authorities increase their costs because of the delay.
However, everyone keeps his head at risk.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the scene of the Olympic Games for this year, the Japanese representatives were genuinely excited.
They cried and laughed, since Tokyo had applied for the 2016 plays, but once in a lower way for RIO, Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to bathe in the world’s attention.
The games were to take place on July 24 to August 9, which has been postponed for a year, starting on July 23, 2021 and ending on August 8.
If they fail to keep playing, if the crown virus still becomes too threaten, the games will be stopped.
Yet, no one wants to think that to the end.
Olympic games are not a regular sports contest.
There is nothing saved, the show should always be wonderful and endeavoring to top the last games.
The city chosen for Olympic Games is based on the assessment by the election committee of the city's presentations.
The more magnificent the presentation — the more probable it is.
Tokyo spent $ 150 million trying to maintain the Olympic Games in 2016 or over $20 billion.
The second time, when the games were applied for in 2020, $75 million, about $10 billion, was placed in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo had been given the games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent $30 billion on the project.
However, the amount is just a drop in the sea according to the cost of building the Olympic villages, the stadiums, and in general to strengthen the country’s invasion to handle such conventions, to prepare it, and to keep the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which were supposed to be running these days but have been postponed for one year because of the crown virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by a government auditor in Japan published at the end of the last year showed that the cost is almost double that number.
Although the cost of postponing the games may not be fully assessed, it has been estimated that it could cost a further two to six billion dollars at the original cost.
Thus, the total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
It is so high that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic State only amounted to about half the Olympic Games, given the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of the degree that they have often become the subject of economists, who try to look at numbers and see the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, many seem to have concluded that the effects of the Olympic Games are less favourable to the economy of the cities that hold them.
Short - term effects are some, for example, increasing the number of jobs in a very short period of time, but for a long time, cities tend to live with debt gaps and a horror - high operating cost of low-used manpower.
Rio, Brazil, has had serious debts because of the games in 2016 and has been in trouble with maintaining all the major athletes built for the games.
Numbers have been examined after the London Games in 2012, which has shown that only 10 percent of those who got jobs related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
This means that there was only a small number of new jobs.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in keeping the Olympic Games financially because of the cost of the manpower built for the plays.
However, the benefits are often thought to be the result of an increase in tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, which is still very uncertain about the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain whether all the audiences who usually attend the games will be able to accept.
The main issue, however, is the honor that the cities have to be chosen, but it is difficult to value money.
In spite of enormous expenses, the joy that the games bring is not in the sense that it can be valued.
Of course, it is not just about money, but it is often magnificent and nowhere to be saved.
It's the sports heroes in the foreground.
For some survivors, it is only an accident to postpone the games.
For example, the Australian feminist and a golden prize winner in his article on the page Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, is a casolette and would have been far from a good fun for summer, but hopes to be in a race form for the 2021 games.
So it is among those athletes who are just rather pleased with the postponement for understandable reasons.
For the athletes who planned to quit after the plays this year, if they were held at the right time, in some cases, the postponement of the games means that they quit the race before the games take place.
Just don’t trust your body to go through another year of strict exercises.
Few athletes found themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of the audience at the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 as Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended some interviews in his country of origin in the United States recently to discuss the Olympic Games.
She’s planning to play 2021, but she’s not necessarily sure that she’ll still be at the top of the games next year, and she’ll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a gymnastic woman in the foremost row.
“ This is a sensitive matter, ” says Biles, but she smiles to another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee, asking whether she intends to reach the 2021 games as she did in Rio 2016.
“ I simply don’t know if I’ll still be on top after another year of practice, ” says Biles.
She has said before that her body cannot endure the pressures of gymnastics much longer.
Nevertheless, she is exercising zealously for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop practicing suddenly when the pandemic was at its highest and the classroom was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles as well as for others while all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others; she had to find ways to keep herself in shape as others did.
Certainly, the basic form is a little better than that of most people.
“ We have a rigid plan now.
It was hard to start rehearsaling first after the classroom opened.
We started slowly, but we're resumed, and after the year, I will increase my exercises steadily.
Of course, we do not know exactly what these games will be like, or whether they will be held, but we do practice in view of the fact that they will be, that is all we can do.
I've done too much to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With it, like other people, doubt or perhaps more conscious of the situation that the games may not be held in 2021 at all.
However, predicting it is hopeless.
In July 2021, no one can know the world pandemic situation of the Crown Virus, and nothing else to do than prepare for the Olympic Games in a year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid walks.
Deferred Marriage for Pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry the former Bachelorette competitor Well Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about right now, ” said the actor in a conversation with People.
“ We would really like to get married sometime and have our dream wedding and have all those present who love us.
But we decided to delay it and focus on what is important right now, and it helps us to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more at world affairs than the wedding affairs these days.
There's a lot going on and we're supposed to focus our attention on what's happening in the world."
