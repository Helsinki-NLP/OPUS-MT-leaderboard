AM in Wales is worried about "appearing like a puck"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused by a proposal to change their title to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal comes on the basis of plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
AM throughout the political spectrum is worried about being ridiculed.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers who don't know the Whalesian: Twp means stupid in Whalesian and Pwp means shit.
One AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative waliser said that his group is "open" for the change of name, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in W in W in W in English, like the letter U in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, currently compiling legislation for the change of names, said: "The final decision for what members of the congregation should be called is clearly up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Walisian Congregation the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly for the Parliament of Wales.
In the case of the title of AM, the Commission proposed the Members of the European Parliament ( Members of the Wales Parliament) or the WMP, but the MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AM obviously proposes other options, but problems of reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, which is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes in how the congregation works, including rules for the disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what to call them when they debate legislation.
Macedonia holds a referendum on the change of the country's name
On Sunday the voters shall vote on whether they are to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia Görge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the change of names and has said that he will ignore the result.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's are silent when the churches in Harlem encounter a problem
"Older people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there is neither or."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People hang out in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Barer is no longer like the area's living room, where people go on a regular basis."
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as far as the leaders expect and that " sooner or later they will end up on the square one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with ownership apartments filled with people who do not help the remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closing of all churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not be members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropol – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation with a nearby church took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a bojkott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when the pastor Johnsons congregation planned the renovation, they also built the watch game.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the watches of the poor."
The expert who played the clock game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the past few months at St. Martin's are a complex history of architects and entrepreneurs – some hired by the church's playmanship, others of the episcopal stift.
The Church House – the governing body of the congregation consisting of laymen – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed an concern that the foundation would "try to transfer the cost" to the church assembly, despite the fact that the church assembly had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Sharks hurt 13-year-olds who dive for lobster in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who came after lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7:00 in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy screamed, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that all the key legs had been torn up.
"I cried to everyone to get out of the water. 'It's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was flying to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is indicated to be critical.
It's unclear what shark it was.
Bathkeeper Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim had trauma damage on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's enters the UK Beauty Market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with commodities like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the decline of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty courses will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the attempts made by supermarketers to fill the shelves that were previously taken up by TVs, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's said they intend to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offers from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with selected areas, as in shops like Boots.
The store chain also re-launchs its boutique brand so that most of the products are vegan – as more and more young customers demand.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test stands in two Sainsbury's stores – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that quick purchases must do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look increasingly like a store in an attempt to fight cheap stores such as Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stand in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which have increased the sales of food and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facial lift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 21st century, but cooperation ended after a dispute about how the revenue of Boot's sales in the supermarket would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns Lloyds Pharmacy chain, £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can provide customer advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in smooth places we are now a attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "rasing" after Holly Willoughby retires from a deal of £11 million
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones is "smart" because the TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out of a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time with their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons the Star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing their lucrative lifestyle mark in the last minute – to focus on their new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became "raising" at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new agreement – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she could no longer focus on their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and expected double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she left Truly at Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was definitely Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at the headquarters of Marlow."
Experts believe that this Morning representative's decision to withdraw may cost the company several million due to significant investment in everything from pillows and light to clothing and the risk of further delays in launching.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as President in March.
The couple are together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
One source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Tough talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "invaluable a president" and for being so positive about the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a news anchor voice:
"I haven't given up anything."
He said that Kim wants a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a big step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stuck.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diploma Ri Yong Ho said to the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "corresponding response" from the United States after the first disarmament step in North Korea.
He noted that instead the United States continues to impose penalties intended to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"Northern Korea is doing great," he said.
"We were about to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim has had positive results – an end to rockets, liberated hostages, and returned remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-packed arena, we would have about 200 people here," Trump said and pointed to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake on Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombox population had lost their homes, there was no exception permit, which is necessary for international assistance.
"In many cases they have unfortunately been very clear about not asking for international help, which complicates everything," said Ms Sumbung.
Save the children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman of the natural disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
Given the constant earthquakes of Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the anger of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The lack of a Tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions it is a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital vessel that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and train rides.
But lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration before next year's elections.
Mr Joko is also under pressure by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge signed in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a target for 89th minute in Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's target when his team was left with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick to the outer pole.
The attempt flew high across the target area towards the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's hope and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get in a position to access the ball and players that Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and thought not so much about it, but just kicked."
Chelsea led by 1-0 after the first half-time after a goal in the 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue strikeer healed a passport back to Mateo Kovacic, spinned off near the middle field and swept to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the middle field.
Then he got a great kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran from the defense and got the ball in the net at the outer pole with a left-footed kick past Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Napoli in the group stage of Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is faced with Videoton in Uefa Europe League in London at 15:00 a.m. on Thursday.
Death rate for tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death rate for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the National Disaster Agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to have stuck in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake of 7.5 that hit Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, said the office's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was full of broken buildings.
The police are arrested, 32, suspected of murder after a woman was murdered.
A murder investigation has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with knife wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to appear.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspect to contact us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a real estate.
During the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman has arrived to the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and the police are informing the victim's nearest relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can get into or get out of the building.
He got speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it takes several hours to get back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up in the place.
She says, "It's so horrible" over and over again.
At 2:00 there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another outside.
A number of police officers were in the lock-up with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of the Cromwell latest victims of disputes about the rewriting of history
A banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatic puritanic followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "dirty" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The Ikonoclasm during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Fel Cromwell might be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the 19th century's opinion and is part of the historic history of a man who many people still think should be honoured.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "More people, perhaps at the end of the 1800s, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person representing one side of the matter.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Murderer pig kills farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, who is identified only with his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines in pigs in a pighouse on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunna on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a pig house nearby was open.
He said there was a big pig male in the pork with blood on his mouth.
A technical investigation confirmed that the 250 - kilo - heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and distorted," said the cousin identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the site.
Yuan's family and those responsible for the market are reported as negotiating compensation for his death.
It's rare for pigs to attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and caused serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kilograms pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can function as a "catalysator".
"They're just playful.
They're napsy, they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
Rests of Hurricane Rosa for extensive heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, the hurricane Rosa becomes weaker when it travels across cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwestern America in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a train begins to form over the Pacific Sea and travel east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Half Island Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching tray will create vastly heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Local rain will cause dangerous floods, clay flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will result in 5–7.5 cm rain per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwest of the United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is certainly not recommended that anyone go to foot in the desert when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can make canyons swiming rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching tray seems to bring local rain to parts of the southern coastline of California.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and tail roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rainfall period.
Some scattered tropical rainfalls will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain gets wider later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will be spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue during Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States when the Arctic is cooled but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central US on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to get a warm start on October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the northeastern USA.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
More than 20 million people looked at Thursday's gripping testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political state of death continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday's last minute Twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI where they got a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's absolutely sure that Kavanaugh was hitting on her when he was drunk and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers in Friday was higher than the 20.4 million mentioned by Nielsen.
The average number of viewers counted on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks that showed the interrogation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people looking from offices.
Compared, there are as many viewers as for a football game in the final game or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the daylong interrogation, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the next of 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the interrogation.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS demonstrators filmed who shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator for an interrogation with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators shouted at him, which was shown in the direct transmission of CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed, he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether they would bring Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he was only going to do this if the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominator in the coming week, which the minority Democrats have requested.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched a FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the future of Britain and to undermine the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect each other's customs charges was "completely unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the killing of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for murder, said the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the battle.
The police found the glasses on the site and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS' subsidiary WAFB.
After interrogation with Simpson, the police said he admitted he shot Wayde to death.
His bail was fixed at $350.000, according to Advocate.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shot wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police's escaping force, the police's state law lab, the Southern University police and the residents of the area for help with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU's athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "fulty and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 meters long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "chocked" by Waydes' death.
"You're worried about this all the time," said Wade.
Vulcan spies ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned in Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and the registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The Centre discovered several mules and tremors.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted increased activity in the volcano which stands 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 affected central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police collaborate with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent demonstrators were interfering with the Crown Police while thousands participated in rival protests to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonia polarising vote on concession.
A group of masked separatists held back by the crooked police threw eggs and colour powders on them, resulting in dark dust oils on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Fights also broke out later during the day, and police used their batons to stop them.
For hours the independence groups shouted "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists shouted "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage caused by the protests, according to local pressure.
The atmosphere is still tense in the region, which longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was honoured by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but participation was low when most who opposed the secrecy voted.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people in violent conflicts were injured last year when the police tried to stop the vote at the polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but had to take another route.
Electrician Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
Last year, we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are for independence have had difficulty keeping the driving force up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-exile or are in custody waiting for trial about their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest to support the police on his cell phone, said that the conflict had been fired on by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he intends to candidate in the election of the European Parliament next year.
"Candidate to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the underwriting experience we have experienced from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the car drives into house
Three men — 33, 34 and 39 — have been arrested after driving a car into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
A armbow may have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 to Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the profit
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss on 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side still hasn't got a missing win in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes the European League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his profit stretch to six matches – the main coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against across visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored; their straightforwardness gave Rangers all possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could just shoot wide after sliding in to measure Craig Halkett's nickage across the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a freespark and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, making goals from the middle of the target area.
In that situation Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was unthrimmed and the target Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's target guard Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's definite game.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston's target area and were handled without problems. Two penalties – after Halkett's challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were rejected.
"Penomenaal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenaal display and results for Livingston.
Each one of them is outstanding and continues to exceed the expectations on the road upward.
Their gaming style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillful organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in full line through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments during Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not keep track — they only opened the homepage once — and it is some of a wake-up watch for Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday smiled and blue sky (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They have become unfair about human rights, freedom of printing and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many adherents gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrants – many of them Kurdish – also heard their voices and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duelling protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero of certain German Turks and is condemned as an unwarranted ruler of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in crash with car
A cyclist has died in a crash with a car in London.
The crash took place near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-run road in Deptford in southeast London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and medical officers were called there, but the man died on the site.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a smiting accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crash in Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked and buses have been redirected and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in trouble at a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The worries broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and still in progress.
Specialized "tornedovacts" have been called there to deal with the worries, which involve eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on site for minor face damage.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those who are behind this will be attributed to the police and can get an increased prison penalty."
HMP Long Lartin accommodates over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the Crown Police were called to the prison to deal with serious wrecks where personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (areas with drought can benefit)
It is rare for tropical low pressure to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week when hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the desert of the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in the west Arizona and into south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "thio tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of Arizona's border."
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm rain, with isolated quantities of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 2.5 to 5 cm of rain at risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be useful because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor suffers just over 40 percent of Arizona of at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
The hurricane Rosa will first travel over the peninsula Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane force in Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific Sea, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach the land mass of Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico may have heavy rain, which represents a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5–15 cm rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north of Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert of the southwestern United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and clay flows in the desert, as well as earthfalls in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for murder attempts
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested suspected for murder attempts after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST in Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stabilised".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old man was arrested during the night in Radstock, said the Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking everyone who may have filmed what happened to the cell phone to appear.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, badness, anger" from the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the disrespectfulness and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said to his followers in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "been suffering from the badness, anger" of the democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually abused her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before the Congress on his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the forthcoming midterm elections.
"We are five weeks from one of our most important choices.
I'm not running, but I'm running," he said.
"That's why I go around and fight for supreme candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to "resist and prevent".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number rising
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed against the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities of Saturday.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu in Friday when up to six meters of waves crashed at the beach in the sky and swept many out to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami alert came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victim to the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Disaster Agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone but dragged cars, stocks and houses with it. It affected everything in its way," said Nugroho. He also said that the tsunami had travelled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the hit coastline.
Some climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Airplanes released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and stores are destroyed, bridges are distorted and collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The line of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT stated in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times as large as the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the Agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found during the sudden collapse of buildings, he said, and 540 persons were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damages may be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is nearer the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
"There are over 300.000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The Agency was criticized last Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had attacked Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor in a building shouts frenetic warnings about the tsunami to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes a wall of water crashes towards the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami led to an extensive power interruption that interrupted all communication around Palu, which made the rescue work difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun to send cargo flights with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated persons are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for the aid work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from World Vision in Donggala have come to Palu where they seek protection during bureaucracy on the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the road, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Assistance groups have begun the biased assistance work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may only be used if an exemption permit is announced after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can release international assistance, but that status has not yet been announced."
When the second night fell in Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, family and friends of missing people still hoped that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that illuminate dark natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue workers saved a woman who had been trapped for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian National Monitoring Force Coach, had trained two of the missing screen pilots in front of Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mondayi, were his students.
"As a screen flight veteran, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the hours after the screen pilots heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only got a grey bock, instead of two blue.
"I think that means that the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26 750 during cash filling at Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26.750 from a Brink's co-worker who filled a bankroom at Newport on the Leveee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied a bank space in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, "a different man jumped up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
The Witnesses saw several suspects flee the site, according to the press release, but the police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the perpetrators shall contact the Newport police of 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper is changing name to Ye
Rapperen Kanye West is re-named - to Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The creature that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of its eighth album, released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, which was posted for "feelful reasons" according to the program's creators.
Ye is a shortening of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio values Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, all.
The album is like a mirror of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, previously co-operated with West, has previously written his name with and without bindelines and versals.
Mexican AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians.
Mexican recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students is approaching.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza last Saturday "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Armies fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2nd 1968 and killed up to 600 people during a era when left-hand student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education attract young people to criminal gangs.
USA should double AI financing
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the US government have made statements about AI, despite the fact that the United States does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough within AI," Lee said.
A double-larged budget can double the chance that the next major AI breakthrough is made in the United States, Lee said to the CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest ranked American Othello player, and later he was in the leadership of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google China department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what next would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work at AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with the AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students within AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants funds to persons at academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distributing money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonia's referendum on the change of names
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "The North Macedonia", which would solve a several decades old dispute with Greece which has prevented the country's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north is a requirement in its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of names would undermine the identity of the Macedonian majority.
President Görge Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a bojkott campaign has led to doubts as to whether the minimum participation of 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid will be reached.
The question of the electoral bill in the referendum is: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the supporters of the name-by-name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth changing the name if it makes it possible for Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia split, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the result in order to make it decisive.
The change in name requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13 o'clock.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the Macedonian referring to the country's change of name, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Outside the House in Skopje organized Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small stage and place out chairs in front of the tents set up by those who boichots the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneak in through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO would lead to needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because more than 80% of our inhabitants are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said a "Yes" result would be a confirmation of our future.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Policy Survey, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters were voting in the referendum, which falls within the required minimum participation.
According to another survey carried out by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of participants were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of them were going to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be counted, 50% of registered voters plus one vote must be voted.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious relapse for the policy of the western government since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero gets through the entire Brighton's defense to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's profit of 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England in Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculous when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine strikeer got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out in the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around a defender and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling on the left.
The English forwarder used his first kick in the target area to give the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's target guard Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover of the Premier League game.
Target arrived in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's revir on that game.
He sent off a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the remote pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the online moment before it ended up out of reach.

Scherzer wants to play against Rockies.
Nationals have been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which lies a match ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still have a chance for the final game.
Rockies got a wild card-place with a winning of 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, but is still looking for their first division title.
"We play about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at the higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not announced their start for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they are bent against letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who was going to make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and was going to throw on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's right-handed casters are 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation of Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of the votes of Republicans in the forthcoming midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks from one of our most important choices.
This is one of the big, big... I don't run, but I candid. That's why I'm going around and fighting for the supreme candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They're determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their badness, horror.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control, that's what they want, power and control.
Democrats, he said, fight to "resist and prevent."
"You have seen that in the last four days," he said and called the Democrats "arge and evil and horrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met by high-bowing from the spectators.
"Do you remember what she said?
'Did you leak the document?'
"Eh, eh, eh, eh?
No, no, no, I'm expecting a ...'It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a wide church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for censure, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of MPs from Labour who hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way when she resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized not to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically enough similar topics for which Jeremy criticized former leaders.
The communication on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour last Friday said that "we want the meetings to be welcome and productive".
For most of my eight years as the Labour local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But unfortunately many meetings are not, and the promise of "friendly, merciless" policies has been forgotten long ago, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly obvious that deviations are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the leaders of the Party accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues who I thought had a similar political view that I expected to make a complete conversion and take positions that I would otherwise have never agreed to – whether it was the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it really doesn't matter what I say – it follows a tire of unrest on social media that demands that I be disposed of, criticizes my own policy and says that I should not even be part of Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
The fact is that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments in this era's policies is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour is to promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this wide church, and with every disbelief and change in the selection rules, the party becomes increasingly narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the past two years about flying under the radar and not being too straightforward, so "organizing."
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a schooler 32 years ago, provoked by the lack of thatcher's government, which literally caused my primary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as Minister of Government.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the latest elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused by my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To those of you who promoted the request last Friday, I would just like to say that when the country goes towards a Brexit that will harm households, activities and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat to dispose of me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Lost Ayr on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this lovely entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now on top, the only unshaped side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the profit, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested during our games so far and are still unworked, so we're of course happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland Captain Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the match, let Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconversioned attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a punishment, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half of the game and Patrick Anderson's attempts, converted by Baggot, reduced the leadership to five points.
There was then a long wait for a serious damage to Ruaridh Knott, carried by the plan, and after the restart Ayr increased the management again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting Captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconversioned attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of great pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the punishment-line-out behind Ayr's maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent away Gregor Henry's flank for the home team's fifth attempt.

Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been appointed CEO for a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays along with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
Duon has announced that the next nineth season will be the last series, and Kiernan seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "blooming restaurant industry".
"The sea belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the court opens the way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol a rigged headquarters for the Navy of La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The bases of the Navy from Titicaca Lake to Amazona carry the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s is still strong – and it is also the desire to sail again in the Pacific.
This hope is higher than for decades now when Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, an atmosphere of unity and peace, and obviously awaits the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will judge in favour of Bolivia's demands that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, has to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them their own discharge to the sea.
Monday's decision also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia's karismatic native president, who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court judges for the benefit of Bolivia, and that not much would change even if it did.
The United Nations Court, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to award the Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have been more harmful than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She claims that Morale’s aggressive rhetoric has tainted Chile’s remaining charity.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to start a new era for relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crinkle.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he said.
"The conclusion is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the nation will not destroy its nuclear weapons only if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be at the border to solve the death status of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "desire" to continue sanctions and the United States' protests against a statement to end the Korean war will ever tame North Korea.
Washington is hesitant to agree to the statement without Pyongyang initiating significant nuclear disarmament first.
Both Kim and the United States President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against the fact that Pyongyang is really going to get rid of a weapon arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line huge headbones on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of crazy, oversized headbones for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blinded the style icons at the Paris fashion week.
Unbelievable impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent away their eyelashing creatures on the catwalk.
Valentino’s primary creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like broad hat that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry watermelons, a wizard hat, and even a pineapple — but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had merged lips and rather like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a wet suit of snorkel and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass rod.
And if you continue your enormous courage, you're lucky.
Mode experts predict that the huge herds may be on their way to shops near you.
The oversized hats will come shortly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a brake of 60 cm that has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathing suit that was in it.
The raffia bag in terracotta, with raffiafrans and a white leather handle, was excellent in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris fashion week.
Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer – the designer has had such an impact that it would be hard to ignore demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills decisive for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other social entanglements.
With up to 30 000 students in Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools endeavour to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement adapted curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and demanded topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we can not only rely on English when creating relationships and confidence with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with a maximum number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 members’ schools showed that 72 percent of students who studied mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages as topical elections are now considered as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics at learning levels in independent schools and beyond.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills 2014 concluded that employers had difficulties for various reasons in filling their vacancies, by 17 per cent, attributed to a lack of language skills.
With this said, language skills become increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring linguistic skills, these skills will be necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries, automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a study of more than 4,000 adult British published by YouGov 2013, 75 per cent responded that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that total came up in a two-digit percentage (15 per cent).
Therefore it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find a meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK before 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scotish independent schools strive to provide a teaching environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future has.
In a global economic environment, it is without doubt language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
Il faut the bee le faire.
John Edward is Head of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron does Lakersdebut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James make the debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Laker's reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games in this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign events, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned events next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In pending a confirmatory vote of its candidate for the High Court's vacant post, Trump aims to build up support for future middle-year elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control over the Congress before the incoming elections in November.
What time is Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely deal with this week's questioning of the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense after accusation of his sexual abuse, with a expected delay in the vote from the Senate in up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their feet before November elections.
President Trump thus said that these five conventions next week are aimed at "associating volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the Reuters" according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that did not want to be named Reuters.
The night's events, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate Candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been following in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come there to try to give him an increase in the polls," says Simon Haeder, a state vet at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is struggling to keep the hopes alive for Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, the contests on Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
Moment's turning pendulum is a fully invented sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before competitors like these.
So what momentum is it now?
"They had a six-point line and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, the advance of four points with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in the sails, but they have much to encourage, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and commuted home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and precedes with good example.
The winestrobe bald than higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive pillow to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had been after with two after two games.
His pillow that won them the match of 15 met with a similar wraith, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match," said Spieth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's unquestionable story.
Europe's odd but delightful couples are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and audience reactions state that they are the players to hit on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to speak of European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fireball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spanish and the Swede into a hole that they never even got near to climb out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursome are so fascinating to look close because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead for the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a struggle glowing that some, especially on the side of the United States, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage at Ryder Cup's last day after coming out of Saturday's fireball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 line over the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victorys over a encamped Tiger Woods and commuted home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, who struggled to keep the pokal that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really started during the morning fireball with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in foursomen and won two games, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the pokal.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend is just the second couple to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fireball, they hit an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who fought through two games on Saturday, showed some moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fireball and foursome, and of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning fireball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe did not have wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
The three-fold winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fireball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team come back from a low position of four points in the single matches, however, Furyks side only needs a scored result to keep the pokal.
After being the second best for two days it looks like a motattack on Sunday may be difficult to get through.
North Korea says that the "never" will disarm unilaterally without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust to the United States and it was not possible that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that in the last year North Korea had taken "measures to show its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear tests installations and promising not to spread nuclear and nuclear technology.
"We do not see, however, any equivalent response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we unilaterally unarmed ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a approach divided into stages of the nuclear power that would lead to the reward of North Korea as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, because it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution entirely as Pyongyang had done earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards "the decommissioning of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean war 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first decommission its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused negotiations on relieving severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "decommissioning first" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose by force and even objects to the "declaration of ending the war," says Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can get us on our knees is a dream for the people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the United States leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier during the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament had been South Korea and not the United States, the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear disarmament would not have reached such a deadlock."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the United States mainland with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "destruct" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take action to disarmament, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timeframe for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US State Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The maintenance of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without failing until we realise a complete, definitive, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to choke the funding of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later for setting "walker like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile plant and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moving towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "dygies".
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading university are often unaware of the very foundations for how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first in his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effect of sleep shortages on learning.
At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the weight of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students had severe sleep shortages during the week.
The timing course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In some of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep shortages and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, the participants are told how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "dy" still exists, he says and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep shortages were a growing problem.
Making sure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because sleeplessness puts the brain in a starvation state and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus across course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before starting their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can cause you to turn around in the day, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's target lowers Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 down in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking to take home its first victory on the road since February 4-1-triumf at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership Leader Harts.
Menga hit to seven minutes before half-time and Rangers never managed to even out the result.
While Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and lies just behind Hibernian on the target distinction.
And there may be more problems on the ground for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the outer end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinal of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-killed game overwhelmed the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
There should have been targets already two minutes into the game when Mengas first pass released Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle fieldman missed his big chance and shot outside.
A frispark on the depth of Keaghan Jacobs then reached the team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back pole.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their games during the last third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waving away the Colombian's call.
Rangers managed to make only two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis opening shots in the 34th minute may go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their kneeling deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's stable situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher suited Scott Robinson, who stayed calm and chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the prey gave almost immediate effect when the outsider hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett that swept up long fit after long fit.
Holt's side could have strengthened his leadership in the last stage, but McGregor managed to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nicked outside after the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late demand for punishment when he was tamed with Jacobs, but again looked Thomson away.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's calendar: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a invention that eventually led to the manic called Geiger meter.
Geiger meters have become a foundation for science since then and are also large in pop culture, as well as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado", with the main role of the seemingly unlikely cowpoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given by the radioactivity of the minerals. "Evans:
Evans, "Yes, it pops now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method means extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injection
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injection the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and thick intestinal cancer," Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by carrying a MAGA ship, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was bowed out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swimling performance where he praised the United States President Donald Trump and said that he himself would run for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great, he ragged against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood Star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate's Legal Committee on the charges of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the playback of West's release was uploaded on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mess with West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headbone.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I've fallen low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Would you also want to sink low?" and said that he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what I can do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Test with love."
His comments at least twice attracted more burops from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, reported Variety. One person said: "It became deadly silent in the studio."
West had come in as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with their appearance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the brave souls: THAT YOU STOD ON YOU TO THE MOBB."
But the host of the chat show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "each one itself and it's completely wonderful."
"But I didn't choose to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his " art" which I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
So are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, even known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparkollegan, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Judgments for murder attempts after stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of murder attempts after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to be at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington beats toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its sword-wing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his actor in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even 31, admitted that he feels "smart strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is born and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, making young boys feel that they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it is really one of the major issues of our time - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not do any Game of Thrones follow-ups when the series comes to an end next summer and says he's "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so that's how it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, which Kit's character Jon Snow loves, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family ownership in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says the health authorities.
Approximately 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transferred through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an acute issue in China's HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBTs is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will sooner or later marry women.
Many cases of infection are due to insufficient protection of intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked the GOP Senator's tasks, covers "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the US Congressman Maxine Waters condemned allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these allegations were spread by right-hand extremist websites.
"Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information contained home addresses and phone numbers to Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came up online Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of a Senate Panel on the accusations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of Water's staff, reported Hill.
"This unrounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security has been jeopardised by these fraudulent and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unrounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement was quickly criticized online, including from the former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she has no temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they must not be angry.
They can't be defiant.
They must not question the motive of the questioner.
They must be calm and sensible."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of appearing to be angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who candid to dispose of Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big if true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and crime-fighting beings for these fraudulent requirements.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parodi by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit services in each new film with British slope, and the same seems to be true for this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedy - a series of spy parodies that were kicked in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will vass satir about how clearly bad we are to become the nation's new export product?
In any case, it's the incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face got its license to mess up to sake renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he's a broad comic creation intended for biopublic even in non-English-talking countries
Of course, he's the crazy secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a nutty Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the OS in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There's one or two nice moments in the latest JE film
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor leaves for a short time hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is displayed, but the humor feels quite low and strangely overflowing, especially because the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humour feels like it's suitable for children instead of adults and for me, Johnny English is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film bravads in the role of Bean.
The topic is now the fact that the United Kingdom is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super secret web network of spys, which reveals the identity of all UK agents in the field, to the agent in the great dissatisfaction of service - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and hard-worked figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence counselor informs her that when each active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the stemming Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in some well-privileged institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art to work undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with its former long-lived assistant Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hockey-stick-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to being discarded.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so horribly wrong with Her Majesty's Secret Service and encountering Olga Kurylenco's beautiful five-dead Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the karismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve the UK computer problem: the unhappy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssé of pears-like traits: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on the Volta luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to acquaint themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but although the film is both charming and speedy, it has an air of children TV around it.
Pretty moderately everything.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I can't stop thinking: Can't the British movie industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour refuses to draw up a plan for British to work a four-day week but to receive salary for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Party Labour is considering a radical plan that is that the British work for a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
The party, according to the task of business managers, wants to transfer savings made through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda for the workers.
Changing to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic changes.
A representative higher up in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits in the party's position to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, including the Greens Party who promised a four-day week of work during its election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A spokesman for Labour said: "A four-day week of work is not the policy of the party and that is nothing the party agrees on."
Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "faceless leaders" and "sniffers" of state companies.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of aquatic companies cannot regain all their efforts, as a Labour government can make "deductions" because of what they perceive have been wrong acts.
He also confirmed plans to put workers in business boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10% of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, which then stands for annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell in the TV program "60 minutes" about whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could cause some Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to their change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the claim came out, and I said, "Have you done it?"
He was firm, convinced, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems unshakable.
"I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite tank," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names could not verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormous impressive array of stars that appear and an equally impressive mission; to fight world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people roaming to Central Park's Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival is, according to a 2012 statement, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pre-language group that hopes to combat poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteer work, email a world leader, ring or other meaningful ways to increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that they make real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen reports that more than 19 million "actions" have been registered from its followers who have fought for a variety of goals.
It says that these measures have contributed to encouraging world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and notices arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The Group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors involved in "helping children to develop to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to contribute to combating malnutrition in the area after having received more than 4.700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as malnutrition as a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the Tracey Ullman partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken requiring the United Kingdom to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes dietary programmes targeting 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on its website: "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Replied Global citizens: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at the event of the year in New York, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicates the Interior Minister
The government can "at need" intervene its fleet to prevent Russian energy actors from joining the markets, including in the Middle East, the U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an impetus to explore new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, Europe's southern parts," he said.
And according to him there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the sea roads are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blockade, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group called "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to managing Russia and Iran, and noted that they really are the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and exchange fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day-winning" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Pronunciations come after the Trump administration's aim is to increase exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump administration, including the United States President Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the Moscow "capture".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American position was relapsed by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly disapprove of a third party disrupting our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinate thinker" if she's going to make a presidential election in 2020," says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would take a "ordinate thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the U.S. middle-year election.
During a Council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman on top," said the Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a good think of running into the presidential post."
Warren weighed into President Donald Trump during the Council House meeting and said that "he took this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply worried about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been free-tuning in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "we obviously need a FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe that she would be candidates for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "faithful" Massachusetts choosers said that the Senator should not candidate, according to a study carried out by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidateship.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of the former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% for a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Deputy President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through now when he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience in PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other veterans that "they come back as other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence against a woman, attempting to prevent a report on domestic violence and arms possession in drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, and the District of Columbia support the question of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support a legal trial aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who escape gang-related violence or violence in their homes.
Representatives from the 18 states and district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
Full name of the defendant in the Grace case v. sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy have not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang members" beat her, but American officials refused her asylum application on 20 July.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems of gangs and violence at home.
The new US asylum policy amended a decision by the Immigration Authorities from 2014 allowing illegal immigrants to seek asylum in order to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed based on specific facts and circumstances applicable to the claim, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the friend-of-the court report.
Advocates further argued in the report that the policy that denies immigrant entry damages the US economy, and argues that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "leverage the necessary labour force".
In June, the Minister of Justice, Jeff Sessions, ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", said Sessions when the policy was announced on June 11.
Asyl was never meant to alleviate all the problems - including all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death figure doubles in the pursuit of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was all sadder.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her febrig boy in a evacuation center in Palu.
"The ambulance picks up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a deficiency."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rotting through water damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals injured in the earthquake of 7.5 were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who were affected by a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because of continued strong post-quakes.
With teary eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shaked the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We couldn't escape.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a quadrilateral ad in an American newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador accused China that Beijing used the American press to spread propaganda.
The US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying a supplement in Des Moines Register - the state Iowa's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the US 6th Congress elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to intervene in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters where is a new phase of an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Peking and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with elevated tariffs on each other's imports.
China's repatriation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa who support the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador in China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
China, wrote Branstad in a debate article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "double the bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The government of China uses America's dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper skiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of deviating voices and will not see any true reflection of the various views that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economy, because the media are ruled by iron hand by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most outstanding newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare off female electorate for the mid-year election through Kavanaugh fiaskot, warns analytics
Since many top republics defend the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh who faces several charges of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a relapse, especially from women, during the coming elections.
The emotions about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, says that it cannot be turned back to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) the last attempt for a FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the newspaper Washington, DC.
On Friday morning they scanned the demonstration "November coming!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans who control the court committee chose to move on with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go on the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among yet undetermined female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Already before Ford's public testimony with charges of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a relapse could follow if the Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the Committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh comes through, it is also about how Republicans have dealt with this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities USA, a group helping democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in the coldening of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion survey from YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during their witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims that Ford has made, as did those from at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford witnessed to the Senate Court Committee last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court exposed her sex organs while participating in a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology doctor's latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people get access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to do-lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "Personal Authorisation through Data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some program developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer cods.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on the high edge overnight.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has in recent months been an influential vote in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Priest rewarded with Viktoria Cross during World War I
The only priest in the Church of England who was rewarded with a Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his action during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a shooter four days later and never found out that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A memorial stone was detected by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brily symbolic", that the stone would be exposed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the prize.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Col Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the shooting line and led with "great bravery" line forward before he alone decided the fight.
Lieutenant Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble to."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead saw Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've been staying up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose included 13 matches, including six on the main card and was displayed live at night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were little impressed after staying awake to the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a subscribed child program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to change to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's Deputy Director for Marketing and Communication when asked about the broadcast.
"Greet pig, yes"
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution to the reprise," said Coker.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this to Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But in fact, it was a state question.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of sex - as we normally do. We took ourselves water over the head in our efforts to satisfy the fans.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "below" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt less than his companions during his upbringing because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke of homosexuals' rights to give others "hop".
He also said that he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular program manager, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of disease.
During his one-off performance on Laverne's first programme, Daley tells how he felt "less worth" than others during his growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worthless and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic Bronze Medal has become a high-profile advocate of HBT rights and used its prominence at the Commonwealth Games of the year in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the word because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-fold world champion said that his in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "come as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar Woman last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympics as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was only about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic Gold Medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after diagnosing brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had their tickets to the Olympic Games in London in 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't say to him: you won't be able to sit on the front row Daddy" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was not until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the OS 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of an Olympic audience, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - a song that had followed him to the OS and which still gave him shivers.
Desert Island Discs will be sent to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will hit the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was bent by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four balls and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting cheerleave and practicing his game in hope of having a chance to show up his ability.
He has never been the shavest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in the shape of the tough banana at Le Golf National, where the long ruffle often penalizes hardly.
It is not only the banana that discourages, in the 9th match on Sunday Mickelson meets the champion Francesco Molinari, who along with the novel Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below in front of the 12 single matches, have wind at the start, Mickelsons' match can be absolutely crucial.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a clapp on my back, and laid his arm around me, and said that he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"There's nothing wrong with his self-confidence.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these laws during previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd do more, but now it's what it is and we'll have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Fallo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, but Furyk said that his presence brought other qualities of the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's quick, he likes to joke with people, and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was nice to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be just a memory.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day's singles in Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under the leadership of Seve Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but finally won with the least possible margin with the result 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds you that we led great at Valderrama, we led great at Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with distress and scarce," said Bjorn (on photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and leads with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give everything.
Going out and doing everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this pokal and that is where our focus is.
I've said it all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're well aware of what's waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was satisfied with the performance of his players on a tough golf course and added: "I would never be able to do this myself.
Tomorrow's new challenges are awaiting.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that apply and it is a completely different thing.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it's okay, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golfer is fully tested.
It is the message that you need to convey to the players, to get out the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also go and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Björn, the opponent Jim Fury will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who camed home three points out of four.
Furuty himself has been on both sides of great conversions during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to go out as fast as on Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the pace starts one way, there is a lot of pressure on these intermediate matches.
We made our stand and placed the guys we wanted to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the fight and meet Rory McIlroy at the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," said Bjorn about his single choices.
Germany’s new warships are being postponed
The newest fregate of the German fleet would have been sealed in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be sealed until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the jointship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg freegates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet as early as 2014, but the problems arising after delivery were fatal for the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen fregates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of air protection and sea target missiles, as well as some smuggling techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest fregates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are put into operation, writes Die Zeit.
The fateful F125-fregate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A bit known about the causes of the return, but the German media indicated a number of important "software and hardware errors" which made the warship useless if it was used for a battle mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older fregates in the Bremen class.
It also showed that the ship has a significant overweight, which leads to impaired performance and restricts the marine's ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7 000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the entire project's price cap - including the training of the crew - becomes a problem.
It is said to have been devastating EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the start-up stage.
Problems affecting the latest fregates become particularly important in the light of the recent warnings that Germany's sea power is reducing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet is actually "starting to have a lack of fully equipped vessels".
The official said that there is a growing problem, since old ships are dismantled but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the fregates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust thiefs to the secret life of the bat
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunting for food.
We hope that the results will throw new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help control future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at National Trust for Scotland, will follow the South and Dwarf Pipistrell as well as brown borrowed and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sound and the species that do what.
A environment map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS naturcare counselor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of life are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of environmental management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Fladder mice populations in Scotland and in the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects living environments.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and hut tax attacks.
In fact, fladder mice aren't blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, examine nests and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home for eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here on Threave we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a variety of favourable habitats.
But there is much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand more about what they need to enjoy.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance in properties, because it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly wipe out a whole population.
Fladder mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations feel."
Ronaldo rejects rape while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him for "false news" and says that people "will market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal's and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) defeated the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the requirements were reported.
"No no no no no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good," said the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for claims, which they have called "an unauthorized report of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount equivalent to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her analt, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was "99%" a "good guy" betrayed by the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed on a conciliation because she felt "fear of retaliation" and was worried about being "degraded publicly".
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if you lost your position as world leader in car production after Brexit, Mr Clark said.
He added that it was "anxiety" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement they will temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, President of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main problems concern what car manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is operated on the "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, it may lead to disturbances at the border that the industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day in stock on its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and therefore production would be forced to stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best agreement that allows, as I say, not just success to be appreciated at the moment, but for us to take this opportunity." he said to BBC Radio 4:s programme Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must definitely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite Company at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
A government official said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could "shoot in another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacles to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardising Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying the listening equipment to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility of dismissing the president through the 25th addition of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he was going to depart.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, which will be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee interrogation where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been set, it may happen this week, or a delay by a week, taking into account all other things that happen at the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would challenge that claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The values Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disapproval of television reporters who "play for the gallery", although she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds more questions than any president before him," she said and added without quoting evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, perhaps the president showed why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances to the composite reporters.
Mr Hälsos Minister writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in the NHS of Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to remain after Brexit.
Mr Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of decommitted status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit have continued, before decisions expected to come this autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparation for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to repeat how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Collegs from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after having had a headache
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury in Saturday's loss with 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennesseans Mike Organ.
Tennessee States main coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage happened just before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a cargo was taken out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the hospital Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/scope of the injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which gave him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK, and the additional money is used to help homeless, according to the Tory Party’s new plans
The measure shall neutralise Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The UK Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be allowed to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The additional money will be used to help homeless, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be regarded as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of dwellings with more affordable prices and aiming to high-income employees.
The increase in stamp tax will be taken out of individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a ride to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is in excess of the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on leisure dwellings and housing purchased to rent out. It may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will withdraw up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK, which drives up prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot into the housing market.
Many wealthy areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new play will only be a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on housing with affordable prices to solve the UK's "depressive housing situation".
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a spectacular range of suggestions for housing reforms, including rent roofs and an end to voyages without the tenant's chill.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunity to build new housing.
Theresa May says: "I said last year that I would spend my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means resolving the problems on the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build up a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and even for companies based abroad, to buy housing as hard-working residents in our country.
The dream of owning a dwelling for too many people has just become a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland."
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to ever become Scotland coach.
The 42-year-old shots look forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from northeast England, currently located on the third place in the League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light last summer after leading St. Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B country team and that's all," Ross says to BBC Scotlands Sportsound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland on Hampden with my father, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I succeed in leading a club."
Among Ross' representatives as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about following such established names in such a large club. He has previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this moment, I judge success based on the answer to the question, 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club certainly belongs to the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a trainer for three years, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month sailor as a member of Heart's coach team.
Then he helped Alloa come back from the transfer to the third division, and lifted St. Mirren from being close to the transfer to be the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a crossroads," he remembers and refers to when he took the command of Alloa.
"I really thought that leadership was entirely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had fine results and could live decently on it. Besides, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot to get through every week.
It's still stress and pressure on the job for me, but training feels quite right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I do. I feel better than I've ever done all my adult life."

A study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer’s heat wave has brought increased revenue for the country’s fighting pubs, but the restaurant chains have gained greater pressure.
The figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but the revenue of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from the CGA company, who has compiled the figures, said: "Continuing beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs rose by 2.8%. However, the restaurants got even more difficult.
The reduction in turnover of restaurants by 1.8% in June was only worse in July.
Pubars and bars that especially offer beverages showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had risen more than the restaurants had dropped.
Pubar offering food was also difficult in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
The decision on managing pubs and bars rose by 6.6% that month, and food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman in the service and entertainment industry RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports events are still the main factors for the sale of large kitchens.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a reduction in sales of 4.8% per year is particularly difficult to cope with in addition to current cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come more inappropriate for companies operated by food sales. Time may show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give a well-necessary residual."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now launched.
The trade sales supervisor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub bar and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyzes data on the situation of 47 active groups with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
A study shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years of age, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A study of 20 000 students in high school and high school shows an increase in the number of false Instagram pages
The result has increased concern that sexual content is put up there.
20% of the students reported that they had a "main account" which they showed their parents
One of five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they keep secret to adults.
A study of 20 000 students in high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta accounts", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has sprinkled anxiety because sexual content is posted there.
20% of the students reported that they have a cleaned "main account" that they can show their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled on her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager who urged others to " rape me."
According to the study, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of the children between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The Chairman of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to create places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" of the Board of the Scottish Liberty Association, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most praised athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her wider experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from her becoming a member of the board", says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the OS in Atlanta 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now expert commentator at BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time was allowed to show if I was to recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I've recovered completely, learned to go again and now I'm doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with cows share the internet
A company selling breast pumps has caused differences on the Internet with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers with choirs being milked.
To pay attention to the launch of what is said to be "the first quiet breast pump of the world" the consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired advertising film with humor to show what freedom the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real mothers dance in a choir full of choirs for a song of lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't know it, this is not a jewel, but a boob."
The reflection continues: "Push out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused conflict on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has encountered mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it sheds light on the dairy industry's "phases".
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their kids are taken away from them just a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comment: "It is understood that it is traumatic for both mother and children.
But certainly, why not use them to make advertising for a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another one adds: "What a real-favoured advertising movie."
Others defend the movie, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
"I think this is brilliant.
I'd have gotten one if I was still breast-feeding.
pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The advertising movie's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," someone writes.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertising movie that turns to mothers pumping (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like 'coats'."
This is not a movie that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discrete pump stuffed in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women pumping milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be carried discreetly in a breast-feeding chest, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk cows, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while in an entertaining and recognizable way showing the incredible sense of freedom of the new pump.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London's fashion week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk with clothes of the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the border of Texas
The number of detained migrant children has been shooting up, even though the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged. This is partly because heavily rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the government of Trump have made it more difficult to place children with reference persons.
In the past, most references themselves have been paperless immigrants, and fear to put their own chances of staying in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential references and other adult members of the household would have to leave fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Authority, testified to the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for references to single minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities since earlier.
"Nearly 80% of those who are either reference persons or members of the family of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," said Albence.
In order to deal more quickly with the children's cases, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be held in court within one month of their detention rather than after 60 days, as previously practice, according to staff at the premises.
Many of them are present on video link rather than personally in order to bring their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to be entitled to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to staff at the camps and reports from the system in recent months.
Professionals say that anxieties rise at major facilities such as Tornillo, where evidence that a child is more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the Tent City without having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and say goodbye to friends can worsen the traumas many already struggle with.
Syria demands that American, French and Turkish "ocupation forces" withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Mr Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Damascus government would continue to "fight this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, which primarily trains and advises both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war - devastated country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" which enable refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're coping something that should be a pure humanitarian matter."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomas say that a new agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel mount Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political conversations.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement cut off a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, with three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "the clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusrafront, which "will be wiped out".
The UN messenger Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition, to make a draft postwar constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Mr Moualem provided conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the group's work would be limited to "review of the articles of the present Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic Donald Trump would win the re-election in 2020 unless his presidentship is prematurely terminated by national law and scandal, as many liberal viewers are likely hoping for.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of a presidentship ever!"
At present, there is no evidence that the viewers have become tired.
Since 2014, the viewing figures in the best broadcasting time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcasting time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. The MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has toped the lists of cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news evenings.
"This is like a fire that people are attracted to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitolium.

In the chaos there's a entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, Washington's report can determine the future of the case of abortion, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the prosperity of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it is possible to be an informed citizen when you have suddenly been sitting and watching for six hours on an expert panel that debates Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to your book "Fear", Paul Manafort's struts jacket for 15 000 dollars ("a plaque filled with hybris", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macaw descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A part of what he does makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creators of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump follow-up roll crew and daily intrigues (smooth arguments with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).

When I spoke to the TV producer Mr Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and owled indoors and watched MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He couldn't wear himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be put before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the cave.
"I remember when we made all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from streams into the smoothest race ever before the middle-year election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congress District receives a lot of money. It is thanks to the restructuring of a Congress District that has made two Members now compete about the same place.
This recently redesigned suburbs district in Pittsburg is represented by the Democrat Conor Lamb, who took place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, the Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were rewritten after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were constitutionally changed for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign financing dispute between the economic sections of the largest parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a scarce gain in a widely watched special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain precedent.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for China aid but then backed up
Diplomas noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with a little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the parties rejected the Trump organisation's leader team.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "new decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", said the Ministry's spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, an estimated 140 million dollars in American aid in 2017. Money would, among other things, go to drug control and development and constitute financial support.
The sanctions proposed, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have struck the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings continued, American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October. It is a sign of the importance of the presidential administration's view of the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
One speaker for Mr Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three US officials, two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next inevitable step could be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on the alleged abuse of Donald Trump in a legal case, which is now evident in public registers.
Mueller is also reported to direct his investigation against whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the Congress changed the majority, Trump will be held accountable to that congregation just when he prepares to vote again, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, so neither will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how extended the fight can be.
In 1938 German officers were ready to stage a state coup against Hitler, if only the western countries had stood against him and stood behind the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
History is about such decisive events, and the relentless progress of democracy is either speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein the man who controls what will happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he should have proposed to record the president secretly, and speculated that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not correct.
"How shall we answer if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he may enter the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we in the middle of the elections vote on a Congress that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I do not think we will fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador residence.
She survived, migrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me away to light the Sabbath lights on the table decorated with the hacker.
With that as an inheritance, how could I be other than optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Vilarreal that ended even earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
One knee damage prevented the middle fielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 match against Vilarreal. But he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard against greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game in the belief that we could get something, and went away with a point.
Perhaps we could have got it in at the end, but in the large part it was a fair result.
I think they were better at the first half of the game, and we came back in the second half and we were better teams.
Now on Thursday it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it'll be a tough game. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can probably pull forward and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troops are good and the guys are having fun, the training's good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, add the last season behind us and succeed well."
Women sleep badly because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the investigation had a clear picture of how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked to their family members about it.
Approximately half the people who participated in the country - wide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Deputy Chairman of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you start.
Talk to your husband/make and your children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not talk about how you want to have it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may have a significant impact on the costs.
Take help from your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover the costs, or a self-insurance with own resources, if you can afford.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts from the beginning.
Create a nursing authority so that you can appoint a trusted person who will review your medical care and ensure that your healthcare professionals follow your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a warrant for your economy.
Then you choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are incapable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an ageing parent who is in an emergency medical condition and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergy?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
"It is not only the economy that is at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medication is that?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is ready."
Fired several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
One man was shot several times with air rifles when he walked home from an outdoor night.
The victim, who is 40 years old, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "single event".
The victim didn't see his assailant.
The injuries are not life - threatening, and the police urge witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday.
The communications are devastated, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain information from the Donggala management area, an area north of Palu near the epicenter of the earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami hit.
Donggala is a management area extending more than 300 km of the northwestern Sulawesis coast.
The management area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299 200 people in 2017.
The pillars of the Central Sulawesis province are fishing and agriculture, in particular for the Donggala coastal region.
Nickelgruvdrift is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunami several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian Emergency Management Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, too, a tsunami that killed nine people affected western Donggala.
Indonesia is located in the circumpacifish seismic firering, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake at the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh province on the North Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with the magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, the most popular island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that struck across the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with the magnitude of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the Province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 struck one of Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and about 300 people killed.
2016: A basic earthquake affected the management area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Great earthquakes affected the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and Vice President Candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested suspected of domestic violence, for having taken up a complaint of domestic violence and for having opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska state police.
According to the police report, he's supposed to have taken the phone from a woman acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su jail and is held against the 500-dollar bail that will be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the bail, according to the KTUU TV channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to give up his attitude, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious crimes under Class A, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to one year and $250.000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious crimes under Class B, which is punished by one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time Palin's been accused of crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being dealt with by the Alaska veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of being involved in the notification of domestic violence and of holding weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after having linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which is derived from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death figures are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
Films that show when it hit is now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck over the coast.
Federal Prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspect of terrorist attacks in New York City
The federal prosecutors of New York are prosecuting the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is supposed to have used a rental truck from the Home Depot construction chain to perform an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway on the bottom of Manhattan. He melted down pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious body damage, according to the deliberate declaration of death penalty submitted in the Southern District of New York.
Both points of charge may be a death sentence, according to the court case.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was prosecuted by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protection activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as the assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "wide planning and purpose", said the prosecutors, and at the same time described the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss", says the statement of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has not been prosecuted in a case where death penalty is claimed in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted for murder of two drug dealers, but finally sentenced to lifetime prison in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced for stamping to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekian citizen, showed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
According to the police, he reported to the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to the attack after watching IS movies on his phone.
He also asked to put the IS flag up in his hospital room, reported the police.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 accusations of the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, who claimed that they are "deprivedly disappointed" in the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to claim death penalty instead of agreeing to lifetime prison without the possibility of conditional release if the defendant acknowledges guilty only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim death penalty.
Member of the House of Tories says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at the Tories Conference.
The former UKIP leader said that the politicians must "feel the heat" of the EU sceptics when one of Mr May's own MEPs proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
At the March in Birmingham, the Conservative Member, Peter Bone, said that the United Kingdom would already "be gone" if Nigel Farage had been the Minister of Brexit.
However, the challenge facing Theresa May to make the deeply divided supporters reconciled has been aggravated by EU-positive torry members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive under the attack of Brexitan hangers, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to make a deal with Brussels despite the relapse, and force EU sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "causing".
Bone said at a mass meeting organised by the Leave Means Leave organization in Solihole that he wanted to "spole the Chequers agreement".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood by the row, we would have been out at this stage," he said.
Peter Bone, representing the Wellingborough district in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must spoil the Chequers agreement."
He clarified his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the allegations that the public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The thought that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue."
The Brexitan hanger Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Premier Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, it is impopulent in the party and in our election workers who are on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Drop the Chequers agreement and start listening."
And she added a sharp message directed to Theresa May: "Presidents may keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
At the meeting, Mr Farage said that the politicians had to "feel the heat" if they were to fail the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to say to them, 'We will not let you get away with it.'"
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to have our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilise the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governmental and proud UK."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists waving with paths with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour Parliamentarian Lord Adonis of the House mocked the conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"It is these people who say that they can have IT systems in place and all technology for Canada plus plus plus-agreement, for friction-free borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure father.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning a "ordinary thinker" to run for the presidential post.
The American Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "ordinate thinker about running into the presidential post" after the elections in November.
The newspaper Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke of his future during a city hall meeting in the west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and now stands for re-election in November against the Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Deputy Chairman of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She has been the subject of speculation that she might take over Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city house meeting with the voters since Donald Trump joined.
One person asked her if she was planning to run for the presidential post.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government.
A person arrested for the death shooting of the basketball player Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the killing of the LSU Basket player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for the ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to get help identifying a man who was seen on the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died of this," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through the 247 sports news site.
Wayde went between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been there and had a weapon, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and brought to the custody of the East Baton Rouge police.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, and intersized in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after team orders gave him winning over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out on dry as he defended his position during the first two shipyards, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the depot first and let Hamilton drive in the back of the cluster, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went in the deck on a shipyard later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of offering in place after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seven at the end of the first yard on his 21-year-old.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tyres to reach a fast goal and drive around Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he came in the depot of the 44th shipyard but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight shipyards when the Raikkon went up to the fourth place.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let by me.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and a two," Hamilton said.
Real Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, a nominal judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly raise the testimony from Ford before the Senate Justice Committee. Instead he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "evil, nasty and liar."
"The only thing that could happen and the fine thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, nasty and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't.
I haven't done it.'
Remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? Have you leaked the document? 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it.'
Wait a minute.
"Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter of details about Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I have not darkened Ford's accusations, I have not leaked her story," said Feinstein to the Committee, according to the newspaper The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wanted."
But her dementia does not seem to have fit the president, who, during Saturday night's meeting, commented on it this way: "I'll tell you something. That was really bad body language.
She may not have, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continues to support the candidate of the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual offences by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power with all the necessary means.
You see their cruelness and disgustingness. They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get power and control," said the president, according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars served Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-string line through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard signed for Dundee before two cases from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting for the season of the two laws, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening target came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assistance from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
During the intensive first period, Sullivan returned to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who signed at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again signed with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the profit with his team's fifth halfway through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of his last five games, will play home against Milton Keynes at his next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died because hundreds of people on a plane could escape earthquake
A leader in Indonesia is now tributed as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy afterquakes continue to torment the area and many are stuck in the rush in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly floating control tower at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged for a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We are devastated by hearing this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can rise to over a thousand people. The National Disaster Aid Authority says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of deaths is believed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the authority.
Up to six meters of waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in help and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute comes an ambulance with dead bodies.
There's not much clean water.
Mini markets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes at Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man is missing after a plane crashed in a lagun
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, the Pacific Ocean, now states that a man is missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had escaped from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said that it worked with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water when it tried to land at the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
On Friday officials reported that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and how the events looked.
The airline and the American Navy both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing path.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane slipped past the landing path.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade through middeep water to the emergency exits on the declining plane.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he had a smaller skull damage.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people into land before the plane sank in the 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea for the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analytics draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor closed his proceedings in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as expert witnesses in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to put together the 29-year-old prosecuted Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received localisation data from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, which contradicts his previous claims, reported the news newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis to tell him the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis reported that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis sometime after Chambers' death, Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information were deleted from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defence is planned to begin its termination on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that the hiphop has come far from its origin in political messages and to address social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?
A New York Childmaid votes for a couple due to the resignation of a "racist" text message
A baby girl in New York is voting for discrimination after having received an incorrect text message from the mother, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the mood with extortion.
Two-child mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed fear when she realized that the new Child Girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEJ NOT A SVART IGEN," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "no fashion", and fired Maurice, and claimed that their former childmaid, who was African, had done a bad job and instead she expected a Philippine woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in a cab.
Now she sues the couple for compensation for the resignation. She requests compensation in the order of 350 bucks per day for the job she was initially employed to do, which would be six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple reject the accusations that they would be racists and say that the only straight thing was to finish Giselle Maurice's employment. They were worried that they could not trust her when they had offended her.
"My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you confide your children in someone you had been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood to "extortion" and said that his wife would have born children two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Should you go to such a person?
It's not very nice done," added investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still underway, but the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticises them for their behaviour and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers didn't think that the readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington writer Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, commented on the letter as follows: "It is hard to imagine how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny, considering what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterly" after his death last year.
She describes that Paddington was a "very important member of our family" and added that her father was proud in the silence of her final success.
"He was quite quiet of himself, and no boastful person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. You get proud of the child even if it is not you who has accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little like that.
Even if it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the honor of himself."
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad that said that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be right there.
I'll come to you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive ebbed out slowly and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything went off.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I could not cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she was going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bowed my head down, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sorrowing women put up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost relatives because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his life when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells me her son was a promising chef who had a contagious smile.
"All knew who he was because of his smile.
They said that his smile lighted up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling after he had killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm always worried about consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "for people to know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit silent, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner since 15 years, Mark, sometime after his mother's death.
"He hadn't said he felt depressed or depressed or something," she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was acting differently.
On Christmas, he was on the bottom, and when the kids opened his Christmas presents, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says that his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to get through it. "It tears up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts investigation.
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited to time and extent - we might have some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the Committee would be "splitted" because of deeply rooted differences between the parties.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the time.
The middle-year elections will take place in only five weeks, on November 6th. If the Republicans make a bad choice, as expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary for George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the dead state and confirm his election in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean jumpers "sucker" under Kim
The number of North Koreans leaving South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Reunion of South Korea, says that 1 1 127 people skipped last year, compared to 2 706 in 2011.
Park says that harder border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges for smugglers are important causes.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Finally, the vast majority of hops from North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans are supposed to have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border to North Korea, and whose border is easier to cross than the hardly guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the jumpers as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between North and South, which technically is still in war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for conversations focusing on the fast-run negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work to make the Korean peninsula free from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US sanctions for the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we can certainly not disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a talk at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help that I thought that if a woman had acted like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the accusations of violating Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh became very emotionally touched, and sometimes he almost shouted and his voice cried when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats of the Committee and said that the accusations against him were a "grotean and coordinated character murder" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was partial to the disadvantage of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked the couple Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh before national court if he was elected, and if the Democrats were given the majority in the Representative House.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is at now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. appeal court.
Pelosi added that she as a Democrat was worried about what decisions Kavanaugh might take against the Health Insurance Act Affordable Care Act or the abortion case of Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether to amend certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
It is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," Pelosi said.
Women have to endure.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I received good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also wept when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began crying she said to the person she spoke to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she continued.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to get out of wrath partly because they are often misunderstood fundamentally.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once cried of unpredictable anger, was that I was taken in the collar of an older woman. It was a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she pulled me into a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sorry and they'll be happy that they managed to press you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with an extramarital deal on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to examine the idea of making up the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well-thinked decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the seven dwarves."
Since she was late, she was behind with the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate unless she got 2 million dollars together.
It was a project sentenced to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men just gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not start a formal presidential election campaign, she became so overwhelmed by emotions, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and direct to voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism, that the voice was jamming.
"You could have thought I had had a nervous breakdown," Schröder remembers about the press's reactions.
"You could have thought that Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, 'What shall they write on my tombstone?'
"She wept?"
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening path of the trade war between the United States and China was deafening. The war is far from over, but the crack between the countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
The United States President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by deploying important Chinese export products such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs duties.
The most important stepping this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion, means in practice that half of all goods coming into the United States of China are customs duties.
Peking has responded each time with the same coins. Recently, $60 billion was thrown at charges of between five and ten per cent on US goods.
China has promised to match the United States action. The world's second largest economy will probably not step down within a time limit.
Making Washington back is to bow down for demands, but public crawling for the United States would be too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
Experts, however, believe that if Beijing plays its short right, the press from the US trade war can provide a positive support for China in the long term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies on each other.
"A fast political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to acknowledge," says Abigail Grace, research assistant with focus on Asia at the thinking center for New American Security.
Syria "redo" for returning refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to receive voluntary returning refugees and appeals for help to build up the country, which lies in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Mr Walid al-Moualem, said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
"The location in place today is more stable and safe, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and living.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or help from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe departed with the victory in Ryder Cup, Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with final status 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team achieved the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the outbreak of the 16th pair of the hole 3-path, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever done 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was struck out 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest ranked players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have done its last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful European tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win the victory back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said a touched Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He handed over the stick to his countryman John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up looking at him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder cup.
A strange statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who have won 14 major titles, which has only been exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
The American captain Jim Furyk said after the depressing performance of the team: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
The hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really good.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to bow and bow.
They played better than we did."
The algae flowering: Halts decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wild Commission shows a general reduction in the concentrations of algae flowering for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, uneven flowers in the areas around the main municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier are reported.
The algae flower extends along over 200 miles of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Stains can be seen about one and a half miles into the sea outside the main municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algae flowering has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
High average concentrations in or outside the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside the Hillsborough coast low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or outside the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium high concentrations in or outside the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the main municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida during the last week.
