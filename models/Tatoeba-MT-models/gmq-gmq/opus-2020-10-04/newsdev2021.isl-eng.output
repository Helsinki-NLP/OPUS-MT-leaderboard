Biden leads viewing studies in three key states
With only 100 days of election, Joe Biden, a candidate of Democrats, enjoys a precedent in three important fluctuations.
CNN reports today that Biden was over to Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, the Biden has 51% of the follow-up to 46% of the president's follow-up.
In Arizona, the situation is 49%-45% Biden in favour and in Michigan is heading towards the superior Biden, because it leads by 12 points, 52%-40%.
To win the elections in November, in 100 days, Trump has to turn all these states, and actually more.
Trump is now experiencing a crown - viral epidemic that his countrymen are teaching him more and more about, saying that the vast majority of people in the United States have reacted badly, or very badly at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has made a bad reaction to protests and riots that arose at George Floyd’s death.
Thinks Trump and his government have offended or misrepresented them.
To crown Trump's problem, he is now under severe criticism for ordering federal police officers to break off protests in cities where city or government officials are Democrats.
Has it created enormous wolfish among the city’s inhabitants, and that anger spreads to other Americans?
Also, images of FBI police to pluck protestants into unmarked cars have not helped the United States.
Did the Lincoln Project's ad just draw attention to this, but it can be seen below.
Trump conquered all three states in 2016, but with very little vote difference.
Trump actually won very many states with a small vote and won the elections with a minority of votes.
For example, Michigan won with only 10,704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Nearly all the polls that political commentators say are showing the same conclusion, Biden is passed forward.
A new survey of the CNN in Arizona shows that Biden is now at the forefront of the scan.
The same is the case with CNN and Quinnipiac University of Florida.
Even Fox News, who leans well to the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published surveys of the same material in its media.
The President's last hope, according to the findings of the questionnaires, is that Trump might hope to return to important places in the fluctuation of the election campaign if attention is focused on the economy.
The U.S. economy took a heavy blow after the Covid-19 epidemic, but the voters do not seem to be linking the economic shock to the Crown Virus epidemic.
That is, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for having endured the reaction to the corona virus epidemic, but trust him more to deal with the economic shock that occurs in the state at this time.
However, Trump has failed to manage the discussion in the campaign.
In the wake of the riots that have burned almost continuously since the news came from the video, in which four policemen killed George Floyd, Trump tried to guide the discussion about the importance of law enforcement.
Law and Order, became his unique words.
It seems now to have failed completely, as previously said.
As the polls lean more on Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to abandon Trump and declare support for either Biden, or someone else, which is then Biden without mentioning him specifically.
This is because in the United States, they are choosing in many votes on the same ballot.
In this way, the voter can simply mark the second class in the presidential election part of the vote, and it alone can be voted for all the other candidates of that class in the voting order.
In this way, the candidates of the Republican Party are tempted to cut off the sluggish trump team and to achieve independent results in the elections.
Dakar’s youth’s Olympics Delayed to 2026
Youth Olympics were to be held in Dakar next year, which has now been postponed to 2026 because of the Crown Virus epidemic after the International Olympics Committee and Senegal agreed to do so.
However, the postponement of the first Olympic Games to be held in Africa is a shock for many young athletes.
Voluntary arrested for the fire of Nantes
A volunteer in the church in Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed the church.
Le Monde notes that the suspect, a refugee from Rwanda who served as a minister in the church, admitted to having set the fire on fire.
In a conversation with another media, the man’s lawyer says that the man cares greatly for his actions.
Among the things destroyed in the fire was an organ from the 17th century and historic decorated windows of the church.
The 39 - year - old volunteer, who has not been named, was arrested shortly after the 19th of July 18th, but was then released.
He was then returned to report last night and was taken to custody afterward.
“No way out of this ”
I am welcome at the home of Baltasar and Christjana Samper in Copavogi.
The reason for my visit is the new art show of Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, who will be opened on August 1, in the Ladder of Little Kambi on Snowfellsneck.
This is the first time the fathers show up.
I am taken down to Baltasar’s workhouse, where I see a magnificent painting.
Large and depressive pictures of women in the past, but also of flying creatures; eagles on one, shadows of birds on the other.
From the workplace, the home is expelled.
“ We had a horse here with us who bit the grass, ” says Baltasar.
“The horse works much better than a lawn mower on these hills and hills that we have. ”
Mireya, who is with Christjana and Baltasar, tells us how her works rhyme with the works here.
“Introduction, a mixture of paperwork and jewelry.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad's doing, because I'm working on the light and stuff," she says.
“ It was a year ago that idea came up.
Then there were some work I was doing and would have wanted to show there, but they were stuck in Tokyo out of Covid.
When my father started painting and I saw where he was going, I re-thinked my part," says Mireya, but Baltasar's works have strong pronouncements in Icelandic legends about female sponges and ponds.
“ When I saw that my father was doing these paintings with the ladies, I thought it would be a good idea to make jewelry related to them, ” says Mireya, who works with Winning No Bear son of gold in the store Sign.
"Then I'm making an insertion from the jewelry."
Last year, Mireya attended the 72 artists of the Academy of Sense at Snowfellsnesi, including in the Ladder of Little Kambi, and found the building fascinating.
“ This is a new space, an old load that has just been made up, ” says Mireya, who spoke to Baldvina Swarriest daughter of art, who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar set up a show together.
“ She wanted us both to show, and then we thought:
“ Why not?
That's a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain and studied at the Barcelona Art University before his world trip to study arts and research.
He came here in Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by a country and a nation.
Shortly afterward, he came back to meet his wife, Christjana, and has lived here since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a prominent artist, has held dozens of private shows, and shows with Christjana in many places.
He is the most famous for his large wall pictures, such as a wall decoration in the Familiar Church and Fresh in the West Side Church.
“ What affects what I do is the bitterness of Iceland and no other place, ” says Baltasar.
“ This low sun and these shadows that are stretching and stretching.
As soon as I came here, I thought, “Wow, here you can work. ”
Mireya is the oldest children of Christonia and Baltasar, born in 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was absolutely clear that I wasn’t going to become an artist, ” she asked if she wanted to follow her parents ’ steps.
“ So I went to high school for math and physics and did everything I could to get away with this.
Then I realized I was on the run.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laugh.
Like her father, she has shown many places around the world.
A lot in Japan, to picture.
All the children of Baltasar and of Christjanu have walked the list road.
“I call it a virus, ” says Mireya.
“ There was no way out of this. ”
Counts of Icelandair have been in a grey area when airmaids were dismissed
The social minister believes that Icelandair was in a grey area when the company resigned from all the maids in the middle of a heartbeat.
Then he claims that after the fire on the Broadcasting Trim, he has asked for a law against firemen to enter an apartment.
On July 17, Icelandair was advised to quit all the 38 flight mates who worked for the company while the nuclear company was still on the board of a national peace treaty.
The departments were aware of whether Icelandair was allowed to take up these resignations and prepared for the matter to be settled by the Society’s judgment.
However, flyers and Icelandair never ended up getting together more than 24 hours after the resignation.
On the other hand, Mr. Åsmund Einar, Minister of Social Affairs, says that in his view, Icelandair’s decision was in a grey area and came to the right of employees.
“ My opinion is that this is a certain right to defend the payers.
When you're in a conversation, when you're inside a negotiator, it's not an option to go this way.
It is absolutely clear to me that this would not have proved to be true.
I think it's quite clear, in my mind, that men had come into a gray area there what this touched," says Ásmundur.
Thus, he will not predict that other companies go the same way as Icelandair.
“ You also now see dangerous discussions that it is only normal to jump up this system to reduce this right, and that is why I’m totally opposed. ”
This morning, on the bombardment, Ásmundur was also asked about the government’s reaction to the fire of the city of Brothers at the end of June, where three were killed.
The Minister now says the study of the case on the board of the House and the Agency of Manufacturing, which he has made recommendations to.
“ It is in the law today that the firefighter must not enter an apartment.
I have asked the House and Manufacturing Agency to look specifically at whether there is a reason to make any legal changes.
I am ready to make the legal changes that are necessary to reduce the likelihood that these things can happen again," says Ásmundur Einar.
You can listen to the interview with Ásmund as a whole in the player below.
United States said increased pressure on Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
According to Welt am Sonntag, the U.S. government has made further attempts to force a European company to abandon the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is led by Russia.
According to the newspaper, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Energy have contacted European entrepreneurs to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to 12 officials should have held at least two network meetings with representatives of the companies in the last days.
Those who witnessed the talk said that the Americans had “friendly ” emphasised that the United States wanted to prevent North Stream 2 from being a reality.
“I think this is a very, very serious threat, ” said one dryer to the German press.
These threats are in line with the comments of the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo last week, when he warned that companies participating in the project would be best to “get out now ” or be at risk of penalties according to 232 parts of the notorious law of Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy crisis Gazprom, which supervises the development of the project, five European companies are involved.
This is the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell, as well as Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with Welt am Sonntag, the representative of the latter company said that the US attempts to undermine “important infrastructure projects” were clearly intervening in the European Union.
Earlier in the week, the U.S. Representative Congress approved a change in the laws on land protection designed to extend the U.S. penalties against companies involved in the installation of the Russian North Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the carriers of the law-based broadcast, the options can be directed to companies providing or providing ships, guarantees, porting positions or connecting services for such ships, as well as those offering a Nord Stream certificate.
Both European corporations and officials have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of the United States’ efforts to intervene in European energy by applying penalties against Nord Stream 2, and some have even called for Brussels to work on counteracting.
Moscowists have also critically criticized the operation from Washington and called it unfair competition.
Earlier in the week, Dmitrij Peskov, spokesman of the president, said that Russia would set up a new plan for the completion of the project if Washington’s presidents were keeping the new penalties at stake.
Preparing further transfers of official agencies to land
The Social and Child Minister intends to move more public institutions into the country next.
The brunavarna area of the House and the Manufacturing Agency will be moved north to the Sheep Crown in the autumn of the Minister's decision, but experts in the department have previously declared that they are not planning to move north.
Asmund Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, said in the Bomberand at the Bay this morning that it would be important for the countryside to be transferred to public institutions.
Hence, there is a great variety of value creations.
“ It is nationally important, we are trying to build everything around the country.
Employment building, monetary building, whether in travel services, agriculture, industry, some kind of natural utilization, and this kind of work as public works, they are very supportive for that structure," says Ásmundur.
“Creating increased diversity, creating better support for this resource utilisation and the creation of the national currency.”
The Ásmunds decision to move the fire-fighting area of the Agency for Bodies and Manufacturing has been severely criticised by its employees and by the National Association of Firefighters and Healthcare Transporters.
Six people who have special knowledge of fires and work in the department are all living in the capital area, and none of them are planning to move livestock to a sheep’s hook.
“ I think it’s clear that there is political differences in how hard it should be.
My view is, and has always been, that we should attack radical actions to better distribute the official work," says Ásmundur.
“ We see that our neighboring nations, Northmen, and Danir have been doing this successfully. ”
He is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see a greater distribution of the public institutions throughout the country.
“I think there is a need to make further political decisions on the transfer of public services to the country, just as I was doing with a Housing and Manufacturing Agency. ”
He takes an example of the transportation of the Food Agency to Selfoss, the Iceland Measurers to Akraness, and the Unemployment Insurance on the Skagast Beach.
“ It’s a workplace on Skagast Beach today that matters to that society.
I think we should take further steps into this being."
“ I am preparing for further steps in this realm.
More transportation."
Fifty arrested in Seattle
The systematic racism and the decision of the President of the United States to send federal police forces into cities to settle riots were protested in many places yesterday.
In fifteen Protestant people were arrested in Seattle.
The Seattle police used flame bombs and pepper sprays in massive protests last night, which the police have described as riots.
21 police officers were injured, and at least 45 Protestants were arrested.
Two months later, protesting against systematic racism began in the United States after a police officer killed George Floyd.
The protestant was led to a convergence of the Protestants in Portland.
There has been repeated conflicts between police and Protestants after the U.S. President sent U.S. Army forces that have driven unmarked cars to unthankful authorities.
Thousands met in Portland this weekend, using the police of teary gases and rubber coils when they struck a bust between them and the Protestant.
Miraculous Child Experienced 47
The U.S. reality star Kenya Moore takes advantage of strengthening people who need technology for reproduction.
Moore, known for his participation in the shows The Real Housewives of Atlanta, had her first child 47 years of age after technological fertilisation and called her daughter the miraculous child.
“ Almost all my life was waiting to have a baby, ” said Moore in an interview with People.
“ So I know the anguish that people feel, especially women, to think that I might not have a baby. ”
Moore realized that when she was 40 years old, she was running out of time.
“ I didn’t want to have a baby alone.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited and was 40 years old, I looked up and thought my god good," said Moore, who didn't know her father until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The real star says that her daughter is a miraculous child in more than one way.
In addition, Moore was older than most of the firstborns, her daughter came into the world one and a half months before the day.
Moore went to an emperoric canal that proved to be difficult and took much longer than a conventional emperor canal.
“ I call her the miraculous baby, ” said Moore during the interview, “because it was a child that everyone said was almost no chance for me to have. ”
Feeds arrested in Mizoram for 15.4 million heroin rupies

A man and his son were arrested with 1.9 kilograms of heroin in the Hnahthial district of Mizoram, near the border of Myanmar, after the police on Sunday.
The domestic value of the heroin was about 15.5 million rupees, which, according to the police, was smuggled from Myanmar.
Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested with drugs on Friday evening in the village of Ngharchhip, said the police.
They also lost about 280 grams of heroin, the value of some 1.5 million rupees when they swim over, while fleeing from the police, as reported by the officials.
According to police information, this is considered to be one of the highest levels of heroin held in the state.
The defendants were brought to justice in accordance with the appropriate law on drugs and hallucinations (NDPS) of 1985.

The Assam rifles recently captured 25 trucks of loaded Bethel nuts smuggled from Myanmar, worth about 40 million rupis.
A doctor ran 35 miles (35 km) with a mask
On the days of the British doctor Tom Lawton ran 35 kilometers with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation was not reduced with facial masks.
Lawton is a doctor at Bradford Royal Hospital. He's been working there during the pandemic.
To reject the theory of oxygen saturation and to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run for work and back with a mask.
Before he started, he set up a collection at GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust, which provides food gifts in Bradford and in Britain.
“ I am a great supporter of everything that keeps us safe.
That's why I've been shocked by the wrong information that has been transmitted between people about a face mask reducing the oxygen saturation in people," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously competed in a triangle, but during the pandemic he had endured.
On Monday, he ran the 35 miles [35 km].
“I never took off the mask (no food or drink) and the oxygen saturation was 98% firm every time I looked, ” wrote Lawton on Twitter after running.
Prince Joakim still in the hospital

Gottlieb warns that the unsteady spread of the Crown Virus in society makes it “very difficult ” to open schools in the fall
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commander of the United States Food and Medicine Surveillance, warned on Sunday that it would be “very difficult ” for school districts to open during a new year of study if the crown virus spreads without delay within these communities.
“ I believe that local school authorities need to look at the spread within society.
If the virus spreads freely in society, it will be very difficult to open in that state," said Gottlieb in “Face the Nation”.
Since the falltime is to begin in the next weeks, Trump’s government had encouraged the school authorities to open their schools to students and to offer training at school five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and Minister of Education, Betsy DeVos, come a week after Trump warned that the crown virus epidemic would probably “be worse before he recovers ” and confirmed that school districts in those places where the worst situation might have to be delayed for a few weeks.
However, on Thursday, disease centers gave instructions on how to open schools safest.
The instructions include the distance between people, students and staff from schools to face protection and the switching of students into separate groups to reduce infectious routes.
However, the Centers for Disease Protection did not provide guidelines for school managers to determine when to close schools if the number of coronary virus viruses is increasing, as Gottlieb says has been “bad luck. ”
“ When there is a state of uncertainty and precise guidance on how schools will be opened, ” he says, “I think more parents will be careful. ”
“ For this reason, I consider it very important to obtain accurate information about the precise standards that the disease centers did not provide in their instructions. ”
Gottlieb told school districts to consider the proportion of positive infections in society, local spread, and test capabilities when decisions are made about whether to keep schools open or to switch them to online teaching.
If between 5 and 10% of the analyses produce a positive conclusion, “the matter is going to be difficult” but over 10% is “the threshold when carefully considering whether to close the schools. ”
“ This is a sign that the epidemic has reached its foothold in society, ” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make parts of Florida, the central center of the coronary virus epidemic in the United States, difficult to open up for schooling next month.
The number of coronavirus viruses has increased in more than 30 states and Colombia, but the central center of the epidemic is currently in the sunbelt called the South Coast of the United States.
However, Gottlieb said that there is evidence that there is a slowdown in the number of cases in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
But although Gottlieb said that there was “a remarkable sign ” of slowing down the epidemic in some states in the sunbelt, there is“ heat in the coal ” in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, India, and Illinois.
Many governors have set rules that oblige people to use masks in public spaces and have stopped the relocation of targets to prevent the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that governments should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people at restaurants, closing cinemas and other places that offer entertainment indoors, and setting rules on masking to overcome the epidemic, which are actions that allow governments to avoid reopening the strict limitations set at the beginning of the epidemic in March.
In addition to the use of masks by some states, various companies have obliged people to use face defenses.
The McDonald's quick-bitter is the latest company to make the use of face defenses to be added to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules on masking.
Gottlieb said that he assumed that more companies would take up a masking obligation with him, especially as the danger is considered to be high.
“ If we can really control the epidemic when winter begins until we receive vaccines or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease, we can do so with masks, that’s relatively simple, something we can all do but that does not directly change our life and allows us to keep things that are very important to us, such as keeping some businesses open and bringing the kids back to school, ” he says.
Despite the fact that Donald Trump did not wish to make mask use in the entire country last week, he urged the Americans to use face defenses and at the White House press conference said that “they are influential. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave the Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson, “It’s news to expect. ”
The followers of the Crystal Palace were shocked for the summer when Roy Hodgson, director of the Society, declared that the congressman, Wilf Zaha, wanted to leave the company.
The elephant race has played at Selhurst Park for more than five years and seems to be on its way, but it has been made up with a team such as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, it will be found whether a team in that quality class is still willing to pay a high sum for him, especially during the financial uncertainty of the sport this summer, after a period where Zaha scored four marks and made five supports for the Palace team, which caused some disappointment.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that “good news is expected ” about Zaha’s possible departure after confirming that the congressman had“ made it clear ” that he would see his future elsewhere than in the company.
There are still three years left of the constituent’s agreement with the Palace, and last year, the Society indicated that 100 million bucks would be needed for the company to deliver it.
Hodgson’s team ended the period with seven consecutive losses and equals on the last day of the season, which led the team to fall down to 14th place.
Zaha found a net strap only once from mid - December to the end of the period with a long - shot loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had requested sale last summer when he tried to get away from the company, but no offer was made to tempt the Palace to sell.
Zaha changed the agent in January, apparently to increase the chance of getting out of the company, and in the next few weeks, he will be undoubtedly preceded by securing social change.
Zaha, the player who played most of the minutes in the English election department for the Palace during the period, was the only player of the team under the age of 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much reconstruction of the team could be necessary to attack the funds available to the player.
Orkanen Hanna: The Korean Virus of Texas faces a high risk of catastrophic floods in “double plagues”
After the two - in - country hurricane Hanna, in southern Texas, has predicted “consequences, ” resulting in heavy rainfalls and winds up to 40 meters per second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, he was ranked as a first-stage storm (bottom-stage at five-speed scales) and has now been moved down into a tropical storm, but rain could still amount to 150 - 300 mm on Sunday, and the wind could reach 26 meters per second.
In some areas, rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County at the border of Mexico.
Hanna was the first hurricane in the Atlantic Sea in 2020, and weather scholar Chris Birchfield advised the inhabitants to be on guard: “This is not nearly over yet, and we are still expecting disaster floods. ”
For the past few weeks, Texas has been struggling with a great increase in the presence of corona virus virus.
The governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster announcement for 23 counties on the road, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are a tremendous challenge.
This challenge is complicated and even harder where the hurricane passes through a region that has become the worst because of COVID-19," Greg said.
The hurricane first came to land at 5:00 a.m. on Saturday, 24 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, about 20 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far away, in the eastern Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, had no electricity on Saturday night.
The Corpus Christi Emergency Service set up gardens near the gateways to allow them to be used in case of crossroads.
U.S. president Donald Trump said in a hurry that the government was watching the design and hurricane of Douglas, headed for Hawaii in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the coast of Corpus Christi, said that the storm approaching had increased her anxiety over the pandemic.
This 67 - year - old woman had remained at home mostly because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double strike for us.
I think a lot of people are getting nervous.
We'll get through this.
They're all good and strong and stand together."
Highness of a Blossoming sailing in Southern Europe
In some Southern countries, hearing has been unusually successful, and the weather has been a favourable one for farmers.
Most have had the first slaughter, the second slaughter has begun in many places, and it is expected that some will reach the third slice at the end of the summer.
The weather has been playing with southern farmers, like other inhabitants of the countryside this summer, and it does not spoil farmers.
So hearing has gone well.
The winner of Augustsson, a cow farmer in Birtingaholt, in a ravage, and an entrepreneur in hayship is happy and happy.
“ Yes, it’s just been brilliant, I think farmers have to be steep; they’ve been fine and they’ve been very good weather in the last six months.
The ears are very good, but the harvest is good, and the goodness of the harvests is good all over," says Sigurd.
Sigurd says that it is growing, especially in the cows, that they are haying in flat pits or outdoors, which have been given very well, but it is the longest thing to do in the rolling hearing.
“ It’s a lively, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable now for the last six months or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good, and it’s so comfortable to deal with this.
It makes everything the same, it is less stressful and can be stored until the morning, sometimes what could be done today, so it is brilliant comfortable.
But does Victory think that some farmers will beat three times?
“ Yes, I could believe that, those who were first.
We started on June 17, it could be that those who were the first have to take something three times."
Initial solution in the wolves - How to prevent injuries
The Canteen Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English department, is an extremely fast player.
His opposers have taken hold of him to make sure that he does not get past them.
This has caused his shoulder to fall out several times, but now the wolves have provided a solution to the problem.
The Sun reports this.
In Wolves' game against the Crystal Palace, medical officers could see an ointment on Traore's shoulders.
“ This is something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says a source of Wolves, a child oil.
“ Making him smoother makes it more difficult for defenders to grasp him, and that way we can prevent further injuries. ”
Traoré's shoulders first fell off when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has fallen out of team four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Prince Harry England: A friend of the Duke of Sussex protests claims in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott said in a conversation with Sky News that the contents of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were in no different content of the gossip magazines, the only difference was that the book was built in.
The ex - soldier wants the sea to be more directed to the positive things that he and his wife have done, such as their charity work.
Stott said: “I feel that what is stated here is in no way different from what we read in the gossip magazines, except now only in a written book. ”
“ There is a storyteller who tells, yet there is no certainty that it is from them. ”
“I think this is just another attack on them, just like the gossipers who persecute them. ”
“ I realize that they are on the scene and people want to know what they are doing, but I wish that they would be more concerned about all the good things they have done and their charity work, rather than their personal affairs. ”
“ Of course, they will never get away from it, because of their position. ”
The support of the Duke and the Duke of Sussex overshadowed other members of the royal family, according to an expert in the history of the royal family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had failed to benefit Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
She added, however, that the order of power within the king’s family was firmly formed, but that it was not possible to control the interest of the public.
She also said: “The fact is that everything they did to support the queen tended to overshadow other members of the royal family, and this was considered a problem. ”
"They are very popular."
“ They had less weddings than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“ But although Harry’s and Meghan’s weddings were smaller than by Willhjál and Katrine, news transmission was just as much, because of the worldwide interest in the couple. ”
Donald Trump admits that he often regrets his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has acknowledged that he often regrets his posts on Twitter that promote war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States said that his undesirable remarks of Twitter records — some of which have contained material from white racialists — would bring him in the most troublesome situation.
When journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he regretted his posts, Trump replied: “Oft, too often.
It was so in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very big.
You put it on your desk and then you came back the next day and said, "Oh, I'm glad I didn't send this," right?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out immediately, we feel great, and then someone starts getting calls — “Did you really say this? ”
I say, “What’s the matter? ” and you’ll find out something. ”
Last month, Trump caused a lot of anger after reappearing a record (divided material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area in Florida, where an elderly couple called “White power! ” or “the power of whites”.
And in 2017, Trump reaffirmed three entries directed against the Muslims, published by Jayda Fransen, head of the right extremist class of Britain First.
The president told Portnoy that the restorations that had put him in the most trouble
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t study it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what it says on your helmet, which is a little bit small and you don’t grow it, sometimes – I’ve found that it’s almost always the restoration that causes you trouble. ”
The president often shares commendation to himself, a voice about his opposers, and conspiracy with 80 million of his followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him get through the so - called “false news ” of television shows and newspapers, which he says are transparent by false truth.
But the President’s own lies have often been found in the microscope, and now the Twitter entries of Trump mean misleading.
The GPS system may be insecure
Many states are working on a different location technology than the GPS system.
Engineeringlektor says there may be a reason to worry about the safety of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been renewing life.
GPS's tracking us at every footstep.
We use it when flying, sailing, and driving, in land measurements, in industry, and in leisure.
Most people do not think that it is a military device owned by the U.S. Army, which first opened it for general use in the 1980 ’ s.
The GPS technology uses coordinates from a satellite to a height of 20,000 miles above the ground, so conditions in nature have little effect on it.
“ But it’s very easy to disturb her.
And malicious people can easily disrupt the reception of these marks," says Semund E. Thorsteinsson, a professor of engineering at Iceland University and a specialist in risk management and safety of communication.
He also says that it is easy to send error signs with a wrong location, such as in warfare.
“ The GPS system is owned by the U.S. Defence Department.
They have assured the public that the system is ready at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it pushed into the head of a very special president to make such a thing, he could probably do it," says Seamundur.
Thus, many states will be considering other systems and location techniques.
Both the Russians and the Chinese operate their own satellite system, and the European Union is pushing Galileo’s location system out of the stocks.
“Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may be more accurate and naturally controlled by the European Union.
Then there is not one government who will rule it completely, but many," says Semundur.
But many people are also looking back to the old Loran technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the '60s until GPS technology took over.
The loran marks are sent on very long waves from sent down on the ground.
“ It is then a new version of the Loran system, which stands for Enhanced Loran, that people are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a precaution, because it is a little different law to interfere with it, much more difficult than to interfere with the satellite system, ” says Semundur.
However, it is probably safest to have access to most location systems.
Experienced Senator Vern Buchanan died by the crown virus
“Gary was a professional in the finger and a loyal servant of the public, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched the lives of so many and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how refreshing he was, the sense of humor, and the great joy he had from helping others."
Buchanan’s office published a statement earlier in the month that Tibbetts had no recent contact with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had served for Buchanan since 2011.
Florida has reported 414.511 cases from the beginning of the pandemic, which are more than 411.200 in New York, according to the National Health Authority.
The data of the National Health Authority show that hospital deposits have increased by 79% since the U.S. National Festival, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 intensive care departments in Florida reached the thresholds on Saturday.
“ We informed him that this could have an effect, ” said DeSantis in June.
“At the same time, police work and putting lawsuits on this could have the opposite effect. ”
A Flight From Hornafir to Cape Town
Turk doves, roses, ring doves, cross - nephews, glitters, and tears are among the birds that have come into this country this summer.
On the web of the Southeastern birds, birds can see short news about the complications, where they have been seen, and sometimes their sex.
They are many bird - interested people in Iceland.
To illustrate this, the number of people who like the Facebook page is Icelandic birds.
The members of the group are about 14,600.
It is shared in pictures of birds, and it is evident that Iceland is rich in good photographers who have the patience needed to produce birds.
Brynja, son of Brynjalf, is one of them.
Yours, as it is called, is an employee of the Southeast and Southeastern Bird Surveillance Center and is closely watching the bird life in that area.
He beautifully speaks of these animals that enrich the life of Iceland and play an important role there, and it doesn’t matter whether the bird is a large and large rodent or a small sparrow.
The bird inspection station was established in 2005 on the birthday of Half-dán Björnsson in the Dead Islands, with the aim of lifting and continuing his powerful natural research from 1940.
“ A thirteen - year - old year - old, ” says a Brynja in a conversation with the Corner, “when he began to collect information about birds. ”
“ We at the bird checkpoint are not doing exactly what Half - Death did, but are building on his data by counting and marking birds. ”
A farmer and a common scientist was half dead, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles about plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, almost 90 years old.
Half - dead with his siblings in Kniquets, many of whom met Icelandic nature were interested.
This includes Björn Gísli Arnarson, “the other employee ” of the Bird Surveillance Station.
Björn grew up in the Provival in the Southern League and was richly rich in his neighbors, Half-dead in the Victics.
But what does the Southeast bird Surveillance Station really do?
Each year, about 20 March, the bird - checking station sets up a special bird - set in a lonely wooden park within the base of the Hornafurd.
Standard markings are made on the birds that come into the nets.
The nets are taken down around May 10, when the casting time begins.
The nets are up every day, at least from about six o’clock in the morning and until noon.
And they have to visit every hour.
The birds in them are marked, measured, and then released again into freedom.
Every hour, a reporter wonders.
“ Yes, we share it, me and Bjässi.
Since we now have to work for ourselves, this can be a lot of puzzle, but somehow we'll be able to do this," says Brynjelf.
The nets are then rebuilt in the period from August 1 to November 10 — every day that weather permits.
Between guarding the nets and the periods that they are not living, Brynjalves and Bear mark the crowns, the shovels, and the various mosaic birds where they reach them.
In addition, they take on various special assignments.
One of these projects is to work together with the Iceland National Institute of Natural Science and to collect birds.
“ The forest center jumps on the birds at their winter stations and then takes them here to land in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, so these timbers are not big when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find another host when he needs it."
But enough of timber.
Asking how the birds in the southeastern country were doing this summer, Brynja says that the bird’s cast seems to be good — where it is over her head.
“ The top of the bucket here is at Hala, a Southern Navy, where everything is going well.
But there is no more to be found at the river Jacula, where a few years ago there was a huge leap."
He says that a few years ago, there were over 1,000 pairs of cripples, but now they can be counted on one’s fingers.
“ When we look at moo and mushroom birds, I feel that in the past few years it has been reduced what you feel of them.
But of course, there's always a change between years."
According to Brynjelf’s report, what can explain that great change is most likely about the supply of food.
“Yes, it's all about food. ”
Then, too, man’s work may have to say about the survival of birds and other animals.
But some birds seem to have a pretty good time in the Southeast of the summer.
“ One of the positive things that I think is to choose is to increase again after high levels, ” says Brynja, “but during the last few decades, the swamps have declined horribly. ”
From sparrows, it appears that the marijuana is going to do well in its garbage this summer, just as it was last year.
Forest thrusters and twigs had reduced slightly, but Brynja says that it does not appear until in the fall of the summer, how they proved to be.
But let's go to the delusions.
Often they draw great attention, especially if they are very unseeable and even colorful.
These two interesting features have one of the most popular complications of the summer: the Rose Star.
“ Otherwise, it has been relatively quiet in the summers, ” says Brynjelf but mentions that in the country there is now a crying trunk and then a ring pigeon has been seen and is now laying down here.
When a Brynja and a Bear get in the eye of a traitor, they also mark them, just as other birds do.
Markings are international, and they are practiced worldwide.
There are a number of things that can be learned from the meanings, such as the winter stations of the birds, the locations and the routes of the birds.
“ It is even possible to see how long they are traveling, ” points a Brynja.
This information is useful in many ways, for example in the case of epidemics such as birds.
“ Knowledge is always being increased. ”
If anyone in the world finds a bird marked by the Southeast bird checkpoint, the information is sent to Iceland’s National Institute of Natural Science.
“ We have been restored from Cape Town in South Africa.
There we found a crown that we had marked.
One penny from us was found later in the United States."
One bird is a Brynjaw in particular, and it is the swamp.
“ The swamp is our bird, ” he says, and he points out that the bird’s observation station and the Southeastern National Agency have the task of observing his survivors — which has become quite defective and now he has come to trouble.
It is difficult to claim what caused the strain to collapse, but one of the theories is that the swamp has made itself a seafood that was previously disposed of by fishing boats and into the sea for good than that it is now becoming much more utilized and affects the swamp.
Are you in the best place in the country to watch birds?
“ You don’t naturally get me to say no, ” laughs the Brynja and adds, “Because we’re also pursuing traitor birds, we must probably go further. ”
Of course, the Southeast is special when it comes to bird life.
“ This area is as if it were invaded from Europe, but then the birds spread out of here.
Being here to look at birds and birds is very interesting, but there is less to be found of varp birds than in other lands.
It's not far from celebrity and to glacier, so the area that this is suitable for observation of birds."
But does Brynjalf have a favorite bird?
He thinks about it for a little while before he answers.
I think the question is difficult.
“ My bird is my bird, ” he says, “and I have found nine of the ten seen on the land. ”
“ I now find it most enjoyable to take pictures of horsesaws.
It's always fun to find birds that haven't been seen before in this country or are rare, so I don't talk about finding a new species for Europe."
But that's what both of your companions and Bässi have done.
If you want to monitor more closely the work of Binna and Bässa at the Southeastern Bird Surveillance Station, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the web of Birds.is
Saudi Arabia – The Sun Beach of the Future? No alcohol or bikini
The tourist industry has grown tremendously in many parts of the world in recent years, and now the authorities in Saudi Arabia want their share of the cake.
Governments are presuming to spend about $60,000 billion on making a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reports this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that Iceland and I should get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available and women will not be allowed to solar themselves in bikinium.
But how, then, should tourists be attracted to this strictly religious Islamic land?
For example, this is to be done by building a new city of white beaches, a moon (of course made by humans), tram - rental cars, and robots serving people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will be picked up in the oil supply of the land.
The Crown Prince says that there is no discussion that women can let go of covering their shoulders and knees in public places but admits that it is not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in the country, for it is too hot there when the sun is high and it cannot be trusted in wind cooling.
However, it may be wondered if it does not also reduce the interest of future tourists if they are unable to buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, formerly cast by the Presidential Chair of the Central African Republic, announced a presidential call
On Saturday, the former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been cast off, announced that he would appear in the presidential elections in December, despite the fact that the United Nations is carrying out penalties and that his criminal offences against humanity had been issued.
He announced his offer in a speech in front of a large group of supporters in his group, Kwa na Kwa (“work, only work”), in the capital of Bangui.
This 73 - year - old former general and general was deprived of power in 2013 in the Alliance’s revolt to the greatest Muslim rebels from the north who cast the majority of the nation to Christianity into a violent civil war and a severe and long - lasting human war.
“The country needs a man with experience, peace, and conviction, ” said Bozize in a speech critical of the current president’s office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
In 2003, Bozize was first elected after the robbery and served as president for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for a crime against mankind and for encouraging a genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile in the late year.
The impact of the Arrest Order or foreign penalties on it is unknown.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to cancel the retaliation that was imposed in 2014 for the purpose of supporting armed anti-balaka Christian groups.
Touadera today runs the country with the support of the UN’s vast security of peace, numbering over 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016, and he is expected to offer for another period that has not been confirmed.
The first round of the elections will be December 27th.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace treaty with 14 armed groups who usually claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violence has declined, but there are still bloody incidents that are mostly caused by resource conflicts, but the majority of this country is not under government control.
Violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
The state of Gareth Bale of Real Madrid is “incompatible for everyone, ” says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, the center of Real Madrid, says Gareth Bale’s status of the Spanish team is “unacceptable for all. ”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team, and he took little part in the LaLiga celebration of Los Blancos, and now this summer has come up the plight that the player intends to stay still and let his contract run out, but the company hopes that he will disappear.
“ There is no way to avoid the situation being unacceptable to everyone, ” said Kroos on the charger Lauschangriff Endlich was my sport.
“ He was not bought to play as little as he is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company actually said "yes" but then "no" later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about that.
When asked if the situation had affected Real’s atmosphere negatively, Kroos said: “Not as much as you could imagine.
I've known him for six years, and we've worked important things together."
Chinese give Reykjane’s city 2,000 face masks to support the fight against the crown virus
The Chinese ambassador, Jin Zhijian, delivered two thousand face masks to the Mayor of Reykjane’s town during the last week.
The reason was the mayor’s visit to the Chinese embassy on July 22, last.
Weak news first reported.
The mayor’s visit was to repay the Chinese ambassador’s visit to Reykjanes, where he visited the city hall and met the mayor.
Reports Vikur News that there was a discussion on promoting a friendship between Reykjane’s town and the city of Xianyang, but the urban communities began their cooperation between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, is rooted in this community of friends, but the city authorities in Xianyang wanted to give masks and thus support the battle against the corona virus epidemic.
Reports in the News News that the masks will be used in the sensitive institutions and offices of Reykjane’s towns for both employees and other guests.
In addition to the flags of Iceland and the People’s Republic of China, the inscription on the face mask box reads “Ber is behind each other, except for his brother. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - calculator by lowering the pay
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from the KR of Iceland, next month and claims to be interested by friends in the Danish First Division.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and has become the Champion of Iceland with both Val and KR.
However, this 27 - year - old attendant claims to miss Denmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania, daughter of Jacob.
The Danan agreement with the KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish company had to negotiate with the KR for a purchase price to get it in August, before a new season starts in Denmark.
Otherwise Thomsen would have to wait until winter to get to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know the Danish departments will start again at the end of August.
That means, of course, that I had to break my contract with KR-ings, but I've told them that I miss Danmark, and they have full understanding of it," said Thomsen to bold.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with a trainer named Rúnar Kristinsson, who had fully understood his position, and Thomsen said that he did not think the price would be a big problem.
“ I have also had conversations with two members of the first division after that department was finishing and the past knew where they would end.
There has already been a little interest in the coming periods, so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Iceland department stops," said Thomsen but added that there are not many partners in Denmark who could buy up his deal with KR.
“ It is not quite clear now, but it has been an interest.
I also need to find the best chance for me and my girlfriend, who's from Iceland, and who's coming with me.
It depends on a few things," said Thomsen, and said, "The first of all, look at the harbour of the merchants."
Thomsen said KR-ings don't have to worry that he wouldn't give up all his exercises and games, even though he missed Denmark.
“ KR knows what it gets from me, and it is that I do things 100 percent.
I can look far beyond the fact that I miss Danmark when I'm on practice or playing games," said Thomsen, who clearly says that he's going to lower his wages by leaving the Iceland Champions in the next department of Denmark.
“ I will probably need to lower my wages only because of the crown virus crucifix, which seems to have devastating the Danish buddies a little more than the Icelandic.
But I also study, and one solution might be that a company provided me with a job.
Most of the members of Division 1 have an agreement with sponsors.
I'm learning sports management through the Playplay Association, and I'm finishing the Bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the first team of KR in two games in the Pepsi Max Division in this season, but has been in five games and scored one score.
He started 21 games before the last year and scored seven limits.
The KR is equal to the scores of the Pepsi Max Division and a game, but the team meets the KA at Akureyri today.
Intervening about the corona virus on board a bus when a driver gets into a hot fight about face masks
The video shows passengers and drivers aboard an Arriva Street Wagon in Liverpool dealing with masking.
The driver hears an explanation to a woman that it is not his job to tell passengers to use a mask.
The driver said: “It’s not my job to tell everyone who steps up in the car to use a mask. ”
Concerning the incident, Witnesses said: “A man and an older woman began to get involved, and there was a lot of quarrel. ”
“ The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was going on, and he told one woman that she wasn’t even using the mask properly. ”
“ The woman then fled out of the carriage and said she was going to report the incident. ”
A spokesman named Arriva said: “The security of our customers and employees is as well our priority.
“Our clients are also required to use masks when using public transport (exceptions apply).”
“Clarified guidance and labelling for customers regarding this and all other distance rules are on board buses, community media and our website.”
Since June 15, masking has been in force in public transportation.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been identified worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
Worldwide, more than 9,90,000 people have recovered from the corona virus.
Most cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the United States, over 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to hire people with disabilities more often in their roles
The actor participates in a new effort to increase the participation of people with a disability in the recreation sector.
The action is taking place at the same time as 30 years has passed since the U.S. law on the rights of people with disabilities, which comes on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer discusses the importance of people seeing themselves and their lives truly reflected on the screen.
“ Nothing can replace personal experience and genuine photographs, ” she says.
“This is why it's so important to hire an appropriate actor in an appropriate role. ”
Spencer spoke of the effect of seeing skin - dark people on the screen when she was a little girl watching the “Good Times ” show.
The themes shown in the CBS from 1974 to 1979 were made by Norman Lear, and they were the first to show two parents of African origin.
A organization against hunger push Yoho to the side after an incident in the House
WASHINGTON (AP) – Irrespective of a Christian organization who wants to end hunger, on Saturday they said that they had waited for Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the regime of the organizations, and that after what they called “attack ” on the Senator Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez.
Congressman Ocasio-Cortez, Democrata of New York, accused Yoho, a representative of the Republic of Florida, of using a lowly and manly reproach when he rebuked her when they met at the stairs of the Senate last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the wording was as she described it.
Bread for the World stated that the government of the organizations had met Yoho on Friday and sought to relieve him “to justify our commitment to stand with women and skin - dark people, domestics, and worldwide, leading us towards the world with an increase in participation of all races and increased justice. ”
On the World’s website, Bread says that their “co - Christian voice ” pressures the Congress and governments to put an end to hunger in the country and worldwide.
“ Since Bread for the World is independent of a Christian organization that aims to reduce hunger and poverty by trusting public policies, the organization maintains the respect, dignity, and concern that Jesus asks us to show when dealing with people in power positions, anywhere in political color, ” says the statement.
“ Our assessment reflects recent actions and words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, not the moral requirements of our government members. ”
During the story, Yoho’s spokesman had not answered an e - mail message to respond.
In an amazing speech at the Senate last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez dramatically spoke of the incident and directed his words against what she called a manly teaching that “accepts violence and violence against women. ”
More than a dozen of her associates agreed with her that the incident was an example of overly common men’s behavior.
Yoho described the incident as a short discussion on policy and “no one had been disturbed, mocked, or attacked. ”
He said that he regretted showing “a stumbling attitude. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is a prosperous congressman, and she has received both praise and retribution for her cleanness.
The 65-year-old Yoho is one of the most conservative members of the Senate of Representatives, and he will sit down on a sanctuary after his fourth term of election.
Waited until 98 minutes in the locals to score the first mark of the season

Players Real Madrid Exemption Professional Rules
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England in their second game with Manchester City, in the Championship of Europe, without having to go to a two-week clinic.
The British government has decided that Spain’s tourists have to take a two - week diploma in order to block the spread of the crown virus.
However, there are exceptions, as in the case of race teams at the highest level of sports.
This confirmed the Sky Sports sports minister.
The Ministry says that the persons exempted from the rules will only be in restricted areas at the doors of the closed.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and media.
The Madridians can therefore meet Manchester City on August 7 without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2 to 1 in the duel after losing in Santiago Bernabea on February 26.
The winning team will be forwarded to the eight-man finals that take place in Portugal.
The Land of Commercial Weekends
From the news of overwhelming hotels and tent areas, in the smallest south, it is clear that the Iceland has been diligent traveling inland this summer.
At the same time, those who have landed have been very lucky with the weather and the weather supplies of DV in one case, saying that the summer was just plainly said nicely, to at least.
But now it is time for a merchant weekend, which has been the most traveling weekend of the year.
However, compared with other weekends, it is unclear how it will be this year.
For example, a nation’s celebration is sufficient.
The weather, of course, will play a big role, but now it looks like a rainfall in all the land, but especially in the south and southwest.
The weather room predicts rainfall from Thursday evening and at least to Saturday night.
For example, long - term prophecies are not sacred truth here in the northern Atlantic Ocean, and they are likely to change.
In his prophecy on his weather tissue, Blika, the weather scholar beats the son of Einar Sveinbjørn to say that the weekend of traders is declining.
Says he: A peak in the air with associated colds, which often also reaches the surface, leads to the fact that when warmer air from the southwest tries to approach, it is only a low level of wind and rain.
Of course, a warmer air that is “fucking ” in the north too.
Einar’s prophetic map is published in support of his prophecy, saying: “A small waves from America flow to the east and with it a summer - warm air.
As it approaches, it “blooms ” in the form of decreasing air pressure and considerate summers. ”
The big prediction, the European calculator to the left of the map, and the United States GFS predictions to the right are quite consistent with this development.
Describing the lowness, the prediction takes place late on Thursday and early on Friday with sharp A and raining on most of the country.
The base centre is approximately 985 hPa followed.
This time, a rather warm air comes in the North and Eastern countries on Saturday and even Sunday.
On the other hand, it could be blown along.

Followed an actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
“I was in love with her as if you had such a childhood shot, ” says Birna Rönn Björndóttir om Mariska Hargitay, the main actress of the Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so annoyed with the actress that she came to the scene and waited for her for hours just to say hi.
When Birna Kid Bears daughter, owner of the Pink Island Travel Office, looked like many Icelanders on the Law and Order tension program: Special Victims Unit from the ages, she collapsed for the main actress of Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her and the actor's meetings in the show Love Story at Channel 1.
When Birna was a youth herself, at the age of many people who began to develop violent love shots, she did not experience it like her peers because she was struggling to suppress her own teachings.
She pretended to be interested in boys’ or boys’ bands and young temperamental heart cramps from movies, but she did not have it at all.
“ I was cutting out pops and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes it is said that when people come out of the closet, they go through a late period of childhood.
“ We spend our teenage years suppressing these teenage impulses, these shots, and stuff.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just in love with her."
When she was in New York a few years ago, the actress ran on the wire.
One of her best friends, Erling Frighten Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie in that city and got Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga Gudjóns son, to help take it.
“ We were working with 30 bands and spend a lot of time with strangers.
This is a naturally intimate atmosphere when you spend so long time together a day, so it was spoken of everything and nothing."
One day, Birna is a great fan of Mariscan.
One of the women in the band says his friend is familiar with the actress because he was on the footage team.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friends like working with the actress and if Birna can see her.
“ She tells me to stop, she doesn’t know if she can make it happen, ” says Birna.
When the film is finally finished, the group will bowl, and the last time Birna tries to convince the woman to try to get the meeting around.
“ She had had a few glasses and said that she would just make it. ”
A few days later, Birna sent a message to her wife and asked if something is happening.
The woman is not responding, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning she wakes up with a long - term message.
“ I look at the phone and scream over me.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up when he screams, and I say, "I have to take a shower, and I have to make myself fine and go to town."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, the actors and the law and order team were present at a hotel at the Times Square.
“ I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, good luck to you, ” says the message, and Birna quickly dresses up, asking in the reception where the roofs go and takes the lift up to the 45th floor where the group is gathered.
Birna sets up and waits until a woman in her staff comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if she can help.
“ I said I was looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived. ”
When the friend finally arrives, he looks amazed at Bearna and asks how she got all the way to the place and was supposed to be a strict security guard.
Birna explains that she just took the elevator and asked to meet Mariska.
“ Yes, I don’t know.
Sit here," says the friend and Birna.
Beside her, there's an extra player in the shows, and they start talking.
“ I say to him, ‘ I am a fan, but you, ’ ” says Birna.
"I played it like it was the most natural thing in the world."
Time is passing and Birna is waiting.
The actors appear regularly when the break is done, they get talk, and the Birna look around them and look for Mariska, which is nowhere visible.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her he's sorry to leave.
Birna asks him to get in the hands of another employee, and she did not intend to go anywhere immediately.
Wonderfully, the friend accepts it and reaches another employee.
“ He brings one of his friends and says, ‘ This is the woman from Iceland who wants to see Mariska. ’ ”
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend will be running to Birna.
“ He says, ‘ Hurry.
These are unusual situations today, there are journalists with her, so she won't stop.
She's going straight to the car with them, so you have to take a chance and go downstairs and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry."
“Since I look right and lose my face” Birna vomits off and takes the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds about forty wheelchairs, some marked and some not.
However, Mariscan’s wheelhouse does not find it, and then desperateness begins to be squeezed.
“ I feel the bug pouring over me because I had spent half a day on this, but I thought, well, I tried.
That was fun."
Evil keeps Birna back towards the hotel, where she sees through the window the camera crew look at her with compassionate eyes, but apparently Birna failed to perform her project.
Birna accepts fate and it starts raining.
“ I go under a shelter to cover myself for the rain.
Then I look right and I lose my face."
No one but Mariska Hargitay was in the pantyress that she was wearing in the stages and Birna was well - known — but Birna was hardly able to move with a mood.
“ I look at my body and my hands, and now you have to move.
Now you have to go towards her."
The bears do it and make up their minds to dick the actress's shoulder.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I'll just say hello, "Birna recalls.
“ I say I'm from Iceland and a great fan.
She says, "It's so nice to meet you."
The conversation did not go much further, for Mariska’s car is here, and it is whispered at it.
Mariska turns to Birna and says: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
The Birna cherishes the idol, watches the car drive away and then breaks down.
“ I call Erling and Gunna, and they didn’t think it would have worked.
But I was crying of excitement and joy.
I say, 'Yes, I'll meet her. You'll have to see me now.
And we bowled in the water of soda and tequila," says Birna.
She will not regret anything even though she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ It’s like this once in a lifetime, to sacrifice such time and energy to make such things happen.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with Birna Renne Björndaughter in the show Love Story at Channel 1.
The police won't spread the virus.
There is no reason to worry that the corona virus can be transmitted by the police’s alcohol talks.
This is what a police officer in the Central City Police Department says in a conversation with Mbl.is.
For example, there have been indications from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police start to operate, place themselves on a roadway, and let everyone who has a route blow.
The police, however, say that the sanitary is the best thing to do.
“ It’s not really a special mouthpiece, ” says a police officer, “but we recommend cups that people blow into. ”
“Some people want to put their lips on this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, up to a few dozen centimetres. ”
Asking if it's enough distance, a police officer says it is.
If you try to prove positive, the police will use it at a different level.
He has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is used only once.
Abdominal distension: including an ice cream to reduce pain
The relationship to depression is not a coincidence.
Individuals suffering from bowel inflammation, a condition characterised by abdominal pain, cramps, thumb, wind passage, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening of symptoms in the United States of America’s anxiety and depression organizations (ADAA).
“ This is because the colon is partly controlled by the nervous system that responds to stress, ” explains ADAA.
If the skin does not decrease, food intolerance may be involved.
A judge tries to stop the decision that children will be released from the holding of immigrants
In his decision on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee canceled the future time limit by saying that the immigration and customs authorities in the United States do not have to release children unless it is possible by any of the three routes described in its previous decree.
However, Gee also stressed the obligation of the immigration and customs authorities to release children without undue delay in its decree.
The three routes Gee suggested are to release families held by immigrants and customs authorities, put children into the hands of a responsible person, or release families by a federal decision.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of the Agency Proyecto Dilley, who provides families with a legal service, condemned the decision and said she put it into the hands of the immigration and customs authorities to decide whether to keep children in custody.
“The main point is that children are kept untimely and they are not released unless the immigration and customs authorities agree or families agree to be separated, ” said Fluharty.
Families are held in three locations of immigrant and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas, and Karnes County.
The children in these places are between 1 and 17 years of age, according to lawyers and lawyers who provide legal assistance.
In June, Gee, who supervises the implementation of the Flores Agreement on the Care of Childcare, said that, as “the rules on masking and social distance were not or are poorly followed,” it would be important to move children away from these stations.
969 persons in custody of the immigration and customs authorities have been diagnosed with the corona virus and are under isolation or surveillance from 23 July, according to the migrant and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 cases are confirmed in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in family custody centers.
Over 3700 cases have been confirmed in custody
Will review the law on the independence of governments
The Prime Minister noted that pension funds set standards in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
Comments from the administrator of the Banks on the need to ensure the independence of the pension funds, possibly by law, will be taken into consideration.
After Icelandair broke up with the Iceland Airmaids Association and resigned all airmaids, the VR declared that governments appointed by VR in the management of the Living Occupational Commerce Fund, or voted against participation of the Icelandair biosecurity fund in the future stock bid.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of the VR, went on to say that governments would be replaced if they did not respond to the recommendation.
Ragnar Thorr revoked his statement three days later and also the VR government.
On Friday, on RUV's news, Ásgeir Jonsson, the bank manager said that it would be necessary to ensure the independence of the directors of the pension fund in the fund's agreement and possibly by legal change.
Katrín, the daughter of the Prime Minister, says that the governments of the pension fund are independent, but already consider it legally secure.
“ Now, ” she says, “a bank manager, who deals with the financial services involved, has said that if something needs to go over there, we will have to look into the rules of independence in particular, of course, if something needs to be done there. ”
Katrín says that according to the law, pension funds should set moral standards in their investment policy.
It is desirable to discuss the social and moral standards that they want to emphasize in their investments.
“ Likewise, I felt that pension funds also set standards in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
However, I believe that such decisions are made through policy, not through exceptional investment decisions," says Katrín.
“ An intolerant road block at the Alphus Bridge, ” says the President of the City of År
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City of År, says a traffic block that is formed at the Alphus Bridge of Selfossi every day completely intolerant.
He hopes that an invitation for a new bridge over the river Alfus will take place in the fall.
Today, when Iceland is traveling through its country, the roadways of the country are constructed daily by the Alphus Bridge, when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the community.
Long rows form at the edge and can handle the patience of the drivers to wait in order.
“ Yes, it’s totally irritable, it’s one roadblock here and not just on Fridays, because it’s just been in active days too.
There are long queries, sometimes quite up to Hellisheid for those who want to get through here on their way east to the land and those who are coming westward, so it gives us an eye that we need a new bridge and not later than yesterday," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City of Årborg.
Helgi says that the city authorities recently had a meeting with the President of the Road and the Designer of the Road, and that meeting was very positive.
“ If you have ever been optimistic about working on these issues, I think I can say it now because it is really working on this, and we should be able to see that a new bridge will be invited out in the fall. ”
But do any advice have been made to the drivers who are in the queue at the Alphus Bridge all day over the summer season?
“Yes, it is possible to go through the narrows and through the Ear banks, but those who are going east on the side, it cannot be pointed out to them to go the Lyngdal plain, but those who are going up to the hills should use the Mosfells Sheet, the Assembly and the Lyngdal Sheet. ”
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City of År, who says the traffic block, formed at the Alphus Bridge by Selfoss intolerant.
Long requests are formed every day at the Alphus Bridge and often require drivers to wait for a considerable amount of time to cross the bridge.
Then you can only take a deep breath and think something positive.
The Future of North Brisbane’s Coal Bears
In addition to the vital home of the coal bears, squirrels, and the grey squirrel, it was an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Advocates have appealed against the rejection of the City Government to the Court of Justice of Organization and the Environment in order to argue that building is in line with the legislation on urban structures since 2014, would meet the organisational and social needs which have not yet been met and could be carried out without an unacceptable effect.
There is great opposition to these planned projects in the suburbs.
The rapporteurs argue that, despite the fact that the proposal is fully consistent with the organization, it could be changed if it did not meet requirements rather than reject it.
At present, there are many stages, including service stations, childcare facilities, and 39 apartments.
There were more than 120 public submissions at the meeting time, and most of them objected to the proposal because it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The minority leader of Brisbane said that the city had to buy the land to protect the coal bears.
“ Adrian Schrinner has to stop wasting taxpayers ’ finances in the fight against managers in court and buy this country to protect Brisbane’s natural and animal life, ” said City Commissioner Cassidy.
“ This is one of the most important homes of coal bears in the natural area of Mountain to Mangroves, where there is a number of coal bears. ”
Schrinner said this week that the city government wanted to protect the coal bears in the area.
“We felt that the proposal was not suitable for the area, ” Schrinner said.
“I understand that this is going through the judicial system and clearly we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will keep our home. ”
Schrinner said that the map of the local coal bears was the joint responsibility of the city government and that the government was responsible for accurate maps of coal bears’ homes supported by local authorities when they apply for applications for treatment.
Sunshine: Next step is winning something
Ole Gunnar Solskin, Coach Man Utd, was a hoping fighter with the team assured themselves a third place in the English election department today.
The team will therefore be at the European Championship Division in the next period.
The United had to fight Leicester today, and it was the result of the Red Demons' 2 to 0.
“ A great achievement for the players to reach third place according to the situation in the period.
I think we boys might have crossed spiritual clues by winning such a big game, since we've lost twice in the past during this period.
We knew we needed a final today, now we can have the next chapter that these boys have to win titles," said Solskin winning ropes.
Manchester United still has the chance of winning a title during this period, but the team plays in the European Division in August and is almost at the 8-point final there.
Weapons break starts at midnight in war-fighted East Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine — the Ukrainian Army and Resistance Forces in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a “final” cease to begin at midnight and as representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after 6 years of conflict.
On Sunday, representatives of opponents said that they had given their soldiers orders for ceasefire and issued a decree to prohibit the use of weapons.
The Ukrainian army said that their army “have prepared ” for the ceasefire.
If it was achieved, it would “bear the way for the implementation of other provisions” of the Minsk peace treaty, according to the declaration of the office of the President of Ukraine earlier this week, where the ceasefire was called a timely step.
The aim of the Minsk peace treaty, made in 2015 by France and Germany, was to settle the conflict between Ukraine and the apartheid that enjoyed Russia's support, which began in 2014 after Russia's accession to the Crimean Plains and the country's support for apartheid.
More than 14,000 people have died in the battle.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine welcomed both the ceasefire on Sunday and stressed the importance of the agreement reached at the Paris Summit in December.
Vladimir Putín, President of Russia, expressed concern at Kiev’s call for the Minks Convention to be reviewed and said that the view of Mr Selenskij, President of Ukraine, of “the unchangeableness of the Minsk Convention, which he once again expressed in this call, should be reflected in real actions. ”
Selenskij, on the other hand, stressed the need for “more action ” to deliver the Ukrainian prisoners of rebels in Eastern Ukraine, in the limbed-in Crimic and in Russia, according to the President’s office declaring.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only have jurisdiction over borders with Russia in the areas in which the separatists are in power when they have received widespread right of self-control and when elections have been held in the regions.
The convention reduced conflicts, but the Ukrainian Army and the rebels have continued to be armed.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December for other discussions, the Minsk Convention was supported and agreed to resume the peace process.
Selenskij, who won the elections in 2019 with promises of ending the conflict, wanted Ukraine to have jurisdiction over the borders before the first regional checks, but the Kreml government demands that the agreement be implemented without any change.
The new arms suspension agreement was reached on Wednesday by a three-sided group of representatives of Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
At the conventional Sunday anniversary of Peterstorgi, Pope Fran also mentioned the cease of arms and said that it was necessary to “rebuild trust and lay the foundation for the very necessity and long - awaited peace with the people. ”
Police: Man shot to death in protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot to death in protests in Texas when he approached a car and the driver in his car fired his weapon, according to the police.
The police spokesman Katrina Ratliff told journalists early on Sunday that the shooting took place just before 22:00 at the time of a protest in Austin.

According to Capochiano, the man with a rifle approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver drove away, said Capochiano.
Ratliff told journalists that the first news suggested that “the victim may have had a rifle, ” adding that the suspect was in custody and willing to cooperate with the police.
According to the news offices, the group had gathered for the Black Lives Matter conventions on Saturday.
The objection was streamed live on Facebook, where the whistle of the car and a few shots were heard.
Blika’s first victory in July
In a moment, the first division wins from June 29, when the team killed the IA, 5-3, in the Pepsi Max division of men in Copavogs tonight.
On the other hand, poor people lose their third game in a row in the department.
After winning his first three games in the department, Breague played five games without celebrating victory and had lost three in a row for the IA game tonight.
So it was working or dying for Blika, who came to play with great effort.
Alexander Helgi, the Victory Son, led the team with a fine delivery in the 11th minute after Christen Steindor’s son had sent him through the IA defense.
Six minutes later, Kristin doubled the lead after the very fine preparation of Gisla Eyjulf’s son on the left side.
In the first half - game, the blackheads could not reach land and beaches, where the local high - pressures made them difficult to tie transmissions together.
In the 36th minute of Daninn Thomas Mikkelsen, all the rulers of the field were harvesting the third mark in the corner of Höskuldar Gunnlaug's son.
Then Christian Steindor’s son scored his second mark and the fourth mark Blika just three minutes later.
However, the story of the first half - game did not end there.
For the second time, the Saxon Ravn Haraldsson scored a wattage shortly before the break, but Kwame Quee had then broken Viktori, son of John, in the midst of Blika.
Therefore, 4-1 was the situation for a moment when the semi-fifty flare was defected.
Only three minutes had passed from the second half of the game when the Scarlets scored again.
By then, the Hlyn of Savar Jonsson was alone and displaced on the market Blika and easily guided the ball to the net by the corner of Tryggva, Harald’s son.
However, only three minutes later, when IA broke Alexander Helga, a fracture occurred within the ignorance of IA.
Whitspy was convicted, and Thomas Mikkelsen challenged safety to bring over a moment of 5-2 after only seven minutes of the second half.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's mark, the Shakes scored again.
Anton Ari Einarsson, a target watchman Blika, then came under a pressure from Viktori John’s son, put the ball in Viktor’s foot, from which the ball refused on the Internet.
Unbelievable 5-3 positions were observed after less than ten minutes of later half-play, which slowed down to the target challenge.
Despite a fine chance for both teams to add to the line, including the two deaths of Kwame Quee from the Break, they did not become more and the 5–3 victory of the Break moment final.
In a moment, the first triumph was won in just a month, from June 29th, and it has passed after the victory with 14 points in third place, two points from Val above, and three points from KR top.
However, KR and Valur are both involved in Blika.
The IA has to accept the third loss in a row in the division, but the team has ten points in eighth, five points from the defeat.
The puppy's not in danger despite the White House's comments
The breeders of the Puppy Team were right yesterday not to stop showing the child material in the near future.
The statement follows Kayleigh McEnany, a press representative of the White House, that the elements involved in the field of police dogs are victims of “extinguishing culture. ”
The Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnany’s words and stated that their fans had no need to worry about the future of the Puppy squad.
A number of television seramons dealing with police work have been taken out of a show in the United States lately following protest against police violence.
The puppy band, however, is not among them, despite the reputation of this subject on social media.
On Friday, at a press meeting in the White House, McEnany said that President Trump was opposed to “infiltrative culture, ” especially when it came to the police.
The term refers to the fact that the comments or actions of individuals or firms raise a severe reaction on social media and is called after the object is dismissed in the objection.
“ We saw it a few weeks ago when the puppy squad show, a child - dealing drug for cops, was stopped.
The same is true of the show Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego took a police set from the market, but there is no foothold for that claim, according to Lego’s defense officers.
However, it is true that the realities of the Cops and the Live PD have recently been removed from the Western Sea.
Both stages are controversial for showing videos of real police work without the permission of individuals present there.
Together for 29 years — Sometimes jealousy and suspicion arise
Christian Thomas ’ daughter, a family treater, answers a reader’s questions about family, children, and love in the family corner of DV.
At this time, she will respond to readers who have never been single.
We've been together since we were 15. We've been together for 29 years and have two children.
We know nothing but to be together and feel good, but we both feel like we're missing something.
We have never been with other people, and we have no comparison of how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust when it comes to whether the other person is looking around, thinking about adultery, or even divorce, and changing.
When we discuss this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is such a pain that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a great question and I am so glad that you have such open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in relation to your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking this in each corner, you couldn't talk about this and even take some steps that you could later regret.
Everything on board, isn't it always the best?
A strong self - image has the most predictive of happiness in the future and the stronger self - imagination you have, the more likely you will be to have a mate with a strong self - image.
The fact that relationships that start in adolescents do not last all their lives is often that people are maturing in each direction, but in those cases where they become effective, individuals can become stronger than many others.
Since your relationship begins to develop during your greatest years of forming, it can be concluded that you have matured together and have a positive influence on each other’s self - image.
For example, we are molded by our relationships.
The way I talk, it's shaped by how you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relations shape who we are.
Would you turn the example back and think, ‘ What do we have that others do not have? ’
What does this many years of speciality give us?
I may claim that the advantages can be quite more than the defects.
You have formed each other for years, and as a result, you are customized up to millimeters of each other.
That is more than many can say.
That's worth it?
You say that you have missed something, but it is important to remind yourself that big changes, such as divorce and new relationships, also follow compliments that you are not necessarily excited about.
You may be missing out on starting up again, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and setting up families.
These include new challenges, different problems, and potentially something new and exciting.
But this does not just follow a pink cloud and happiness, no, at your age, this can become a messy job, which could possibly never smash as well as you have already done to each other.
Is it worth it?
Rather, why not focus on what you can do to increase excitement, unforeseenness, and innovations in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on the shelf yet.
There are so many things you can do to deepen your long relationship.
What experiments can you make in this regard?
What do you need from your mate that you are not getting?
What can you give to your mate that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and re-define your relationship.
Would you like to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, there is a considerable greater tolerance for various forms of relationship, and couples are now defining their relationships in various ways, such as open relationships, multiflashes, or deciding to temporarily discontinue.
I am not telling you what to do, even though no expert in your solutions, but possibly it would relieve this heavy fat that awaits you, if you face this matter and think in solutions.
What need you for such distrust and fear to disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, that must mean you're capable of things together.
Use it as strength and hold hands towards your solution.
We urge readers to send their questions and speculations to Christian by email at: marriage salesela@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in the Family Corner, of course anonymous and in full confidentiality.

Coleen Rooney decrees Johnny Depp's lawyer in the Wagatha Christie rim of Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against the charges of injury against Rebekah Vardy
After conversations between the soccer mate, their acquaintances expect a dramatic treaty
Coleen Rooney has hired the star lawyer in Johnny Depp's prosecution to defend himself in the so-called "Wagatha Christie" issue with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday emits that Rooney has given David Sherborne the task of defending herself against the accusation that she was injured against Vardy, claiming that personal data was leaked to the media by its closed Instagram access.
A few days after data were submitted to the Supreme Court, the report states that Rebekah Vardy, married to the soccer Jamie Vardy of the Leicester City football team, suffered physically and spiritually from Coleen Rooney’s claims.
The magazine reports that the 38 - year - old mother, five children, “has had severe shocks and anxieties, so she was afraid to leave the house ” and that Vardy, who was seven months on the way,“ had three times been hospitalized... because of anxieties caused by the entry and its consequences. ”
In addition to being a lawyer of Depp in his injurious case against The Sun, because of claims that the actor beat his wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, goes with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their private case against Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After negotiation between the two two football partners, those who are familiar with dramatic discrimination in the courtroom are expected to fail.
“ If you felt the Depp trial, don’t underestimate the prospective war of the football partners, ” said one source.
“ Now this is a real war, and Coleen is not giving in, nor Becky, and it will be emotionally intense. ”
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used the Instagram access of Rebekah Vardy would have leaked up a story about it to the newspaper.
She was named "Wagatha Christie" after clarifying how she spent five months in slowly limiting the number of friends who could see updates on Instagram stories, until only the account of Vardy was left.
Coleen claims that he had set up a false story on Instagram, which had then appeared in a gossip magazine.
In Vardy’s papers, which refuse to participate in the case, she claims that it was made a blunder after Rooney published the accusations “in a deliberate manner, aiming at causing great harm and tremendous suffering. ”
Coleen’s lawyers have questioned these words and say that claims about her suffering are merely presented to the media and distract the attention from the facts.
A source said: “The documents from Becky are misleading, it’s all inventory. ”
It is the lawyer Paul Lunt at Brabner’s legal office in Liverpool, who deals with Coleen Rooney, who has four sons with the former England champion Wayne Rooney.
Vardy's at Kingsley Napley, London, she's not sure she's hired a lawyer yet.
The spokesman Coleen Rooney refused to interview.
Bidens campaign team refuses “Fox News Sunday” for an interview one week after Chris Wallace interview with Trump
In Trump's interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump doubted that the future presidential Democrat, Joe Biden, would control the questionnaire that Wallace dropped on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least not at the moment.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audience that the Bidens campaign team had told Fox News that he was "not free" for an interview.
“ In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his adversary in the Democratic group, Joe Biden, would flourish in similar circumstances, ” said Wallace.
“ During the week, Biden’s election team asked for an interview and they said that the former Vice President was not free. ”
“ We keep asking each week, ” he added.
For months, Trump’s campaign team has criticized Biden for avoiding election meetings and press conferences while attending interviews during the crown virus epidemic.
Although Biden recently started his campaign again, Trump and his companions have continued to mock the ex-president for “hiding ” at his home in Delaware.
However, the discouragement of Bidens to attend public events has not damaged his offer, since recent surveys show that Biden has a good precedent for Trump both nationally and in major war countries.
Means of Real Clear Politics indicate that the president was 7 percent below in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four states in 2016 when he turned them over to the Republican party when he won the fight for the White House.
In the recent Fox News Poll survey, Biden has a headline in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, in all cases.
The surveys also suggest that Biden had a little precedent in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important countries in these elections.
And the surveys indicate that formerly trusted states, such as Texas and Georgia, now divide between Trumps and the former vice president.
Presidential elections in the White House are often voting on that president — and this seems to be the case now in 2020 in the battle between Trumps and Bidens.
The most important topics have been the crown virus and the economy that is low because of the epidemic — as well as the performance and history of the president in both cases.
Kanye West and his wrestling with the moods
Today, the musician Kanye West apologized for his wife, Kim Kardashian, for his speeches that he put in the mood of humiliation.
The president of Psychiatrics believes that he is getting his creative power in the mood, but a psychiatrist suggests that people take medicines to control the disease.
The rapper Kanye West is not just one of the most original and most powerful musicians of the time, but he is even as famous as the husband of the realist act star Kim Kardashian.
His personal life has been largely open.
When he announced earlier this month that he seemed to offer himself to a president in the United States, he gave an emotionally depressed speech.
Later, on Twitter, he appeared a strange prick, claiming that his wife was trying to put him in hospital.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram where she asked people to understand her husband and family; he had bipolar disorder; and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not seek help.
Since then, he has apologized publicly to her.
This famous family is not the only one who faces this problem.
Approximately one percent of people have mental reactions.
Ferdinand Jonsson, a psychiatrist in London, knows the disease well.
“ This disease can make individuals, especially their families and their loved ones, so uncomfortable.
This pride or mania can destroy relationships and work and cause a tremendous grief.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often extremely dangerous, because there's a high rate of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was beautiful that she said that.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
Unnsteinsson, Chairman of Psychiatrics, has himself wrestled with psychiatrists — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very fierce imagination.
If we are four strings of earthly counterbass, he is a hundred strings of heavenly harp.
And he's so overly creative, overly powerful, and clearly in his powerful connection thought, because you'll be aware of this connection thought that we who've been given to try it to be in a state of humiliation know so well."
Kanye West does not want to take antipsychotics, because he believes that they reduce his creativity.
He's been discussing the moods, including the Ye record.
The book says that it is his choice not to take medicines.
“ Many people feel that it holds this creative element that is involved in this unrelenting thought of connection and the superb creative power of the fire he has, but so are naturally the defects of it often great suffering, and the centuries and dark basements and darkness. ”
Ferdinand, however, says that it is important that people with bipolar disorder are treated.
“ If you have a lot of pride or mania, you don’t make anything wonderful, you’re just on the side.
And as when people get into severe depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medicines?
“ Certainly, ” says Ferdinand.
“And in particular to work with someone to find the right doses and this way to make balance between the most helpful of the medications, destroying as little as he and his talents and his creative power. ”

Delhi Metro casts the first pillar at the fourth stage of implementation
Delhi Metro reached an important fourth stage of implementation when the first pillar was cast on the road between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, which is being placed, according to staff on Sunday.
The pillar was cast into Keshopur and on an elevated part between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.
“Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) stepped another important step at the fourth stage of the implementation when the first pillar at this stage of the expansion of the train system was steeped for the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, ” stated DMRC.
This “important implementation phase” was achieved despite a considerable lack of labour and other organisational challenges caused by the pandemic, according to staff.
The average height of the pillars on this way is 10 meters.
On the other hand, the pillars will be 20 meters high at Madhuban Chowk, where the route crosses 1 and 25 meters near Haiderpur Badli Mother, where the route reaches 2.
With Haiderpur Badli Mother, the bridge road will be 28 meters high, the highest height of Dehli Metro’s history, as stated in the statement.
The highest point of the train system is at Dhaula Kuan, where a bridge road leads 7 to a height of 23.6 meters.
In the context of construction engineering, pillars are vertical pressured works that support the adjacent end of two paths.
They form vertical works that carry up the elevated bridge roads of the train system.
This can be seen on the countless highways under the Deli railroads.
The number of the pillars now plays an important role in identifying the addresses of the Deli city area.
The 28.92 km long way from Janakpuri West to R K Ahsram Marg is an expansion on the Magenta route and will be 22 stations on it.
21.18 km of the road will be raised and 7.74 km will be underground.
Construction of this section began in December last year.
On July 17, work began in the subterritorial section of the road when the construction of a crawling wall at the Krishna Park Extension train station began.
On 24 June, DMRC began to pour out U-barbits that would later be placed in an elevated part of the route.
At the fourth stage of the project, 61,679 km of new trains will be placed for three different routes by 45 train stations.
These new parts will provide connections between the parts of the train system that Delhi Metro already operates.
Of them, 22.35 miles below the ground, and other parts are raised.

Ambassador called for a gun, a armored car, and a sticking vest - said submen to be the ambassador of “the Deep Kingdom ”
The political ambassador of the United States here in the country, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is said to want to carry firearms on in the CBS news story today.
Starting news of CBS, “Despite being located in one of the safest states in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is“ paranoid ” about his safety since his arrival in Reykjavík last year. ”
Points CBS to 12 diplomats, government and former representatives, as well as individuals who know the case.
Gunter’s conclusion was to demand from the U.S. Department that they requested permission for the ambassador paranoid to walk around armed here on the land.
He was also supposed to have requested a armored car that traveled with him between places in Iceland and a sticking vest.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to state whether any threat caused the security of the ambassador, but the representatives of the U.S. government said that the ambassador was told that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
Yet, according to CBS, lifeguards would have been advertised by the Ambassador’s demands.
CBS reports that the Iceland Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to express itself to CBS.
However, the U.S. news agency has reported its sources here in the country that there was no wish for the national governments to receive that material.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of walking around armed as it would offend the Kingdom of Iceland.
The ambassador received his nobles for supporting Donald Trump's elections in the 2016 presidential elections.
Earlier, he was a dermatologist in California.
Since Gunter took over in Mai when he said that he had created an “impossible ” occupational environment in the Embassy, and he has already had seven subscribers, called Deputy Chief of Mission, subscribers of the ambassador, who are also diplomas.
That was all experienced diplomats from the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The first one was sent away by the ambassador “because he did not like his appearance. ”
He had already prepared for a year and learned Icelandic.
The next one lasted only six months.
Afterward, the people were created to rotate, and the thought was to allow Gunter to act as much as he could until he liked one of them.
Furthermore, CBS says that Gunter expected the staff of the Embassy to go to the “deep state ” and to have undermined him with regard to the Foreign Ministry of Washington D.C.
The Heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in D.C. are well aware of the situation of their ambassador in Reykjavik, but have been hesitant to rely on the control of the ambassador’s anarchy in view of Gunter’s connection with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had difficulty following the orders of the State Department in Washington, and he is said to have refused to return to D.C. while the Covid-19 epidemic was taking place.
He left the embassy in the hands of his staff for several months.
When he was told to work from his home in California, except by the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Turning Finally Back
Having finally received the order, Gunter would return to Iceland in May.
His new subordinate, Michelle Yerkin, came to the land this month.
CBS has not received any answers to their requests to the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not wish to communicate with CBS, nor did the DV request.
Gunter is one of a number of politically appointed ambassadors of the Trump government who has drawn attention to unusual behavior during the last few months.
For one thing, when the day came, Woody Johnson was trying to move a British opening golf championship to a golf field owned by Trump.
The ambassador in South Africa has also been accused of running out his number two and then trying to put her son in the job.
42% of the U.S. Ambassador is politically appointed.
30% were politically appointed to Obama's government, and 32% in George W. Bush's government.

Poland will report on the European Convention on the Prevention of Violence against Women
According to the Polish right government, the country will withdraw from the European treaty to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul treaty is the first binding legal act in the world, which aims to prevent violence against women, but the Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro describes the text as “harmful ” in which he demands that schools teach children about sex from a social point of view.
Ziobro said about the weekend that on Monday he would start preparing a formal process for the country to report the contract.
“This theoretical factor is related to attempts to change education in schools and leisure work, as regards study, attitude and conviction of the younger generation of Polish, based on the conclusion that we consider to be wrong, that biological sex is old-fashioned and that everything is really about social culture.”
Ziobro considers that the law on education and training of children and young people and family relations in the context of LGBTs is unacceptable.
“We also reject the LGBT feature in the discussion on family affairs, because this is an opinion held up by left activists or groups of homosexuals who want their opinions to become binding law, ” he said.
On Sunday, the European Council said that it was “surprising ” because Poland was confronted with the contract.
On Friday in Warszawa, about 2,000 people, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, protested outside the offices of the right - hand organization, Ordo Luris, who supports the country’s declaring the contract.
“ We will not be victims, ” they called them.
Protests also took place in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul treaty on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and validated it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, engineer in Honor Palace, dead 81 years old
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, a part of a quartz - mile - drive empire that counts his father Lee and his brother Richard, who was the first engineer taken into Nascar’s Honorary Hall, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While his other family members were commended for their abilities behind the steering wheel, Maurice Petty entered the nickname “The Boss ” for his skills with the switch key.
He helped his family to win 198 race races and seven titles in NASCAR, and he also built machines that secured the victory of Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton.
“ The manager was one of the most prominent engineers in the history of NASCAR, ” said the Chairman and manager Jim France.
“ He brought the power that helped Petty Enterprises to achieve their superiority in the sports field.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also played various roles behind the tents and did what was necessary to get his cars on the winning track."
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939 in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the raceway when he was small, and his engineering knowledge soon became a major factor in the winning of Lee Petty in 54 races and three champions.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR cup between 1960 and 64, seven times in the top five seats and 16 times in the top ten.
Soon, however, he decided to focus on what would happen under the engine shield rather than behind the steering wheel, which proved to be fascinating for his older brother, who relied on his machines during his triumph.
Richard, then called “The King, ” won the first championship title along with the Commander in 1964 with a Plymouth car.
Again, in 1967, two years in a row in 1970 and 1971, they won three more titles before the end of the 1970 ’ s.
With these seven titles on their back, they share the record in most titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“ Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and was involved in the process of Petty Enterprises in building one of the top members of NASCAR, ” said Winston Kelley in a statement.
“ Although Petty’s winners are recorded as 212, he is entitled to over 250 wins if he is taken with all the machines he constructed for his competitors.
The boss will be remembered forever as one of the best machinemakers in the history of NASCAR."
Lee Petty died in 2000, and Patricia, Maurice Petty’s wife of 52 years, died in 2014.
He was also the cousin of the former driver and of the mediaman Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, Lieutenant in the car race.
“ Although we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and skillful pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his heritage and name will be kept in our memory, kept up and preserved forever, ” Kelley said.
“We send our deepest sympathy to the Petty family. ”

Armies destroy camps, and slay men of war in the kingdom of Zamfara;

Serbia wants to increase the number of military planes in the growing tension of the Balkans
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its army and seek to buy more military aircraft for the tension of the Balkans, said the president of Serbia on Sunday.
Aleksandar Vucic said that “some deliberations ” were under way to buy a fleet of battleplanes, accusing the United States and other Western states of arming Serbia’s neighbouring countries in NATO, as well as Kosovo, formerly provinced in Serbia.
“ The Americans, Turks, and Germans take good care of their beloved offspring, ” said Vucic, referring to Kosovo.
He said that the United States had recently delivered the Kosovo security troops a number of armored cars.
In a view of the Serbian Army Army, Vucic said that his people could not compete with “Nato’s contributions ” to the arms forces of their neighbors and that“ that’s why we’re up to ourselves. ”
While Vucic did not specify the type of Serbian military planes that were buying, the media claims that his government officially requested the delivery of 20 attack planes from the United States.
It appears that Washington did not receive an answer to the request from Belgrade and that it is likely that attack aircraft of the type Sukhoi-25 from Russia will be purchased.
Serbia, proposing a military neutrality policy, has recently received a highly developed air - protection system from Russia, which has also provided fighters, attack helicopters, and armored vehicles.
China, also a Serbian Alliance, has delivered the government to use in warfare.
U.S. officials have discussed openly the launch of serbic penalties if more weapons are transferred to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could endanger the safety of neighbouring NATO states.
In the western and neighboring countries of Serbia, people see the panic of Russian and Chinese arms in Serbia.
The tension now increases on the Balkans, where civil wars in the 1990 ’ s resulted.
The Atlantic Alliance intervened with Serbia to stop Serb bloody actions against Cosovo-Albana separators in 1999.
Despite formal efforts to join the European Union, Serbia's popist leader has further strengthened its political and military relationship with Kreml and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, do not recognize the independence of Kosovo, which has been acknowledged by the United States and most Western countries.
Heart attack: The likelihood of this fatal condition may be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that certain goodness may be good for the heart muscle.
And how could this reduce the chance of a heart attack?
Scientists have analysed coronary artery disease for over 50 years.
The main symptoms of coronary artery disease (also called ischaemic heart disease) are three: chest pain (angina), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include palpitations and severe shortness of breath.
“Succulation contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoide, methylxanthin, polyphenol and steric acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also called high - concentration lipoprotein, accumulates poor cholesterol – a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart – and transfers it to the liver.
The poor cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein) is broken down in the liver and then separated from the body.
However, the new study does not investigate the dose or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not known whether participants ate dark chocolate, milk sugar, or other chocolate.
The findings were based on an older study that concluded that the consumption of cocoa (covered in chocolate) reduced the likelihood of heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Vascular function refers to how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients through the body and transfers waste away.
Lifestyle factors were not mentioned in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the evidence that those who admitted to eating chocolate would be more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added, then, that they could practice regular exercise and experience less stress.
“Each of these factors could affect the health of the cardiovascular system independently, ” she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys with books in a new collection campaign
“ We have really listened, ” Ronson said, “and that was a key factor in preparing a project. ”
“ We do not believe that people want to recycle the books — we think they will want them, but they can recycle them at their home if they want. ”
Ronson said that the new campaign had been underway long before COVID-19 came into existence, and despite the epidemic, it believes that the timing of the new campaign was “some good ” because of how much time parents spend now spend with their children.
While analysts have expressed concern for the fact that consumers have become tired of the ever - growing toy collection campaigns of the largest supermarket, Ronson says that no sign of fatigue is still available.
“ We haven’t seen anything like that yet, ” she said, “but we keep our eyes open to this. ”
“ We analyze a lot of data, from week to week, month to month, to make sure that what we surrender is in harmony with our clients.
It was Cloes who paved the track for the collection campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first of my year 2018 was the driving force behind the best quarter sales of the supermarket from the beginning.
Woolworths followed with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the supermarket to expand their sales, and now last time offers the environmentally friendly campaign Discovery Garden customers up to free plants and flowers for planting.
However, the new collection campaign could have less effect this time, since UBS analysts predict increased sales in Australia’s supermarkets in the majority of the 2021 financial year.
Ronson said that clients can expect more future collection campaigns and that campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to become less likely.
“ There is a lot of collection campaigns around the world that we look at and we are constantly inspired from other countries, ” she said.
“ We need to do this to make sure that we’re doing more and more with our customers. ”
It's been five rounds around the country this summer.
The photographer and the material producer John Ragnar Johnsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, reminds us of a traveling trip around Iceland since the pandemic.
John completed a business study at the University of Reykjavik a few years ago, but he is now working on travelling and producing products for individuals and companies.
The summer began early with John, or in April, when he traveled throughout the West and stayed in his car.
In the end of a year, he has gone about five or six circles around the country.
Besides, he's been on countless day trips here and there.
What trip has come up from?
“ For someone like me who's always on the road and who's seen everything, it's hard to name a favorite place.
It's more the weather and the company that matters.
Recently, after opening the roads in June, they have traveled highways.
Those trips always stand up, for it's such an adventure to get to their destination.
The last trip there is the possible favorite journey of the year, but then we went 25 together in 5 large cars up by Riverside and from there to river water."
What is ahead of you this summer?
“ I’m very excited about time, but I was just finishing my diving course with DIVE and now taking diving trips around Iceland.
Then I was just adding a surfboard to my "dope" so I'll be more into the sea than I've been before.
I am heading for a 10 - day “solo ” journey with everything I need my back, but later this summer, where I go.
Otherwise, I'm going to be a lot of highlands in the near future, since there's no way to check that area all year."
What is your favorite place in Iceland?
“ It’s always hard to choose a place, but the Earl of Jack has been a part of my life since I remember.
My family and I went every summer to a dwelling place at the roots of Breamerkjölk, and since then I’ve always had a good time in that area.
I think I'm safe to say I've been there over 100 times."
With what place in Iceland do you recommend visiting people?
“ I’m going to bring one pearl from every part of the country, but it’s: Molecules in the South, the East, the Aldea Falls in the North, the Red Assemblies in the West, the Snæfellsjökull in the West, and last but not the last...
What is essential for the trip?
“ I don’t go to the land unless I have the following in my car: good pocket lights, hanging room, lopapies, hunting knives, nuts, chicken boxes, and beetles... those who know me know what I’m talking about. ”
Searching for 24 rodents fearing drowning from an island in Malaysia
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — The Malaysia authorities said on Sunday that 25 refugees who feared to have drowned after jumping off a boat from the tourist island Langkawi, north of Malasia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high - ranked official of Malasia’s sanctuary, said that the first information from the police showed that only one of the 25 rodents jumped off the boat had reached ashore.
The man who survived, according to Zawawi, sought help from a police officer late on Saturday and has been held in custody during further investigation.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslims have fled Myanmar for military operations, and many of them live in overwhelming refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of Malaysia’s people, who have been the frequent destination of boats that promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and airplanes were used for the search.
He said that the landcare will also alert seafarers in the area and the authorities in the neighboring Thailand so that they can help with the search.
He didn't give any more information about the boat.
Last month, the authorities in Malaysia held 269 refugees in custody and found a body on board a boat suspected of being used for smuggling off the coasts of Langkawi, who claimed he was deliberately damaged so that he could not return to sea.
Later, Malaysia’s sanctuary reported that the 269 individuals were transferred from a larger ship with dozens of people who were thought to have died and their bodies were thrown into the sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that Malasia could not take over any more refugees, as it struggles with economic conditions because of the corona virus epidemic.
He said, however, that those already in the country would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live in addition to about 180,000 refugees and refugees — including 101,000 rodents — registered at the United Nations Refugee Agency.
Inhabitants of Aswan collect, watch, and return a cargo of chocolate to Sudan by car
A transport car on the way to Sudan with many tons of chocolate on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the street conventions of the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell into a coma because of temperature.
The villagers grouped to help the driver where he was lying and to save the oily goods.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, expressed his position so that the driver “was walking past our village; we could not just pass by.
We're supposed to help people in distress, no matter where they come from."
He added that the villagers came for an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the transport car, which is estimated to be three million U.S. Pounds.
Bahr said the villagers were on the scene from morning to evening and saved as much of the cargo as they could.
“ What we thought most important was saving the driver’s life, protecting the cargo, and reopening the international road, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the injured driver with water and shelter, said Bahr, and added that they wanted to make sure that he could get to and from the village safe.
The corona virus could make them worse.
“ The world epidemic alone calls on our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we expect in times of trouble, ” says a report prepared by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communications at the American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“ But we are also faced with other debts that relate to the inherited sin of our nation and the racial inequalities that have plagued our country since its establishment. ”
The study examines familiar material related to the pitying state of the congress: the lack of real relationship between categories, a program limiting the opportunities for communication, too much integration of the power of leaders, continuous financial requirements, estimates of cooperation between categories, the negative impact of the media operating throughout the day, the fact that the most important elections for Parliament are often precollections, and finally the silence of minority groups.
It also warns that the Congress is moving more into a network world because of the pandemic, where such a system that allows elections with the help of surrogates in a representative department without the need to travel to Washington could add to the problems that exist.
If the idea of a distant meeting is closer to foothold, it would be a serious relapse for attempts to increase inter-group communication, as the report says.
“ For the sake of the world epidemic, the Senate was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet, and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
“ But even though it was necessary, it should not be interpreted as virtue. ”
The paper says that the Congress needs “more than less communication between parliaments, face to face. ”
They need to learn more about each other's districts, have polite conversations to find common areas and build links based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
The call for politeness was especially true during the week when Ted Yoho, a member of the Republic of Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic Senator from New York, with his fellow members in the Rebubububolic group, assaulting Liz Cheney, a hostile representative of the Republic of Wyoming.
Congressman Val Demings discusses the Vice-President's office, let Trump hear it for grace.
Congressman Val Demings (democrats, Florida) was not shy about discussing their interest in the office of Vice President of Joe Biden’s potential government and expressing sincere gratitude for being taken into account for the office.
This respected member of the Black Group was interviewed with BlackPressUSA on direct broadcast because of the #FIYAH! Live Series, and told about her story, activity, and commitment that has brought her to the place she is today, and started with the words “You know all my story, and I grew up as the daughter of a worker and guardian in Jacksonville, Florida. ”
Demings was one of the four prosecutors of the Deputy Congress in the trial of Donald Trump in the Senate in January.
Regardless of whether the Senate indicts Trump, it will be recorded in the story that he is the fourth President who is accused.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, the former prosecutor of the Assembly of Prosecutors said: “Was it worth it?
She added that despite the disappointment of the decision, the Democrats had been obliged to follow the case after any outcome.
In the interview, Demings made it clear that it is against the pardon of Trump for Roger Stone’s prison sentence, who was convicted of lying before the Congress (in addition to other crimes) as well as his pardon for other criminals who were sentenced for similar crimes, when she said: “The lack of sanctions to accommodate your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover up your iniquity. ”
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden’s list of potential candidates for Vice Presidents, which also holds CBC President Karen Bass (democrats, California), Stacey Abram’s former Georgian Congressman, the Chamela Harris (democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (democrats, Illinois), the Mayor Keisha Lance Bottom of Atlanta, the former Ambassador Susan Rice and several others.
However, she stated that only one person would decide who would offer Joe Biden this fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she moved her hand to her mouth while she laughed and pretended to whisper to those who watched the direct broadcast, adding: “If you want to call... you can do it for me. ”
There is no doubt that regardless of political views, history books will consider this period as a time when American politics and attitudes developed.
The Demings didn't miss it.
She pointed out that the number of women who can be offered to the Vice President of the United States is an opportunity to break through the rest of the “glass roof ” — especially for women of African origin.
“ It’s exactly these opportunities that I’m working so hard on all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money, or that they’re of the wrong kind, ” she said.
The Congresswoman decided to ensure that the National Committee of the Democrats and the Biden election team would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many to vote as possible.
“I will call Tom Perez (president of the National Committee of the Democrats) and I will put this at the top of my list, ” promised Demings.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the campaign.
When she replied to the words of former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost his elections, and another editorial that says that the president is preparing to recover himself lived over Demings: “As much as suggests to make myself feel sick. ”
“ But who would ever do that but Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It is not to be possible to escape from breaking the law and ignore the Constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he can't stand losing.
I can believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to handle it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those who make it happen."
Bottles per foot for children
There are bottles for children who want to drink to their parents from young ages in bottles that fit the table in better days.
No doubt there are now some parents who rejoice — or those parents who have been bored with childish artwork.
Even so, children are the ones who seek the glasses of their parents, for they are more thrilled to see on their feet.
These discussed glasses we hit on the modernhouseessentials.com page, which contains various golden moles.
The bottles have a good stump, a stable leg and a good heat - so kids can enjoy the soup whether it's hot or cold.
Each bottle contains approximately 150 ml.
Those who want to look into the glasses can look into the homepage of this, but the glasses are on the offer of these days in a small amount of dollars.
Alibaba and Jack Ma are brought to trial in Gurugram for the deputy of the former staff.
Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been brought to court in Gurugram after claiming that his former company staff had been fired for protesting the audits and false news in the company’s programs.
The case is addressed in Gurugram District Judgment and Sonia Sheokand, a private judiciary, has issued a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and more than 10 others, asking them to come to trial on July 29, according to news.
The judge has also requested written replies from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who served at UC Web’s office in Gurugram until October 2017, is charged with 268,000 U.S.A. for damages according to legal documents.
“We are in line with the company’s commitment to the Indian market and the welfare of its employees, and its policies are in line with the applicable law.
We cannot express ourselves on the present case," UC India said in a statement.
“ In the prosecution, ” Reuters says, “there is also a list of “sensitive words ” containing passwords in hindi and English such as “the borders of India and China” and“the war between China and India, ” which is alleged to use the UC Web to write material on its systems in India. ”
Last month, the Ministry of the Interior banned 59 Chinese cell phone programs, including UC News and UC Browser, as a result of increased tension between the two countries.
A representative of the firefighter of New York City says it's "absolutely" okay to exclude a white firefighter from an honourable man.
A representative who deals with the diversity of the firefighter in New York says it's "absolutely" okay to keep a white firefighter away from the honour so that flagberries can all be black, according to new news.
The White Fireman Daniel McWilliams has appealed for racial discrimination after he was removed from a group of flagberries at the Memorial Mass in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, a brotherhood of black firefighters.
The chief representative of firefighters in the field of diversity and access, lawyer Cecilia Loving, also defended the decision in the hearing of the New York State Human Rights Department, according to the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters in a historic picture who are seen lifting the American flag at Ground Zero on the days after the 11th September attacks.
According to McWilliam's attorney, the firefighter department had chosen him to be alone in the flagberries at the memorial.
To be a flagber at this ceremony was “a great honor and privilege ” for McWilliam, as stated in the CNN prosecutor.
When he arrived at the ceremony, however, he was refused to participate in the honor of the then Vulcan President, Regina Wilson, for as it is alleged, she had asked that all flagberries at the Mass be black.
She then asked McWilliams – a 29 - year - old firefighter in New York City – to help in another way. ”
Among those claimed to have asked him to do, it is to escort unchanged civilians and to set aside brandmen with a characteristic suit from the Mass.
McWilliams claims in his application that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the honour because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was, he said.
Wilson, who has been in New York Firefight for 21 years and also participated in the rescue work on September 11, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Company.
McWilliams claims that he abandoned the Memorial “to spare himself for further shame, humiliation, and shame, ” when friends and colleagues heard the things that broke between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When the black Loving witnessed in court, McWilliam’s lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked her: “So asking for everyone to be honorable is not discrimination? ”
“No, it’s not, ” said Loving, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it would be all right to ask that everyone be in honour, which she replied, “Absolutely. ”
Loving explained that it would be all right to replace a white person with a black person to “create our specialities and our different origins to create pride, solidarity, and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first filed a complaint on the discrimination of the New York Fire Department in January 2018.
He then appealed against Wilson, the firefighter of New York City, New York City, and unnamed persons in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliam’s prosecuting, Wilson’s supporters have avenged and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have struck McWilliams and said: “I have heard of you, they told me that you would behave like this, and now you know who I am. ”
In a cartoon, Sullivan wrote that it would have been “harmful ” to exclude McWilliam from honor at the Mass and a sign that one was not applicable to all of the firefighters.
“ If you are a black person and discriminating against a white person at work, ” Sullivan said, “you are mostly reminded. ”
Wilson, according to the Appeal Appeal, received a “advice for one hour” for her treatment with McWilliam.
Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a black person receives “a severe punishment, ” wrote Sullivan.
“The firefighter of New York City has created a policy and process that is intended to please members of the Vulcan Society, who are acting in a racist manner, forgive their actions and help them ... and this has to be stopped,” wrote Sullivan also.
A Daunting Walking Walker demanding Money
One was arrested in the city after a robbery attempt where he threatened a walking roadfarer and tried to get money from the person.
The man was stored in a cell.
Then a man with a knife was reported in the city center.
The knife was confiscated and reported by the person.
More than eighty cases came into the police board in the capital area from 17 to 05 p.m., and six were stored in a prison cell this morning.
Among other things, the police stopped a driver who drew a wheelchair at Kjalarnesi, where the wheelchair was in a very bad condition.
The wheelchair was still and intended to provide a transportation device to transfer it to the city.
Then the police stopped the production of drugs in the city.
Two were arrested for the case and were released after reporting.
There were also reports of individuals shooting fireworks in the city.
If they had left the scene when the police came to the place, “the shame would probably be known, since it is still quite a long time before the end of the year. ”
Thousands of Khabarovsk’s inhabitants still demand that Putin be resigned
Thousands of city populations joined the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday and objected to the arrest of the governor in the co-committed province, south of East Russia, and the inauguration of his successor, who has never lived in the province.
The former governor, Sergei Furgal, enjoyed great popularity, and tens of thousands of citizens protested when he was arrested and put in custody in Moscow earlier this month, accused of having ordered murder of three businessmen fifteen years ago.
In the new week, Furgal was formally replaced by a governor and his 39 - year - old class brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, with little impression of the locals.
Degtaryev is said to be inexperienced and, worse than that, without any connection with Khabarovsk, calling the citizens after his abduction.
The colds of Degtaryev have been hurrying around their ears.
Yesterday Protestants were fewer than in the first protests, fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the liberation of Furgal and the resignation of Vladimir, President of Russia.
“We want the governor to be released, because we think his arrests are highly likely to be unlawful,” has the AFP news office after a 30-year-old protestant, Alina Slepovu.
It claims that Kremler agents had Furgal arrested “to protect their own interests, not the interests of the province. ”
The police in Khabarovsk allowed protestants to be free of harassment despite the cloudless violation of the current ban on meetings because of the Coronavirus epidemic.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people assembled at Pushkin Square to show support for protestants in Khabarovsk, reports the British Guardian report.
The Furgals, the free-smoking Democrats of Russia, are a group of hard-line nationalists, and political commentators think that the Kreml Government is rather useful in most cases.
However, the same political reporters inform BBC that the victory of Furgal in the governor’s elections two years ago — which was great and uncircumcised — was a significant shock for Putin and United Russia, and suggests that the Creams in the Eastern Territories were weakening.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he awaits trial.
He is accused of ordering three murders between 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were committed, and the third went out.
Sarah Rainsford, BBC reporter in Moscow, says that Furgal’s followers, who enjoy great popularity at home, are convinced that the charge and arrest have political roots.
They want to know why the government has waited to arrest him until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged offense.
The tree branches fell when the hurricane Hanna crossed the South Texas
The hurricane Hanna fell into a tropical storm’s strength after he landed on the southern coasts of Texas on Saturday 25th, but the government warned that the storm could still cause calamity.
The U.S. Weather Service said that the greatest threat was to the southern Texas and the northeastern part of Mexico, as the weather moved west-southwest on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this video on Twitter and told Storyful that he had taken it outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
Homeless women with disabilities are involved in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman trained as a dresser, visits 250 homes every day to diagnose people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid site in Chennai, where about 10,000 cases have been reported.
She starts working early at 7:30 and ends at 4:00.
It measures the heat in the people, asks for symptoms, and teaches them the importance of using masks, washing their hands regularly, and keeping them away from others.
Its work has even led to the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of the 16,000 people of Chennai City who take care of home skis, but who are not healthcare professionals.
According to the authorities, the project has contributed to a reduction in positive cases by 50 percent, in the daily count of Chennai, while increasing in other regions of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says that not all of the inhabitants are cooperative.
She adds: “Most people cooperate when a woman with disabilities approaches them.
Some, though, become irritated.
But this is not to worry about.
I think people should be safe.
When I come back the next day, the people are polite.
It helps to build a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who live in the city's gistic room for women with disabilities and fight against Covid-19 teams.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, also with disabilities, has also participated in the campaign as a supervisor.
Although Cavitha has a specially prepared wheel, she walks to meet people and holds her chickens.
“ I’m happy, ” she says about the reduction in the rate of infection, but she adds: “I want to see them go down to maybe 100 a day.
I'm sure we can make it."
On the first floor of the gistasy where the two live, Matilda Funceca, a basketball woman using a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, and they send all the data from about 40 women into Chennai's web site.
Matilda says she is not afraid to be infected by the corona virus.
“ When we help others, God protects us, ” she adds.
When Manimekalai is asked what measures she will take, she says: “I use a mask, keep away, and often wash my hands.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a siddha drink that promotes the immune system."
A few months ago, when the crown virus first came to Chennai, these disabled women spent their time and talents sewing masks for health care professionals in the city.
As Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the ruler of the gistic artillery, as well as the Dorcas study station, says: “They are adjusting to the needs of each hour.
In the past, masks were missing, and they did not leave behind.
Now it's time to intervene in society, and they answered the call."
Tamil Nadu’s coronavirus infection has now reached 200,000 after 6989 new cases in the last 24 hours, which is also the highest number of infections reported on one day, according to official data.
Eighty - nine have died, and 7758 have recovered within 24 hours.
The total number of diseases in the country is now 206,737.
Police are trying to reach the last trip of a teenager in Helensburgh
Investigators investigating the death of a teenage child in Helensburgh are now trying to set a timeline for his last trips.
The body of 19 - year - old Kirk Allan was found in a home in Johnson Court about 6:25 a.m. on Saturday.
A 30 - year - old man was arrested, and on Sunday the police confirmed that he had been accused of the death.
He'll be in court at Dumbarton on Monday.
Inspector Steve Martin said: “Our mind is with Kirk’s family and friends in these difficult times.
Police will continue to work with the community and support it.
Our research is aimed at getting a full picture of what happened, especially of Kirk's journeys in the last days of his death, but we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox tell about their experience of discrimination
The last few weeks have become clear that many skeletons are still in the closet in relation to racial rights in sports in South Africa.
Upbuilding conversations need to take place, and action must be taken in order for everyone to be welcomed in sports.
Ashwell Prince, former cricket star of Proteas, told his white former teammates about it and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other black teammen were “cotplayers. ”
Prince said that Proteas’ black players were officially called “cotplayers ” of their white teammates.
He added that it would be sad that even though black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada reached the highest ranks in sport, some people still linked them to the quota talk.
Prince, now a coach of the Cape Cobras team, made this statement appear at the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) on Thursday night.
The aim of the organizations is to pursue the fierce discussion of historical racial rights in South African sports.
“ As I said when I lightened up on social media, it is not my intention to come and draw people’s names into the area, but these are real events...
“You do everything right but still get infected ”
Paul Roberts, a former musician and a builder who became an author of NASA, now works for a software company.
He and his wife, a former nurse at the Methodist Hospital who views themselves as a optimist, kept a hobby magazine on the Internet and attended the Comic Con event earlier.
Once a week, they whisper with their two daughters, their son-in-law, and their 7-year-old grandchild, and they play a sexy Uno game.
“ They are amazing nerds, ” says 38 - year - old Roman about their parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65 years of age, is aware of the dangers of the epidemic — diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that may put her at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a backbone that keeps a previously blocked coronary vein open.
“ We’ve been so careful, very careful, and stay away from people, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began to work from home this spring, when the epidemic hit Washington, New York, and other areas throughout the country.
Paul has occasionally gone into a supermarket during “old times, ” and their only real date for the past few months was, according to Sheryl, when they began to check wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter was also careful.
Then, on a day of June, she sneezed home from work and thought that she was allergic.
Soon she had cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea and lost all taste and smell, which are typical symptoms of the corona virus.
She said, “I don’t know what's going on, Mom, but I had a mask, I had gloves, I washed my hands, ” Sheryl said.
“ You do everything right, but you get infected. ”
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with a positive coronavirus infection, did not become severely ill.
However, her parents felt much worse about the situation.
Paul Roberts and his wife began to sneeze and then cough, just as their daughter did, and then they had a lot of heat and pain in their bodies.
Then, Sheryl Roberts said, “he became very sick, very quickly. ”
On June 22, he became confused.
She was worried about his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency hospital, for the second time in two days.
According to a new book, the former royal couple felt that they were “ignored ” in the Queen’s Christmas talk
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Bretaprin found his grandmother, Queen Bretad, “to ignore ” them in their Christmas talk.
The new life story of the couple, “Finding Freedom, ” reveals that they were found to be overlooked by those in the gallery that appeared in the Christmas talk.
Pictures on the desk at which the queen sat, among other things, showed William Bretaprin, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Bretaprin, and his wife, Kamilla, as well as Prince Philip.
However, despite Archie’s birth in May, Meghan and Harry were nowhere to see, yet the boy was referred to as her Majesty’s “dead grandchild. ”
The new book, published in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton “were never friends ” because they “have difficulty in getting over surface politeness ” and only met a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that the dispute between Harry and his brother William began some years before his relationship with Meghan began, but that it reached its climax because of William’s and Kate Middleton’s marriage.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was a “backward ” at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and it is said that “he wanted to change things long before Meghan came to life. ”
The Conservatives accuse workers’ leaders of wanting to keep officials “world forever. ”
The Conservatives accuse workers' leaders of wanting public workers to be “world forever, ” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work
Activity officers were accused of wanting people to “stand at home forever ” after protesting Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work.
Congressmen were indignant when the officials and public staff organizations told their associates to shrink their feet when their commanders ordered them to return to their jobs.
Andrew Percy, former minister, said “unacceptable ” that the necessary official service, such as the version of passports, was stopped while employees in the public market had worked hard to keep society moving in the crown virus epidemic.
“ It is unacceptable that people refuse to return to their work while the workers of warehouses and factorys throughout the country have continued to work so that official staff can eat during this period, ” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to go on vacation, but they can’t do so because of the people who refuse to go back to their jobs, although safe.
Workers cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever – especially now that we know people can return to work safely."
At the request of the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, the newly appointed manager of the public service, announced that a minister should “revert from working at home in public service and speeding up their return to their jobs until August 1st. ”
The work community of officials and public staff, who counts about 200,000, stated that they did not have to comply with this requirement, and that this is about politics.
A spokesman of the official and public workers’ union, the largest worker association in Britain, said that the requirement to return to work places was “not presented by the health and safety of our social partners, or to strengthen the economy.
This is simply done because of political pressure from the Conservatives who insist that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to social partners is clear: If you do your work at home and someone in your department asks you to return to the workplace, do not take it that, of course, you have to do it."
The issue is due to growing dissatisfaction with delayed releases of passports because employees work at home, but about 4000,000 people are now said to be waiting for their applications to be completed.
The Ministry of the Interior has now announced that it will “seek to speed up” applications from the UK for travel in the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport release for more than four weeks.
The Labour Association of Public and General Staff has acknowledged that some have had to wait up to 143 days for passports, but maintains that “little and often narrow offices” make it difficult for 4,000 staff of the passport service to keep the necessary distance.
The former government minister, David Davis, encouraged the leaders of a trade union to “behave wisely ” and to seek ways of cooperating with governments to bring people back into their jobs.
He added, then, that if he were a government, he would ask an officer, “What do you want, that people stay at home all summer? ”
Likewise, some of the largest companies in Britain have ignored Johnson’s recommendation to return to work.
A study of larger jobs with a total of about 4000,000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
Highlighting on History Can Be An Important Pact
The gap has expanded, but understanding and reconciliation should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this shortage of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught by an Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only teaching article that specifically deals with our history — “Australia Story ” for 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in Victoria finished studying the history of Australia of a total of 49,324 graduates, or just 1%.
Over the past six years, this number has almost fallen by half, but nearly 100 fewer students are enrolled each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about the history of Australia in the 12th grade is that little has been done during their previous study years to interest them.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls within the wider “science. ”
Therefore, in the 7th and 8th grade, students complete only one brief unit of “premiere and island peaks in the south of Torres and their culture. ”
During the 9th and 10th years there is another unity in Australia in the world wars.
For many students in Victoria, this is all the teachings about Australia’s history during the early school years.
During the 9th and 10th years, there is another optional unit in the period 1750-1918.
It is important to take three steps to save Australian history in Victoria’s schools.
First, history must become an independent study article, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is taught only as a part of mind science, it has little room in the study schedule.
It is usually taught by people who have general education in mental science but have not educated in history.
Historical skills such as the analysis of information are complex.
To ensure that such skills are taught in an accessible and exciting way, we must employ more specialized historian teachers.
Third, Australia’s history from 1788 to 1914 must become an obligation.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history during the 12th year of study, since they would have had to learn the material from the ground.
Knowledge of history alone does not see a bridge of deep racial crises.
But without it, as clearly shown in the Victorian State study program, the project is hopeless.
Dr. Matthew Bach is a Senator of Freedom at the Victorian Congress and the former assistant school manager of Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.
Aaron Elis in a European Championship — Isaac in half
Aaron Elis Thunderson has come to the European Championship of the Danish High School of Football.
Isaac Bergmann Johnson played only the first half of the game with the top of Norrköping against the bottom of Falkenberg, Sweden.
Aaron Elis was on the OB team in Denmark when the team continued to play a championship for the European League.
The OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, which depends on whether the end of the joints will be higher after the final cycle of the top of the Danish election department later today.
Aaron Elis played the whole game with Horsens at the end of the day, with the OB winning the first game of the teams in the home field, 3-1, and won one-off in total 4-2.
Isaac was at the start of the North Creation, which was unexpectedly 2 to 0 below after the first half-time against the Falkenberg base in the Swedish election department.
At the beginning of the second half of the world, the creation of the north made a triple division, and Isaac was one of those who had to move.
Norrköping scored, but Falkenberg reached 3-2 over the 89th minute.
However, there was still a time for Norrköping to recover from hell in the last minute, 3-3.
Norrköping remains on top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsburg, and five points ahead of Malmö who plays later today.
Falkenberg was able to get off the bottom for a while, but the team has a step above Helsingborg and Kalmar that has a good game.
Gathering Documents on a National Festival in Crown Virus Times
Anna Lilja Winning Daughter set up the Facebook group "My National Festival 2020" to gather papers about the national festival that the Eyjams will hold on the next weekend.
Many are going to camp in their gardens and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja talked to hvata in the series Helgin on the Wave.
“ There is nothing yet that is very exciting, too, because there are 600 people in the group, so people are clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lilja.
There's something about the islanders having camp parties at home.
“ People have talked about having their own [feast], perhaps tenting in the garden, and hobbing the family together, as people always do at that time, ” says Anna.
“ You expect people to spend time with their own people.
However, it is likely that many people will not be present, “but still have a small nation feast somewhere else. ”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to repay the tickets purchased, but Anna believes that many locals will rather secure tickets at the festival of the next year.
“ People are even investing in the tickets now and are valid before 2021. ”
“ I am a great National Festival, love the preparation and all around it, but sometimes something comes into life that you don’t control, and that’s just how it is, ” says Anna, who has said that people are asking if the Islands can’t let the National Festival go “one time. ”
Anna Lilja claims that she has not set up the group for herself or to encourage people to have their own National Festival, but to gather clarifications about trade sanctuaries in the islands this year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in anything or anything, but then some people who use such sources in something but I was just creating some area where people can install what they're doing."
At the same time, a fire has been uploaded on Fibral that is turned on every year.
“ I think many people are excited to get burned on Friday evening.
Of course, the only thing that makes a point in the account is that the prediction is not a point."
“ This burn will be set on fire, ” says Anna Lilja, “but it just has to be known how it will be. ”
You can listen to the interview with Anna Lilja as a whole in the player below.
Will Prince Andreas be mentioned in new documents on sexual offences?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in legal documents on his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A U.S. judge has ordered that secret documents on Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Among these 80 pages of documents are parts with Maxwell’s testimony from 2016
The display of these pages could also put great pressure on Prince Andreas, where there are communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, a prosecuted sex slave of the scorned American financer, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced to interact with Prince Andreas.
Prince Andreas now prepares for defending the possible publication of information this week with the even more damaging accusation of his friendship with the child abuser Jeffrey Epstein and his supposed coworker, Ghislaine Maxwell.
In the week, the U.S. district judge Loretta Preska ordered the publication of 80 secret legal documents in connection with Maxwell and Epstein, counting hundreds of pages.
The display of these tremendous documents would be a shock for the 58 - year - old Maxwell, where they have much to store with its witness to lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “good questions ” about her sexual history.
They could also put great pressure on Prince André, where one of the documents contains communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, referring to the offended American financer, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced three times to interact with Andrew.
Andrew has repeatedly and firmly rejected these claims.
An e - mail from 2015, which has been leaked and published by the BBC last year, seems to indicate that Andrew asked Maxwell to help respond to Robert’s claims.
We have no doubt that the Duke will be revolted
There he said to the senior woman: “Let me know when we can talk, and I have some questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied, “I have information, call me when you have time. ”
Last night, a close - handed source of Andrew said: “The chief of Jorvik has not done anything wrong, so we are not concerned about the opening of legal documents.
As the U.S. courts have insisted on pointing to them, this does not mean that a accusation is true if it is presented in legal documents.
The U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to take full care of the accusations presented in legal documents.
We fully agree with that.
We have no doubt that the Duke will be fully revolted in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in custody in Manhattan, awaiting trial for finding and enticing some of the victims of Epstein who were under legal age from 1994 to 1997.
She is also accused of sanctions for refusing knowledge when reporting his abuse.
She rejects all the accusations.
Maxwell last spoke with lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s headquarters, now known as Giuffre, who she recorded after marriage.
Some 40 pages of a total of 418 witnessing was made public last year, but after the decision of the judge Presna of New York last week, more parts could be opened first on Thursday.
Maxwell’s lawyers had one week to make an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his jail in New York last year when he was being tried for sexual offences.
Police are looking for a gang for a violent attack on Edinburgh streets
Three attacked a man in Edinburgh and hurt him that could be lasting.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked in Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 a.m. on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been brought to the royal hospital with serious injuries.
The investigator Dale Miles, director of the investigation, said: “It was a violent and relentless attack. ”
The suspects escaped to Newtoft Street.
One of them was considered to be in his 30 ’ s, about 180 cm [180 cm] in height, and heavily grown.
He was short - cut and dark - haired in a white shirt, dark trousers, and dark shoes.
Detective Miles said: “I pray to all those in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious about submitting. ”
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the U.S. Ambassador in Iceland, wants to carry a gun on the land and want to increase security.
He is said to have been “a paranoid ” about his safety since his arrival last year.
This is noted in the CBS report, which also says that this is what Gunter wants, despite working in “one of the safest kingdoms in the world. ”
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs to ask the Icelandic government to carry a gun.
Then he has asked for a armored car and a vest that protects him from knives.
However, CBS authors say that the Ministry repeatedly reported Gunter that he is not at risk in Iceland.
CBS reports that the State Department of Foreign Affairs did not provide information on whether a request was made from the United States for Gunter’s potential arms supply, because the authorities did not express their opinion on foreign security measures.
Although no request has been made, the sources of the news office say that it has not been made.
Then, too, CBS has it after his sources have been told that Gunter should not seek to carry a weapon, so it would be taken as offense here on the land.
Gunter is an unexperienced ambassador, who has been a skin disease doctor in California for years.
He's active in the U.S. Republican League and heavily supportive of President Donald Trump.
He recently attracted attention here in the country when he was whipping about the “invisible China Virus. ”
CBS writers also say that Gunter seriously affected the U.S. ambassador in Reykjavik.
He already had seven second - commanded staff in the Embassy since May last year.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to “the Deep Empire, ” which is to be the network of American officials working against Trump, and he resented the fact that one was carrying snow into his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS.
Gunter said he wanted to work from California, but in the end, the U.S. Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, had to order him to return and did so in May.
The home game form is key to Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has easier games to play when fans are allowed to come back into a game
With Jose Mourinho’s help, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game in the homefield since the excellence department rebooted, but he says that it would be much easier to maintain good gang at home if the audience were released.
Questions have won 12 wins in the homefield during this season, but they have lost four times — only one of the six teams above them has lost more in the homefield.
The Portuguese coach said that even if such a victory was possible without the adherents, it would be easier to maintain it if they were there.
“ We have to do this with the fans, ” he said, “without them a fortress of some kind can be built.
“ But I think it would be much more powerful to do it with the fans, because it adds to the emotional side of the game, which only comes with fans in the home stadium. ”
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain the long triumphal periods he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up the last three seasons.
However, this is also a key factor in determining whether the stages will reach their goals at the end of the period, especially in equal games and neighboring laws, where the atmosphere of the field can make a difference.
“ I believe the policy of the elite department is that it is now becoming more difficult to beat these unsatisfactory records because of how good the past has been. ”
“ On the other hand, it is important to be strong in the homefield and have, at the end of the season, brought in a number of ladders with wins in home games. ”
“ I’m pleased with the finals of the home games recently, without the fans, but we need them back.
I can see a victory against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
It's a feeling that's built up gradually."
Buyers are excited about the desired style of life in Lovely Banks
“ Greater is better, ” is evidently the motto of the new owners of huge property in Lovely Banks’ neighborhood, which was sold in 1270 Australian dollars.
Interesting buyers in search of lifestyle near the centre of Geelong went to explore this 1.35 acres land, where 14 cars, pools and views of the Corio Bay can be found.
Joe Grgic, a real estate vendor in Harcourts, North-Geelong, said that an offer on the land that Cuddihy Court 1 was approved within 10 days of being placed on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back to sale
Home ideal for isolation
“We received a number of offers from various parties, ” said Grgic.
“The property was sold to a homeman who is very excited. ”
The land includes four rooms in two floors, where you can find a special bath room large enough to bed a sofa.
The new owners have a choice of three rooms and can use their own kitchen and updating their outdoor areas with a view over the pool.
“It was in the way the property was composite, that it was three oaks, and that it was in this place, ” said Grgic.
“ Here came interested buyers from Melbourne who wondered what the property was in the middle but still had a landscape.
“ I have people who missed and buyers who are still looking. ”
He said that the large storage area, which includes a double garage and a standby shelter of 10-12 vehicles, is perfect for industrialists or for storage of wheelchairs and trailers.
Thinking of its security in Iceland
“ Despite being appointed as the safest country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been paranoid about his safety since his arrival in Reykjavik last year. ”
This is how CBS News begins a detailed discussion of the U.S. ambassador in Iceland, which imitates a number of CBS records from the U.S. Foreign Service.
CBS claims that Gunter requested to the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he would be given special permission to the Icelandic authorities to carry firearms.
Then he should also have requested a armored car, as well as an idea of a vest that could protect him from stabbing.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to state publicly whether Gunter’s safety is seriously threatened in Iceland, but according to information from officials, Gunter has been repeatedly expressed that he is not in any special danger.
Nevertheless, the U.S. embassy in Iceland recently announced full - time lifeguards, including the Morning newspaper of July 18, but CBS’ records simulate that it is done to sever Gunter’s concerns.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not express itself on a number of safety measures related to its ambassador, but always states the objective of preventive security.
The Ministry does not answer questions regarding Gunter's wish to arm and the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not want to say whether the U.S. has formally requested that the ambassador bear a weapon, and says that he does not express himself on the security of foreign offices.
However, CBS has noted that the request was never made, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was disposed of from these plans, where they could insult locals in Iceland.
CBS also discusses the various problems that have been adjacent to the United States Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will have already replaced his advisor seven times.
Thus, the first Deputy Minister is said to have prepared for his work for a long time and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the position at the last moment because Gunter is not “leasing to him” at their first meeting.
His successors haven't been much better under Gunter's control.
The governments of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs are told to be aware of the position of the Embassy in Iceland, but are reluctant to intervene in matters closely linked to the President.
In addition to all this, Gunter is said to be reluctant to comply with the various rules of the foreign service and to respect the order of power.
Gunter traveled to the U.S. in February to attend a conference in Washington, and it is said to have refused to return to Iceland as a result, allowing his temporary surrogate to do his work for months, and this in the middle of a pandemic.
Will Gunter even have wished to do his remote work and said that he would not return to Iceland unless the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically asked for it.
According to information from the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take his personal permission at the end of the conference and the Chronavirus epidemic delayed his journey further, but according to CBS sources, many within the Ministry have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he did not do so until May, after Pompeo contacted him and asked him to return to the Embassy in Iceland.
CBS also reports the impopulations of Gunters in Iceland, especially in connection with the thwarts, where he calls the “invisible China virus ” and has received great criticism.
Gunter is one of a number of almost inexperienced ambassadors who have been appointed during the reign of President Donald Trump of the United States.
Sachin Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; Bharatiya Janata Company says government crisis in the state; Congress Group wants vote payment
Ashok Gehlot said that if this was needed, the Congress Group would have to conduct session conventions outside the home of the Prime Minister.
On Saturday, a day after a peaceful protest against Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, Minister of Prime Minister of Rajasthan, said that if it was necessary, congressmen would have to meet the president and material for session conventions outside the home of the Prime Minister to bring the crisis to the state.
At the congressmen’s meeting, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to hold a vote to check whether the majority of the members of the Senate and his associates were in the power battle.
“ He said that the government had a majority and wants to vote, ” says Mahesh Joshi, the head of the Congress party, after the meeting.
The meeting was held at a hotel where the members of Gehlot have held their last days.
“ The Prime Minister asked us to be prepared to stay longer at the hotel.
If necessary, he said, he would meet the President and also hold a peaceful protest outside the home of the Prime Minister," said a party leader.
Mr Rajasthan may convene the Assembly and allow the Congress Group to demonstrate its majority," said class leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, indicating that the Bharatiya Janata Group had found a way to dismantle Ashok Gehlot's government.
“The country is now governed by law and Constitution.
Governments are formed and operate with the public authority.
Bharatiya Janata’s plan to cast the government of Rajasthan has been discovered.
This is an insult to the 80 million inhabitants of Rajasthan.
The Prime Minister must convene the Congress to bring the truth before the land," said Gandhi in the mood of Hindu.
On Saturday, Mr Gehlot, Prime Minister of Rajasthan, told congressmen that he was prepared to go to a meeting with the President of India to ensure that what he calls “Bharatiya Janata’s strategy ” is not successful in delaying a declaration of trust by voting.
On Friday, Gehlot, who protested for hours at the home of the governor Kalraj Mishra to press a conference, met with the congressmen and the government on Saturday, and after the meeting, new proposals were constructed and approved by a government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to return the request for a meeting and referred to six objections.
The proposal will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying the meeting where he is “under pressure ” to delay the vote that determines the trust of his government.
When Gehlot met his government, the Bharatiya Janata embassy met with the leader of Satish Poonia and the leader of the Governing Opposition of Gulab Chandra Kataria with the Governor to discuss the position of COVID-19 in the State.

Actor Spencer Grammer channel given outside a restaurant in Manhattan
NEW YORK – The actor Spencer Grammar said he was trying to calm a man when he cut her arm and stabbed her friend in the back outside of a restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, 36 years old, told US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation as they had tried to prevent the situation from getting worse when attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend were sitting at the outdoor table at The Black Ant in the East Villagetown of Manhattan at 23:30 p.m.
On Friday, when a man came up to them, and demanded to be paid, the restaurant was being closed.
Grammer and her friend were injured when they tried to “resolve differences between an unknown man and other local guests, ” says the police.
The man ran off the place after having wounded the right arm of Grammer and stabbed her friend into the back with an unknown sharp object, said the police.
Nobody's been arrested.
Grammer, who speaks to Summer in the "Rick and Morty" shows and played earlier in the "Greek" series of ABC Family, is the daughter of the "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and the actor Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both her and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a declaration to US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded at the scene and the staff of the Bellevue Hospital who listened to them and mentioned the “fabulous struggle ” of this staff to the crown virus epidemic.
“ It touched us very much to have the opportunity to thank them personally, ” said Grammer.
“ I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic night on UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The Khamzat Chimaev of Russia is now named as the next star of UFC after enrolling in the history of Fight Island, but he says that he is not seeking to flag his wealth in a savage way, like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried the North Irish Rhys McKee overpower in their battle in a volatile Abu Dabi on Saturday night when he defeated his competitor when three minutes and nine seconds had passed out of the first round by blowing him down on the floor.
The victory recorded the name of Chimaev in UFC’s history for the shortest time between the conquests in modern history, where only 10 days had passed since he defeated British John Phillips in a similar decisive way, then intermediately.
Chimaev, who has the winning rate of 8-0, received a bonus of $50,000 for the evening’s performance against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that it is now called “Khalib 2.0”, which can be said to be an inevitable comparison because of the great probability of Chimaev and the UFC championship in lightweight and where it is born in Téénia, near the home of Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite the newly found fame and financial gain, the translated Chimaev has said that he would not be keen to flag his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his peer in the box world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I’m not just doing this for myself, I’m doing it for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something.
I want to help people," answered Chimaev when he was asked for it on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
Among other things, he has noticed Conor McGregor's teammate and the active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social label that he could “easily ” defeat Chimaev with a give-up.
It did not appear in a toxic response from the warrior named “Borz, ” or“ wolf ” in his native language, who said that he would “male Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who now lives in Stockholm, Sweden, after his 19 - year - old flytte to the country, may not be in favor of his financial power, but he is evidently reluctant to dress up his ability to fight.
“ I can beat anyone...
How many fighters do you have in the Volkswagen?
I can beat them all," he said.
“ Give me 77 kilograms of championship, 84 kilograms of championship (millivly), I will crush them both, on the same day. ”
Israel continues to protest the premier’s response to the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested against the Prime Minister in many parts of the country on Saturday and were the largest protests outside the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks, but they began because critics believe that the government’s neglect should respond to the coronary virus epidemic after initially succeeding in keeping the threat of the virus under control.
Prosecution against Netanyahu for corruption has further promoted the protest.
“ Bibi, go home, ” stood on the sign of one of the Protestants.
On the second board, “All see that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Hundreds of Protestants also gathered outside Netanyahu’s coastal house in Caesarea’s wealthy town.
Last week, the police used water guns to scatter groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called the rapid and unorganized reopening of economics in May, the average number of new cases per day increased to 2000.
The country's economy has been struck by the limitations of the virus and unemployment has grown to almost 20%.
Protestants say that the government’s financial assistance was not close enough.
The protests took place in a shadow of the trial of corruption charges against Netanyahu, which began again during the month.
Interrogation begins in January.
He is accused of betrayal, disloyalty, and bribery in a series of scandalous cases.
Hundreds of Protestants meet in the center of Los Angeles to share with Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – Some 300 Protestants met in the city of Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon to support two - month - old movements in Portland, Oregon, focusing on federal police after fighting with Protestants.
Similar protest meetings were held throughout the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The protests in Los Angeles were organized by the Refuse Fascism and the Youth Liberation Front groups.
The team went to the headquarters of the Los Angeles police on First Street and Main Street and then to the center of the city area.
The participants also moved over to the Alameda departure on the 101 motorway but left it later.
Parts of the people were seen breaking windows in public buildings in the city, and cruel words were written on public labels.
At least one person was arrested in the protests.
50 constraints in mosquitoes at the Eid Festival and no prayers in Eidgah, says the government of Karnataka
The festival Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, will take place on July 31 and August 1st.
The governments of Karnataka have announced that only 50 may come together in mosquitoes for the sake of Eid-ul-Azha and have forbidden prayer meetings at Eidgah and other places for the Chronavirus epidemic.
Guests wishing to pray in mosquitoes must have masks and keep them away, according to the order of AB Ibrahim, Ministerial Secretary of Minority and Wakf.
The order states that the Hilal Committee decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, should be held on 31 July in the provinces of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu, but on 1 August elsewhere in the State.
The order states that although prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of Muslims at the Bakrid festival, such events will be banned at Eidgah and other places for the COVID-19 epidemic.
However, prayers will be allowed in mosquitoes provided that no more than 50 are involved at a time.
If more than the time of prayer is to be divided, says the Deputy Minister in the Decree.
Prayer meetings may not be held anywhere else, such as meeting houses, social centers or “Shadi Mahal, ” as stated.
The Karnataka authorities allow temples, mosquitoes and other petitions to be opened to those who wish to pray since 8 June, provided that they are well protected for the protection of COVID-19.
The American ambassador wants an armed bodyguard.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the U.S. Ambassador in Iceland, thinks his life is threatened in the country and wants to carry a weapon.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Embassy repeatedly advertised by bodyguards in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertising.
According to the sources of Kick, the main reason why these jobs were advertised is that Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter thinks his life is endangered in Iceland.
A light has discussed with sources in Iceland and abroad who tell the ambassador that he is in great danger, and the reason is that he is Jewish.
What the threat is, is not as clear, but the spokesmen of Knick said that Islamic terrorists had been called a threat.
This morning, the TV station CBS discussed the matter on its website and notes that Gunter is a persecutor, demands to carry his own weapons, to get a stump-resistant vest and armed escort, as well as a bulletproof car.
According to CBS, Gunter has repeatedly been told that there is no threat and that the “bodyguard” advertising is only to sed Gunter.
According to the sources of the Kick, the posts were not set at the end of June, but the deadline for application expired in February.
According to the sources of Lightning, the embassy of the United States has not received any formal announcements because of these changes.
Neither formally has been requested for increased guarding nor for a warrant for survivors to run armed outside the ambassador’s walls.
Icelandic law is decisive that this is not allowed unless with a special authorisation from the Governor of the State.
Reasoners within the control system say there is no information on any kind of threat.
The newest risk assessment of the Marshal is quite decisive of terrorist threats.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence of the activity of terrorists or extreme groups here.
The basis for authorising the arms of a foreign embassy in the streets of cities and towns in Iceland is, according to the sources of Lightning, not available.
Gunter attracted a lot of attention here in the country when he split up the president of the United States and called the COVID-19 “China Virus. ”
Then he had the American and Iceland flag.
A radioman in Seattle who was ridiculed by Trump's reaction to protest says he now needs a gun after the Starbucks café beneath his apartment was destroyed – RT USA News
Paul Gallant has gained a new perspective on violent protests after mocking the president of Donald Trump in June for saying that the Anarchists were burning and robbed Seattle City.
The only thing that had to be done was to move closer to the manager’s home.
“ I feel like I have to buy a gun, ” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that the devastators had “destructed” the Starbucks café at the bottom floor of his house.
“Now it's enough, it looks like a street party down my street.
Trump complained last month that the mayor of Seattle was allowing violent Protestants to take over the city.
“These liberal Democrats have no sense, ” said the president.
“ The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they find it just wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, co-inspector of the “Danny & Gallant ” program at the ESPN, Seattle, replied:“ Go through there for curiosity last night and did not see any burns, robbery or death.
Gallant said last night the police advised residents to stay away from his apartment building where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks café.
He published pictures of the damage and said, “Goodly done, you idiots, ” and stated that he had also seen fire a few blocks away.
"I have no idea what's going on, but we're going to find out."
The reverse did not pass by people who mocked Gallant for his previous opinion and threw messages such as “Just relax on salmon, ” and “Jah, maybe Trump was right. ”
Jason Rantz, another radioman in Seattle, said: “Well, we shouldn’t finally go on this voyage that we were discussing. ”
Gallant went along with the joke: “Waking up and seeing that a lot of people were whipping ‘ relaxing on salmon ’ to me. I laughed. ”
He said he stood up to his previous claim that he had gone through the CHAZ autonomy area of anarchists and though it was not as bad as it had been declared as.
“ So it was burned and robbed after all, ” he said.
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, in an apartment search with his 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, began together at the scene of the White Lines, which dealt with sucking and boasting on Ibiza, but during the past week their appearance was different and quieter, far from the party life.
The couple who play a brother and sister in the Netflix series were seen looking at a magnificent countryside in Oxfordshire, which is for sale of £1.2 million.
They came to the Range Rover area, which Laura, 34, drove, weared shorts and white shirts, and met a real estate vendor that led them to a visit by the five - room house.
In the White Lines, which were recorded last fall, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who met the darker side of Ibiza when she investigated the murder of her brother, Alex, who is played by Tom at 28 years of age.
Their relationship was not discovered until earlier in this month, less than a year after the end of Lauru’s six - year marriage with Sam Claflin, known from the Hunger Games movies.
Together, they have the four - year - old son, Pip, and the two - year - old daughter, Margot.
When they announced the divorce in August last year, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: “I’ve decided to understand divorce, we understand in love, friendship, and with deep respect for each other, and we will continue our cooperation in raising our children.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 in an audition, and Sam, who has also played at Peaky Blinders, described their wedding in 2013 as “without delay one of the greatest achievements of my life. ”
Before Laura got her role in the White Lines, she had played in the first Inb betweeners movie, and in the criminal drama The Capture from the BBC, which was shown last year, where she played the lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom had a role in the second Inb Mellaners film and in the series Brittania of Sky.
Counts too early to claim about another wave here in the country
An expert in the field of health care at the local medical office says too early to claim the second wave of the epidemic.
Three new internal diseases were detected at the hospital’s Virologic Department last night, and dozens of them are in diplomas.
Two internal infections were detected on Thursday, one in a man of thirty years and the other in a man of 20 ’ s.
Then there had been no diagnosis since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, there were three more internal infestations, one of which had been at the Rey Cup football convention in Laugadal.
Johan K. Johannsson, a U.S. Marshal Information Officer, says in a conversation with a news office that fewer people had to take samples for this infection than they originally thought.
The second is a person who arrived in the country from abroad on July 15.
At that time, rules on the so - called home portal had been valid.
However, Kamilla Rut Sigfusdad, a medical specialist at the National Medical Office, says that he or she followed the old process.
His vision was negative at the time of his arrival, but then he became sick, is in isolation, and six have been placed in divorce.
They're all on their way to audition, but two of them have started to show symptoms.
The third infection has to do with the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and has been associated with it with 12 cases.
It has been found that there is a new variant of the corona virus that has not been detected in this country.
“ We don’t know exactly where these viruses come from, but we haven’t seen them before.
Whoever was considered to have carried the virus to the land had been in Israel, but also in other European countries."
It considers it too early to claim that the so - called second wave of the epidemic has begun in this country, just as other European countries fear.
“ While the majority is still traceable, it is not desirable to eat.
But we're on our toes and we're watching, thinking about ways to fail if something like that could start."
Megan Fox expresses himself on his relationship.
Megan Fox says he found his twin soul in the machine gun Kelly.
“ As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I'm interested in starmarks, and I knew right away that my twin soul was about to be," says Fox, 34 years old.
“ A twin soul is when the soul has reached a sufficient degree of existence to divide itself into two different bodies at the same time, ” explained Fox.
“ So we are two half the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away."
“ When we had known each other for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch, and I taught him about the constellations, and I asked him about his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly is in the same line, but they met a movie.
“ I was hanging outside her wheelchair, hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Just two months ago Fox left his husband for ten years, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim.
The American musician, the tingo and President Kanye West have apologized for his wife, Kim Kardashian West, for a statement that he officially gave about the family’s personal affairs.
“ I want to apologize to my wife Kim for discussing personal matters publicly, ” he wrote in a post on Twitter last night.
While he has been considering the situation of their relationship, Kanye has recently spent a lot of time in social media and in a mass meeting he held last Monday, he discussed the birth of his daughter North West and said that he had almost killed her.
Then Kim stepped on Wednesday and published a message to her followers at Instagram, where she discussed her husband’s illness, who is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously expressed himself publicly about the husband’s illness, saying that it is, among other things, because of the children of their marriage and that Kanye is entitled to privacy when his health comes.

An Increase in Protestant Racial Rights in the United States
Protestants have walked through the streets of many cities in the United States to draw attention to racial rights.
Protests have lasted for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd killed a police prisoner in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent federal marshals to Portland, and thus still motivated the protests.
Protestants now also object to the presence of the federal police officers in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, the police used flame bombs and tear gas and arrested 45 people after a protest meeting to support the protests in Portland was dissolved in violence.
According to the police, more than 20 officers were injured.
One died on a Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was released into the Black Lives Matter demanding walk.
The media reports that before he was shot, the man may have walked up to a car with a rifle.
“ The point is that it is horrible that someone dies in protests, ” said Mayor Austin, Steve Adler.
Adler claimed to be “sorgful and speechless. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when a policeman broke into her home, authorized to enter without banking, and shot her.
Taylor's boyfriend had first shot the police, because he thought they were burglars.
One policeman has been fired for Taylor's death, but the other policemen have not been charged.
The NFAC Group's pre-practice, armed by a group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in a police investigation on Taylor's murder.
According to the police, three members of the NFAC were injured on Saturday when accidentally fired by the rebel force.
Potential seal group infection
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside of border spacing.
Two of them were diagnosed with an unspecified virus form, and the origin of three of the five viruses seems to be completely vague.
It is not known whether the individuals have been infected by a returning tourist or the asymptomatic Iceland, who is likely to have infected much more people.
The surgeon of the clinic says that a possible group infection may be associated with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 on the country last Thursday, with each type of virus.
The origin of the infection is still unclear.
Three were then diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by one of those diagnosed on Thursday, the other came to the country on July 15, and was probably infected outside, but the third is also infected with a vague origin.
After a series of gene analyses, the two subjects diagnosed with the virus and associated have a new variant that has not been identified in this country.
Camilla Joseph’s daughter, a medical specialist in the field of health care, and a surrogate of a clinician, says that an Icelandic genetic analysis is now taking place where this type of virus is most likely to come from.
“ The second case was a similar virus in Switzerland, but not exactly the same.
They are going to examine this and try to map it better and lead the likes out of what part of the infection comes from," she says.
“ But it seems to be here on the side of the Atlantic. ”
Therefore, the infection is unrelated to the two who arrived at the beginning of July and were led to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has arrived outside rather than being mutant here in the country?
“ Yes, it’s different from what has been found here before that there’s really no chance that it was something wrong here, ” Kamilla answers.
“ There is every chance that these individuals have somehow come into any position with a person who has just arrived somewhere outside, without knowing it for himself. ”
The question says that at present there is no evidence of where this new virus might have come from.
“ It could naturally be a traveler who has left the country again, but it could also be someone who does not have any symptoms and does not realize that he has been infected and could naturally cause more infection.
We'll be on our toes the next few days to watch it."
“ At present, there is no concealed group infection.
However, there are individuals who went to the clinic in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have already taken samples," Kamilla continues.
“ We have not yet come to their conclusions.
So it could possibly be a group infection in a seal."
Do you suppose this is a social problem now?
“ That is not impossible.
It has not been in the past, but it is not impossible because we do not know who has carried this infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on the one hand on Tuesday and yesterday."
Would it be possible to say that we are starting a new wave of the virus?
“ No, not yet.
But naturally, we need to be very alert, and we need to keep this in mind, even though there are so limited limits on how much vision we can take in people.
We don't take a sample in the asymptomatic people, but first that we're getting an infection that seems unrecognitive, we need to be given a little more loose hands by taking a sample from people with symptoms," she says.
In this way, in the next days, the navy and virologic department will be expected to give in the samples to try to better identify the position in the country.
Does the Diabetes have the ability to increase domestic sampling and screen the border?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there needs to be some basis for taking a sample in individuals who are not in the screening work; the person must be in sickness and have symptoms or have had symptoms and suspected that he had come into contact with someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
It states that the infection is still in progress on the diseases detected yesterday and that there is now much work to do to obtain information on the travels of individuals.
It says that the origin of the internal infection seems unrecognized, but does not exclude that some of the people who have now been infected can provide evidence that ultimately leads the infection team to the original infection.
The restaurant most people don't know but they think it's one of the best.

Mick Fleetwood praises Peter Green: “His music will live ”
Mick Fleetwood praised Peter Green, with Fleetwood Mac, who died today at the age of 73.
Green was a member of this historic rock band, along with the former Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Despite the fact that Green left the band in 1970, before reaching its peak with records such as Rumours, Mick has praised this former band member and assured fans that “his music will continue to live. ”
“For me and all of the former and present members of Fleetwood Mac it’s losing Peter Green a great memorial, ” Fleetwood said in a conversation with PA.
“ Peter was the man who founded Fleetwood Mac, along with me, John McVie, and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined Fleetwood Mac without deep respect for Peter Green and his talents, and the fact that the music should shine brightly and be moved by unshakable passion."
“ Peter, I will miss you, but make sure your music will live, ” added the 73 - year - old rock star.
“ I thank you for asking if I wanted to be your drum all these years.
We did well, and we did well with a proper way of music that so many have enjoyed.
“ God be with you, my dear friend...... with love and respect, Mick Fleetwood. ”
Green’s death was confirmed in the statement of Swan Turton, a lawyer: “The family of Peter Green reports with great grief that Peter died during the weekend, peacefully sleeping.
A further declaration will be published in the next few days."
Green leaves behind a daughter, Rosebud Samuels-Greenbaum, who he had with his ex-wife, Jane Samuels.
Green founded Fleetwood Mac with Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, the band originally called "Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer".
In 1970, however, the singer left the band after four records.
Fleetwood Mac would receive great praise and popularity worldwide after more people joined the group, including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on Rumours and Tusk records.
As Prince Joakim said,
Prince Joakim Dana, the younger son of Margaret Thorhild, Queen of Danad, and Prince Henrik, are still in a hospital in Toulouse, France, where he had surgery last day because of a blood clot in the brain.
The Danish State Radio, D.R., notes that the speaker of the Danish court is not sure how long the 51 - year - old prince will be in the hospital, but his feelings are stable.
According to the report of D.R., the effects of the blood clot on the Prince’s health are now being investigated.
It is noted by the doctor Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who deals with the health of DR, that blood clots in the brain often do not occur until days after surgery.
“ It can be from insignificant symptoms to an accident, memory problems, or problems with expression, ” says Geisling.
He says the prince could wait for a long rehabilitation for months.
Prince Joakim Dana, who is fully named Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and also a Count of Monpezat, stayed on the family vineyard, Château de Cayx, Southern France, when he got sick on Friday night.
He was first taken to a hospital in Cahors, near the farm, and then moved to the university hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent surgery because of a blood clot in the brain.
Google Pixel 4 can form the galaxy
A double optical attraction enables the extra lens of Pixel 4 to be seen in a three-dimensional dimension and thus produces a better blur in the background with a face image setting than in previous Pixel phones, which relied on the alpha software to achieve these so-called "bookeh" effects.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google's mythological photographer Annie Leibovitz was brought up in a field to discuss his experience with Pixel 4 in the last 12 months.
Engineering is still in the foreground of all aspects of Google's new smartphones, and on this phone, “computer-Managed Photography” is new to improve the HDR+ settings by unifying up to nine different images.
New two-fold description controls offer different slides for brightness and shadow and enable users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on engineering to offer a better automatic whitening and a better “Night Sight” night setting, which is so sensitive that it can capture the galaxy on the night sky.
In addition to another camera-general, Pixel 4 Soli introduces “road-saw-chip scans” on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense movements so that users can release the track, turn off the timers, put the alarm on the sleep or turn off the sound of the phone by wavering the hand.
All the calculations of the Motion Sense are performed in the device instead of connecting the Internet, and the same applies to the enhanced Google helper, where the technician now stresses shortening response time and improving the personal protection of users.
The continued emphasis of Google on using its engineering capabilities has also resulted in a new voice recording app that rewrites live sounds without sending data to the Internet.
The app is available only in English, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone that supports Google Stadia, the game scene in the cloud that will be released from the stocks of November 19, but still afterwards report the date for Australia.
In addition to new Pixel phones, Google also introduced new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and other generations Google Pixel Buds listening tools.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smarthearing tools, which are expected to be next year, are wireless and have a sound adapter that listens to the environment and conforms to it in order to make it as clear as possible.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smarthearing tools are completely wireless and set the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also announced an update of its conjugated Wi-Fi homelines in the Nest Wi-Fi line with special bones, along with many bases working together to improve the wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest name, doubles its predecessor and adds a built-in microphone and speaker to use the Google helper at each base of the home.
It's on sale in Australia November 5th and costs 399 Australians for bones and one Wi-Fi point or $549 for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but new $79 Nest Mini improves the sound quality by double bass and has received a built-in wall mounting.
All Google smart speakers will receive a new call system feature for communication between devices in the home, as well as the ability to call the Nest Mini outside the home using the Google Home app.

Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester are fighting for the last two seats of the championship after the champions of Liverpool and Manchester City, which are in second place.
One point separates the three stages, and Leicester welcomes United.
Wolverhampton and Tottenam are fighting for their seats in the European Union.
Aston Villa, Watford and Bournemouth want to avoid the bottom seats left by Norwich, which is already dead.
When one game is left, Jamie Vardy from Leicester is the top 23-point player, two more than Danny Ings from Southampton, and three more than Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Arsenal.
The play of getting into the elite department begins with the fact that Swansea welcomes Brentford in their first predecessor game.
Fulham plays with Cardiff in the other outlines starting on Monday.
Leeds and West Bromwich have already escaped from the next department.
Juventus can beat his own record by getting the ninth title of Series A, winning Sampdoria.
This would result in Bianconeri seven grades after Inter Milan, which is second when two games are left.
On the other hand, Lecce needs to work in Bologna in order to have a further hope to avoid falling down.
Lecce is four points behind Genoa, which is 17th and is one game first.
A fisherman “saw a bottle of beer in seal ” in Devon
According to a charity organization, a fisherman threw a bottle of beer into the seal when he disturbed the hunting line.
Photos taken at the Hope's Nose near Torquay seem to show a man on a rock that throws an object towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey seal was hunting when the pole hunter emptied a bottle and threw it in the back of the animal.
Kenny called it “frightful and unreasonable behavior. ”
He said he was picking up garbage at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning, along with other people in Seal Project Seal Protection Society when he witnessed the attack.
“The seller tried to get into the hunting line, ” he said.
“ The fisherman stretched the beer, emptyed the bottle, and threw it into the seal.
"The frog landed on the back of the seal and he swim away."
Teacher said that “fortunately they sold strong - built animals ” rather than that the seller was simply doing what was inherent in him.
“ By throwing a bottle of glass into him, ” he said, “you are stopping him on his hunting. ”
The Seal Project Company said that it was “not a unique instance ” and that it had recently received“ many announcements of this aggressive behaviour. ”
In the Facebook records, its volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage in the collection at Hope's Nose on Sunday and “many examples of antisocial behavior ” had been seen.
All sellers enjoy protection under seals protection laws, and people are asked to stay away from them.
A Giant of Christian Polli, Laxá, Dalum
The first one was caught in Laxa in Dalum the second part of the day.
Arnor Isfjörd, son of Godmund, was there.
This morning, he had put in a pile in Christianity, and it was 89 inches [89 cm].
After noon, Christian pole was again available, and he was thought of a story that he had heard that the slower often noticed the catching of the hawk.
With this in mind, he took the Collie Dog's crown and threw it over Kristnapoll.
Soon he was taken, and as he himself tells.
“ After about five seconds, he cleansed himself completely, and I realized that it was the metre.
I became a little stressed because I had 11 pounds of restraint.
I usually catch fish, but I had this forty minutes.
Actually, he was quite comfortable.
Did a few trips up and down the pond, but then I got to beach him, and it was a great feeling.
Rocked my pole and jumped on it.
He measured 102 inches [102 cm], and I twirled him," said a cheerful hunter in the hunting house in Laxá, Dalum, in a conversation with a scourge.
Arnor is as if no one was starting when it comes to a hundred.
That was his eighth.
He received such fish in the Lena, the Black River, the Rabbit, the Kjarah, the two in the river Langadal, and the one in the East of Ranga.
According to Arnor, a fine hunt is located in Laxá in Dalum.
The hollow that finishs noon tomorrow's got 35 salmon and our man has eighteen of them.
Expecting Great Floods for Hannah
Hannah, the first hurricane of the Atlantic Ocean in this year, reached Texas, U.S.A., last night.
Hannah quickly lost power and became a storm, but despite this, there has been a great rainfall in the area and expected large floods.
It is expected to rain up to 30 inches [30 cm] in one day, but in special places it could reach up to 46 inches [46 cm], according to the AP News.
Especially is it warned of dramatic floods that might occur because of the rainfall.
The area where Hanna reached the land has been struck by the great distribution of the new corona virus there.
In addition, waters have gone into land and have caused damage.
Now there are at least 43,700 people without electricity, and there have been a number of aid stations in the area.
The U.S. president Donald Trump was in the storm last night, saying that people listen to experts and follow instructions.
See the footage of the AP - reporter this morning.
House burned, shops robbed and injured
More than sixty have died and sixty more have been wounded after attack in the village of Masteri in Darfur County in Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in a series of serious security incidents in the last few weeks in which houses were burned, shops and markets were robbed and damaged, ” says the United Nations Human Rights Office in the capital of Kartum, sent out today.
Abdalla Hamdok, Prime Minister of Sudan, has announced that security troops will be sent to the war - stricken province to “protect the inhabitants and the harvest. ”
Only two days ago, unknown troops in the area killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack.
“ The increase in violence in different parts of the Darfur region is leading to an increase in circumvention, jeopardizing agriculture and threaten lives and livelihoods, ” says the United Nations.
The conflict in Darfur, in the west part of Sudan, began in 2003 when rebels, most of the Arabs, resurrected against the governor of Kartum.
The military forces of governments and Arab troops who tried to put an end to the rebellion have been accused of widespread cruelty, but some 300,000 were killed in the fights, according to the United Nations estimate.
Omas al-Bashir, cast off as Sudan’s leader, is called for by the International Criminal Court for a suspected war crime, genocide, and crime against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, new governments in Sudan are now trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
A TV Newswoman Thanks A Spectator for Noting Cancer Knots
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — A TV newswoman in Florida thanks an observer’s attention for having noticed a knot on her neck and emailed her that she should be checked.
Victoria Price, a reporter for WFLA, Tampa, followed this advice and developed cancer.
Price said on Twitter that she was going to surgery on Monday to have her tumour, thyroid, and a few lymph nodes removed.
“The doctor said it was spreading, but not too much, and we hope that this will be my first and last operation, ” she said.
The audience sent Price email last month and said that the knot reminded her of a knot that she had had.
Price, a 28 - year - old researcher, said this week that her TV station slogan was “8 on your side. ”
“ But the roles changed recently when the audience was on the team with ME, and I couldn’t be more grateful, ” said Price.
“ I will forever be grateful to the woman who made an effort to send me an e - mail, a completely stranger.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did.
Speaking of being with a man in a team."
Part of the outdoor area Jeronimo Open Space closed temporarily after two coyotes attacks – CBS Los Angeles
Two were bit by coyotes near the Oso Creek route on the Jeronimo Road of Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and had to close the route temporarily.
Laura Wittmer says she sees coyotes almost every morning, and usually she tries to avoid them just, but on Saturday morning one came straight to her and bit her in the leg.
The walkway has been closed while the attacks are investigated.
Mission Viejo City published: “Today two different parties announced that a coyote had biten a person; the animal welfare service Mission Viejo is working on the matter in cooperation with the branch of fish and animals, and parts of Jeronimo Open Space have been closed; be careful and watchful when traveling with wild animals. ”
Wittmer tried to beat off the coyote with a bottle of water.
She called the emergency line to get a ride to her car, but she was able to drive to an emergency hospital.
The coyote disappeared in the hills, but official workers hope to fire it and test it for rabies.
Wittmer will be treated for rabies as a precaution for the next two weeks.
She said that this horrible incident would not keep her from the morning races, but from now on, she would choose another place.
The situation of the other person who was bitten is not clear.
Racist hatred Protestants Join Seattle Police
Conflicts in Seattle on Sunday between police and Protestant against racist hatred ended with arrests, but dissatisfied demands among the public because of the United States president Donald Trump’s plans to send a number of federal policemen into major cities.
Protests against racial hatred and police violence have arisen after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis in May.
In Seattle, protestors cut wheelbars and broke windows in wheelchairs on Saturday’s protests, causing the police to declare a state of turmoil and empty the streets with pepper sprays and flash bombs.
Protestants also set fire to wheelchairs in a building area for an anticipated teenage prison.
The police claimed to have arrested 45 people, but 21 police officers would have been injured.
The protest was held in support of the protests that prevail in the neighbouring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is on the scene after Trump has ordered very controversial acts of federal police, unpleasant local authorities, who say the police are exaggerating excessive power.
Protesting tours have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of the state of Texas, one was shot to death in armed conflicts in the city on Saturday night, according to the police.
Concomitant with the Protests, Trump is increasingly difficult to fight for re-election in November, and has adopted a harsh police policy.
